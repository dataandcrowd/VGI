## 1. Background
**VGI has emerged since the era of Web2.0.** 
* Volunteering geographic information (VGI) or geographic crowdsourcing has been beneficial to our society with regard to gathering adequate information where one cannot acquire from.
* "VGI is, in a sense, postmodern GIS, in which individuals are able to assert their own views of their surroundings and play a part in local decision making" [(Goodchild, 2007)](https://www.esri.com/news/arcuser/0410/vgi.html).


**The role of crowd has become more important than ever.**
* According to [Brown (2017)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/tgis.12207), crowd, in the context of VGI, is defined as the public whose interests are in spatial information and technology, and can willingly devote their time to create up-to-date and accurate resources to help the readers. 
* It is very much dependent on local economic conditions and the quality of life.
* Crowd can be distinguished into three groups: 1) by the type of people, 2) by geographic boundaries, 3) by the internet users.
    - Type of People: Decision makers, stakeholders, implementers, interested observers, and the random public
    - Geography: within a spatial boundary, local people with spatial-cognitive knowledge about their neighbourhood
    - Internet users: An online population


**The Under-represented Crowds**
* Who are they: 
    * A silent minority who needs information about public facilities
    * A community with local knowledge but weakness in internet technology
    * A population that has restrictions on the update due to language or censoring issues 
* The oppposite group:
    * The elite, western, english-speaking male ([Gardens, 2020](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10708-019-10035-z); [Haworth, 2018](https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/feart.2018.00183))
    * System development and maintenance is mainly done by them

**Why should we consider under-represented crowds in VGI studies?**
* To improve spatial mapping bias
    * Mapped areas get more attention and information while others don’t 
    * For example, Europe & N.America vs Rest of the world; Urban vs Rural
    * Level of expertise can vary: people with geographical knowledge
* To fill missing data
    * Names in the local areas are different from the officially recognized names that appear on maps  
    * Political and social marginalization of those left off the map (Elwood, 2008).
    * Hidden data may be regarded as least important → neglect social support


------

**Critiques from Previous Studies**
* Biased samples have been thoroughly discussed in previous papers, but the context was either to assess the likelihood of imbalance between groups (quantitatively or qualitatively) or have raised sampling errors that is statistically not accepted
* Studies are often focused on one particular topic in isolation thus does not make it suitable in all applications
* To our knowledge, none of the published reviews identified or analysed the available evidence from a strict systematic approach. To get more ideas of which under-represented group is highlighted, this review will not constrain the discipline nor type of platforms


------

**Research Objective**
* This paper conducts a systematic review to identify and analyse the main components of under-represented participants in various VGI projects and the outlook to encourage diverse participation in future geospatial crowdsourcing. 

**Research Questions**
* What discipline or journal type have published VGI projects? What are their themes?
* Does the study have meaningful differences when defining the term sampling bias? (output) ⇒ Do we see any difference in the map? (sampling bias does matter!)
* Which (non)demographic group has mostly/least contributed to the project? ⇒ Gender
* What type of solution has been raised from the scientific community in terms of inducing diverse participants? ⇒ Solution or awareness of the limitations of the group




## 2. Preparation for the Review
### 2.1. Scope of this study
* We focus on the **participants** of VGI
* Why?

### 2.2. Conceptual Framework
* A conceptual model is developed to indicate the type of determinants of participants in VGI by social scales
* Social scales range from individual self to lifestyle factors, community level factors, and environmental factors
* 분류할 때 보다 어떠한 요소들에서 더 많은 차별이 나는지 확인할 수 있기 때문이다.
* 좌측과 우측의 화살표에 해당하는 요소들은 정반대의 특성을 나타내고 있는데....(이거 적어야 함) 4가지 요소들은 기존 연구들이 지적한 부분들을 나열한 것임

### 2.3. Building a team
* Speciallist in this area who can choose the appriate papers to include/exclude
* Statistician who can get involved in the extensive work of retrieving, screening and coding.
* The balance betewen topic and mothodological skills is important. 
* > A team with specialties on the topic but without skills in review may 
    * struggle to complete the review at all; 
    * be tempted to limit their searching; 
    * or harbour a vested interest in a particular outcome of the review
* > The opposite
    * missing important contextual details (particularly when developing the contextual framework)
    * neither understanding the broader theoretical or political position  nor understanding where the review fits in a particular body of knowledge
