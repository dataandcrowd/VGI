Hyesop is a quantitative geographer interested in themes including environmental hazards, urban air quality, individual mobility patterns, which are likely to be real-world problems. To tackle these issues, Hyesop apply methods including GIScience and agent-based modelling (ABM). Prior to joining Glasgow, I completed my PhD at the University of Cambridge where I looked at how  individuals exposure to air pollution can differ by commuting routes and socioeconomic backgrounds using an agent-based simulation. 

At Glasgow, his current project unravels the benefits of using crowdsourcing to help improve our understanding of locational services for the  under-represented groups. One example is to highlight toilets, childcare service, domestic violence shelters for women, and provide wheelchair service points and pathfinding routes for the physically disabled.
