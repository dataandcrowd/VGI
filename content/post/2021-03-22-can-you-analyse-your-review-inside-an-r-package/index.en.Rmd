## tl;dr

- We will do a bunch of analysis from the search database
- The papers are retrieved from [**SCOPUS**](https://www.scopus.com/search/form.uri?display=basic#basic)
- Published papers written in English were exported to a `.bib` file
- We used an R package "bibliometrix" ([URL](https://www.bibliometrix.org/index.html)) to explore the results

# 2. Publications and Citations
## Total Publication
For citations, we found that papers started to get actively published after 2013, where the numbers peaked at 77 papers in 2018. As the literature of VGI is growing according to the, we are hoping to get more results in the upcoming years.

## Citations

* While there were fluctuations in the total citations during 2002-2006, the keyword "Volunteered Geographic Information" started to get cited from 2007 after Goodchild's paper "Citizens as sensors: the world of volunteered geography" published at *GeoJournal*.
* Citation seems to decrease sharply
* However, as VGI is getting more attention, more published papers are citing papers in latest years.

# 3. Top Author's Productivity over Time
Here, we analyse the trend of authors productivity over time. I know it is brutal to analyse somebody's academic performance based on the quantity not the quality, but this hints us how scholars are continuously working on VGI projects. 


From the figure below, we can see Linda See ranked on the 1st place. She is affilliated in IIASA, Austria where she works on VGI and citizen science with international scholars mostly from Europe. Steffen Fritz looks to me as the most consistent VGI scholar amongst others. He published papers from 2009 to 2020, and he is also affilliated in IIASA, Austria.

# 4. Collaboration
As previously mentioned, the first figure below shows that the USA, Germany, and the UK are the highest producing countries of the world. Although the links doesn't show the strength of collaboration, it is highly likely from the other statstics that the network between European countries is strong compared to other continents.

The next figure is the centrality and betweenness amongst published papers. We can see that Goodchild's paper ["Citizens as sensors: the world of volunteered geography"](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10708-007-9111-y) was in the centre of the graph where it got cited over 210 times in WoS (>5,000 in Google Scholar). As the term is new and created from an active researcher, it been continuously cited over years.

# 5. Our Next Step

I found that the `bibliometrix` are focusing on the networks of co-citations from the collections, but can only work on one database at a time. Each database requires different search queries and options for which the researcher can opt for, but there is less flexibility in `bibliometrix`.

I am currently working on ways to integrate the bibliography across databases and examine the results after removing the duplicates.
