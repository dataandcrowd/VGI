000-324-140-892-743,On Data Quality Assurance and Conflation Entanglement in Crowdsourcing for Environmental Studies,2017-03-11,2017,journal article,ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information,22209964,MDPI AG,Switzerland,Didier G. Leibovici; Julian F. Rosser; Crona Hodges; Barry Evans; Mike Jackson; Chris Higgins,"Volunteer geographical information (VGI), either in the context of citizen science or the mining of social media, has proven to be useful in various domains including natural hazards, health status, disease epidemics, and biological monitoring. Nonetheless, the variable or unknown data quality due to crowdsourcing settings are still an obstacle for fully integrating these data sources in environmental studies and potentially in policy making. The data curation process, in which a quality assurance (QA) is needed, is often driven by the direct usability of the data collected within a data conflation process or data fusion (DCDF), combining the crowdsourced data into one view, using potentially other data sources as well. Looking at current practices in VGI data quality and using two examples, namely land cover validation and inundation extent estimation, this paper discusses the close links between QA and DCDF. It aims to help in deciding whether a disentanglement can be possible, whether beneficial or not, in understanding the data curation process with respect to its methodology for future usage of crowdsourced data. Analysing situations throughout the data curation process where and when entanglement between QA and DCDF occur, the paper explores the various facets of VGI data capture, as well as data quality assessment and purposes. Far from rejecting the usability ISO quality criterion, the paper advocates for a decoupling of the QA process and the DCDF step as much as possible while still integrating them within an approach analogous to a Bayesian paradigm",6,3,78,,Automatic identification and data capture; Quality assurance; Conflation; Usability; Geography; Data quality; Data science; Volunteered geographic information; Crowdsourcing; Data curation,,,,Seventh Framework Programme,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ijgi/ijgi6.html#LeiboviciRHEJH17 https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/6/3/78 https://core.ac.uk/display/89991630 https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/6/3/78/pdf http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017IJGI....6...78L/abstract http://www.isprs-ann-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/II-3-W5/195/2015/isprsannals-II-3-W5-195-2015.pdf https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi6030078 https://dissem.in/p/29993104/on-data-quality-assurance-and-conflation-entanglement-in-crowdsourcing-for-environmental-studies https://doaj.org/article/a7b25fced9184c5b8dfa5d8921694a9e,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi6030078,10.3390/ijgi6030078,2595779829,,0,002-555-907-164-663; 007-857-101-229-718; 010-390-048-140-045; 011-014-349-482-329; 011-429-970-594-438; 012-944-780-631-886; 014-845-068-774-33X; 023-910-534-464-860; 027-736-997-184-595; 036-045-596-267-027; 036-756-046-258-434; 038-976-596-179-447; 040-267-517-107-219; 046-026-102-253-397; 046-034-795-163-238; 049-070-739-575-761; 049-684-449-089-85X; 049-985-939-099-144; 053-620-292-475-147; 054-859-619-242-072; 061-264-928-243-686; 071-175-593-029-415; 072-399-891-869-702; 083-148-286-053-230; 087-529-691-896-842; 088-535-756-565-284; 091-311-841-947-311; 097-612-174-011-049; 119-783-316-052-720; 147-436-998-387-753; 150-597-705-102-79X; 158-400-294-926-346; 158-840-828-561-230; 164-117-034-807-950; 171-544-875-588-246; 187-545-186-087-927,14,,(doi) 10.3390/ijgi6030078; (coreid) 89991630; (magid) 2595779829,en

Research has proven that the resulting data in some areas are of decent quality, which guarantees their usability in various applications. Though these achievements are normally attributed to the huge heterogeneous community mainly consisting of amateurs, it is in fact a small percentage of major contributors who make nearly all contributions. In this paper, we investigate the contributing behaviors of these contributors to deduce whether they are actually professionals. Various indicators are used to depict the behaviors on three themes: practice, skill and motivation, aiming to identify solid evidence for expertise. Our case studies show that most major contributors in Germany, France and the United Kingdom are hardly amateurs, but are professionals instead. These contributors have rich experiences on geographical data editing, have a decent grasp of professional software and work on the project with enthusiasm and concentration. It is less unexpected that they can create geographic data of high quality",5,2,21,,Usability; GRASP; Geography; Data editing; Amateur; Enthusiasm; Knowledge management; Volunteered geographic information,,,,,http://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/5/2/21 https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/5/2/21/pdf https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016IJGI....5...21Y/abstract https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi5020021 https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/5/2/21 https://core.ac.uk/display/90633022 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ijgi/ijgi5.html#YangFJ16 https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi5020021,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi5020021,10.3390/ijgi5020021,2287642693,,0,008-714-358-699-609; 012-148-090-232-186; 014-348-277-735-954; 017-614-610-102-13X; 021-041-484-242-674; 021-624-773-712-198; 022-473-450-579-960; 026-645-756-189-301; 030-975-962-975-895; 032-353-715-439-039; 038-976-596-179-447; 040-267-517-107-219; 041-776-012-221-771; 047-100-212-874-054; 056-483-995-783-139; 057-545-918-303-995; 088-339-711-439-200; 091-204-512-390-272; 097-612-174-011-049; 097-622-766-000-537; 099-169-442-324-498; 104-199-994-805-907; 111-901-923-536-480; 117-889-713-446-267; 118-057-611-878-127; 122-656-286-991-79X; 171-544-875-588-246; 190-216-777-739-959,18,,(coreid) 90633022; (doi) 10.3390/ijgi5020021; (magid) 2287642693,en

A massively popular augmented reality game, Pokémon GO, recently adopted OSM data for its in-game map and many of its in-game mechanics. This study investigated: (1) How Pokémon GO affected the quantity of daily contributors and daily edits to OSM in South Korea (the only country where OSM data was used exclusively since the game’s launch); and (2) How the game affected volunteers’ contribution habits. The main findings were: (i) the number of daily contributors and daily edits both increased by more than 17 times following the launch of Pokémon GO in South Korea, but returned to more normal levels after around 1&amp;amp;frac12; months; (ii) Most individuals contributing to OSM because of Pokémon GO reportedly did so to improve the in-game map appearance and in-game mechanics; and (iii) Individuals motivated to contribute to OSM because of Pokémon GO tended to create/edit OSM “park” and “water body” features more than other OSM contributors. It is notable that the large increases in OSM contributors and edits occurred even in the absence of any formal guidance or encouragement by the game operator or other parties. If greater efforts are made to encourage participation in VGI initiatives linked to AR games, the observed impacts will likely be even more dramatic.&lt;/p&gt;;                     </jats:p>",2,,54,4,Internet privacy; Sociology; Augmented reality; Water body; Volunteered geographic information,,,,,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019PrICA...2...54J/abstract https://noa.gwlb.de/receive/cop_mods_00001351 https://iges.or.jp/en/pub/how-augmented-reality-game-pok%C3%A9mon-go-affected https://www.proc-int-cartogr-assoc.net/2/54/2019/ica-proc-2-54-2019.pdf https://www.proc-int-cartogr-assoc.net/2/54/2019/ https://iges.or.jp/system/files/publication_documents/pub/peer/7035/ica-proc-2-54-2019.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/ica-proc-2-54-2019,10.5194/ica-proc-2-54-2019,2958909673,,0,,2,,(doi) 10.5194/ica-proc-2-54-2019; (magid) 2958909673,en

Gent; Howard F. Schwartz; Rajiv Khosla,"Gent, D. H., Schwartz, H. F., and Khosla, R. 2004. Distribution and incidence of Iris yellow spot virus in Colorado and its relation to onion plant population and yield. Plant Dis. 88:446-452. Iris yellow spot virus (IYSV) is an emerging and potentially devastating disease of onion that was recently detected in Colorado and other onion producing regions in the western United States. In annual surveys, IYSV was confirmed in one of 18 fields (5.6%) in 2001, four of 24 (16.7%) in 2002, and 41 of 56 (73.2%) in 2003. IYSV was confirmed on volunteer onions in 2003 at all four locations where IYSV was observed in the onion crop the previous year. The disease was detected in six of seven western Colorado onion fields surveyed in 2003, but was not observed any year in southern or northeastern Colorado. The spatial variability of disease incidence, yield, and plant population also was mapped in two fields in 2003 using the global positioning system and a geographic information system. Disease incidence varied among cultivars, plant population, fields, and location in the field. Distinct disease gradients were observed in both fields with susceptible cultivars Teton and Granero, but not in the moderately resistant cultivar Sterling. In fields planted to the susceptible cultivars, disease incidence was highest on the field edges and lowest near the field centers. Plant population was negatively correlated with IYSV incidence in cultivar Sterling (R 2 = 0.56, P = 0.003), but not with the susceptible cultivars. Yield of jumbo market class onions, but not total yield, was negatively correlated with increasing IYSV incidence (R 2 = 0.37, P = 0.012) in cultivar Teton. Colossal market class yield, but not other yield components, was negatively correlated with IYSV incidence in cultivar Sterling (R2 = 0.28, P = 0.061). The results of these studies indicate the distribution of IYSV is rapidly expanding in Colorado and is associated with a general reduction in bulb size.",88,5,446,452,Plant virus; Bulb; Crop yield; Crop; Horticulture; Cultivar; Tospovirus; Incidence (epidemiology); Botany; Biology; Plant disease resistance,null; GIS; GPS; tospovirus,,,,https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20043078610 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30812646,http://dx.doi.org/10.1094/pdis.2004.88.5.446,10.1094/pdis.2004.88.5.446,2141437720,,0,002-744-193-030-69X; 002-785-960-769-964; 016-786-976-925-514; 018-549-052-681-04X; 023-255-255-736-984; 023-580-135-834-335; 029-351-754-040-218; 029-459-814-458-363; 040-136-676-539-473; 040-892-075-247-081; 043-297-491-385-259; 048-759-597-164-652; 058-282-355-471-657; 059-630-050-149-581; 070-544-478-913-517; 082-983-910-215-428; 099-526-556-851-387; 105-038-571-034-775; 156-507-714-319-110,81,,(magid) 2141437720; (pmid) 30812646; (doi) 10.1094/pdis.2004.88.5.446,en

Two families of counter-strategies deployed in amateur mapping communities are discussed. First, the contributors organize forms of policing, based on volunteered community involvement, patrolling the maps and reporting incidents.

002-167-242-221-680,Mapping with Stakeholders: An Overview of Public Participatory GIS and VGI in Transport Decision-Making,2019-04-24,2019,journal article,ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information,22209964,MDPI AG,Switzerland,Nadia Giuffrida; Michela Le Pira; Giuseppe Inturri; Matteo Ignaccolo,"Transport decision-making problems are typically spatially based and involve a set of feasible alternatives with multiple evaluation criteria. Besides, transport decisions affect citizens’ quality of life, as well as specific interests of general stakeholders (e.g., transport companies), thus needing a participatory approach to decision-making. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) have the ability to visualize spatial data and represent the impact of location based transport alternatives, thus helping experts to conduct robust assessments. Moreover, with the recent diffusion of Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) and development of Public Participatory GIS (PPGIS) platforms, the process can be enhanced thanks to the collection of a large amount of updated spatial data and the achievement of an active community participation. In this study, we provide an overview based on a structured literature review of the use of VGI and PPGIS in transport studies, exploring the fields of application, role played by GIS, level of public involvement and decision stage at which they are applied. From the overview’s results, we propose a general framework for the evaluation of transport alternatives using GIS from a multiple stakeholder point of view; the main conclusion is the usefulness of the integration between Public Participation, GIS and quantitative evaluation methods, in particular Multi Criteria Decision Analysis, in order to foster technically sound and shared decisions.",8,4,198,,Multiple-criteria decision analysis; Spatial analysis; Public participation; Participatory GIS; Transportation planning; Computer science; Geographic information system; Public participation GIS; Knowledge management; Volunteered geographic information,,,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/8/4/198/pdf https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi8040198 https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/8/4/198 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019IJGI....8..198G/abstract https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ijgi/ijgi8.html#GiuffridaPII19 https://www.iris.unict.it/handle/20.500.11769/366099 http://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi8040198,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi8040198,10.3390/ijgi8040198,2942283335,,0,001-258-153-244-757; 002-289-130-158-571; 004-352-602-061-148; 004-780-758-131-529; 004-806-499-017-475; 005-859-545-795-67X; 006-645-727-854-83X; 009-449-866-817-415; 012-188-535-471-697; 014-348-461-428-399; 014-650-519-835-77X; 015-065-423-128-973; 015-838-469-820-668; 018-071-800-433-181; 019-858-329-201-383; 020-306-849-686-935; 021-837-451-246-728; 023-896-617-260-427; 025-627-163-529-328; 028-107-527-053-907; 029-950-131-115-839; 031-920-369-638-36X; 033-364-197-415-159; 033-887-086-154-913; 035-115-161-929-567; 036-232-143-978-014; 038-128-569-241-952; 038-473-036-344-411; 040-403-446-175-540; 044-182-665-236-605; 044-465-992-583-313; 046-125-346-020-083; 047-775-461-489-056; 048-467-969-121-430; 049-276-059-593-118; 051-732-318-709-84X; 052-660-858-188-826; 055-361-485-591-493; 057-499-818-661-598; 057-545-918-303-995; 058-471-185-716-692; 060-779-261-884-173; 061-339-659-412-990; 063-231-503-055-665; 064-619-421-470-619; 070-664-738-146-622; 075-055-324-161-337; 075-597-475-535-304; 075-609-191-146-804; 076-950-256-427-806; 080-212-373-943-842; 082-727-730-029-377; 083-305-001-046-130; 084-302-336-294-120; 084-860-197-320-291; 085-398-975-317-160; 086-203-673-633-604; 091-311-048-157-111; 102-160-469-693-977; 102-508-347-569-884; 107-779-871-429-016; 108-732-236-508-733; 110-966-876-500-004; 113-191-016-208-562; 115-138-381-291-317; 115-147-831-956-027; 116-890-402-799-411; 119-145-186-995-088; 127-655-403-797-492; 127-868-267-141-526; 134-178-509-686-058; 139-381-311-342-925; 139-912-118-574-409; 143-305-609-340-72X; 154-848-889-994-591; 161-282-888-210-031; 174-856-559-116-863; 187-970-868-476-580,10,,(doi) 10.3390/ijgi8040198; (magid) 2942283335,en

Foody; Linda See; Steffen Fritz; M. van der Velde; Christoph Perger; Christian Schill; Doreen S. Boyd,"The recent rise of neogeography and citizen sensing has increased the opportunities for the use of crowdsourcing as a means to acquire data to support geographical research. The value of the resulting volunteered geographic information is, however, often limited by concerns associated with its quality and the degree to which the contributing data sources may be trusted. Here, information on the quality of sources of volunteered geographic information was derived using a latent class analysis. The volunteered information was on land cover interpreted visually from satellite sensor images and the main focus was on the labeling of 299 sites by seven of the 65 volunteers who contributed to an Internet-based collaborative project. Using the information on land cover acquired by the multiple volunteers it was shown that the relative, but not absolute, quality of the data from different volunteers could be characterized accurately. Additionally, class-specific variations in the quality of the information provided by a single volunteer could be characterized by the analysis. The latent class analysis, therefore, was able to provide information on the quality of information provided on an inter- and intra-volunteer basis.",17,6,847,860,The Internet; Geography; Information retrieval; Data science; Neogeography; Land cover; Internet based; Information quality; Volunteered geographic information; Crowdsourcing; Latent class model,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1111/tgis.12033 http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/10425/ https://nottingham-repository.worktribe.com/output/1000479 https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tgis.12033 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tgis.12033/abstract http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/2450/ https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/tgis.12033 http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tgis.12033 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/tgis/tgis17.html#FoodySFVPSB13,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tgis.12033,10.1111/tgis.12033,1894564341,,0,000-278-753-205-884; 003-677-713-873-99X; 007-857-101-229-718; 008-228-229-971-350; 011-675-217-913-914; 014-753-224-456-758; 015-576-334-059-042; 017-073-459-509-914; 019-362-199-226-515; 020-241-105-547-516; 022-473-450-579-960; 023-494-124-775-228; 024-723-379-221-772; 026-645-756-189-301; 027-265-650-766-096; 027-486-299-838-927; 029-168-048-151-871; 040-267-517-107-219; 045-201-107-411-584; 049-524-737-748-351; 054-941-787-662-255; 057-545-918-303-995; 063-392-296-214-893; 069-048-542-531-065; 071-165-077-549-626; 072-243-912-426-29X; 075-297-478-041-735; 085-221-214-334-157; 088-339-711-439-200; 089-361-446-433-568; 092-652-930-589-909; 100-061-368-250-820; 122-656-286-991-79X; 124-043-027-110-303; 124-331-219-122-778; 134-083-809-434-096; 141-047-060-911-705; 157-379-975-670-921; 171-544-875-588-246; 195-700-115-416-356,96,,(coreid) 141249424; (magid) 1894564341; (doi) 10.1111/tgis.12033,en

Grus; D. te Winkel,<jats:p>Abstract. Since Topographical Key Register has become an open data the amount of users increased enormously. The highest grow was in the private users group. The increasing number of users and their growing demand for high actuality of the topographic data sets motivates the Dutch Kadaster to innovate and improve the Topographical Key Register (BRT). One of the initiatives was to provide a voluntary geographical information project aiming at providing a user-friendly feedback system adjusted to all kinds of user groups. The feedback system is a compulsory element of the Topographical Key Register in the Netherlands. The Dutch Kadaster is obliged to deliver a feedback system and the key-users are obliged to use it. The aim of the feedback system is to improve the quality and stimulate the usage of the data. The results of the pilot shows that the user-friendly and open to everyone feedback system contributes enormously to improve the quality of the topographic dataset.;                     </jats:p>,XL-3/W3,,51,54,Data mining; Geography; Data science; Open data; User group; Topographic map; Volunteered geographic information; Data set; Crowdsourcing,,,,,https://noa.gwlb.de/receive/cop_mods_00015511 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ISPAr.XL3...51G/abstract http://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/XL-3-W3/51/2015/isprsarchives-XL-3-W3-51-2015.pdf https://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/XL-3-W3/51/2015/,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/isprsarchives-xl-3-w3-51-2015,10.5194/isprsarchives-xl-3-w3-51-2015,2298089010,,0,091-367-012-578-769; 147-127-811-573-697,1,,(magid) 2298089010; (coreid) 92185933; (doi) 10.5194/isprsarchives-xl-3-w3-51-2015,en

However, these applications and quality assessments are generally focused on images associated with geolocation through textual annotations, which is only part of valid images to them. In this paper, we explore the distribution pattern for most relevant VGI images of specific landmarks to extend the current quality analysis, and to provide guidance for improving the data-retrieval process of geographic applications. Distribution is explored in terms of two aspects, namely, semantic distribution and spatial distribution. In this paper, the term semantic distribution is used to describe the matching of building-image tags and content with each other. There are three kinds of images (semantic-relevant and content-relevant, semantic-relevant but content-irrelevant, and semantic-irrelevant but content-relevant). Spatial distribution shows how relevant images are distributed around a landmark. The process of this work can be divided into three parts: data filtering, retrieval of relevant landmark images, and distribution analysis. For semantic distribution, statistical results show that an average of 60% of images tagged with the building’s name actually represents the building, while 69% of images depicting the building are not annotated with the building’s name. There was also an observation that for most landmarks, 97% of relevant building images were located within 300 m around the building in terms of spatial distribution.</jats:p>",8,9,418,,Geolocation; Information retrieval; Spatial distribution; Landmark; Data source; Data filtering; Distribution pattern; Computer science; Volunteered geographic information,,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China-Yunnan Joint Fund,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi8090418 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ijgi/ijgi8.html#DingF19 https://ntnuopen.ntnu.no/ntnu-xmlui/handle/11250/2641656 https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/8/9/418 https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/8/9/418/pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi8090418,10.3390/ijgi8090418,2973945743,,0,000-612-749-921-969; 020-132-620-861-048; 028-303-905-295-179; 067-256-046-078-584; 072-346-674-622-560; 090-711-745-810-346; 098-440-015-522-27X; 127-491-841-235-58X; 156-096-618-588-00X,2,,(doi) 10.3390/ijgi8090418; (magid) 2973945743,en

McNeally,"Abstract Gaps in hate crime and hate incident data are a major roadblock in increasing our understanding of the rising phenomenon of hate in the United States. In this paper, we reflect on the development of our geographically-integrated mobile application (the Hate Incident Reporting System) as an attempt to help close the gap in hate incident data. More broadly, we provide conceptual and methodological insights for working with sensitive Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) like hate incidents. We identify four key areas of attention in the process of developing digital tools for collecting sensitive VGI: i) participant motivation ii) data management and public research communication iii) accessibility iv) handling of geographic information and v) partnership with existing stakeholders. These factors are critical in the process of working with sensitive geographic data in an ethical fashion and ensuring maximum data reliability. Throughout each of these areas, the role of the ethical researcher stretches beyond academic research to accountability beyond academic research to accountability to participants in the form of tangible benefits.",1,,100003,,Internet privacy; Sociology; Data management; Accountability; Data reliability; Hate crime; Reporting system; Volunteered geographic information; Crowdsourcing; General partnership,,,,iNterdisciplinary Exchange for Utah Science,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666378320300039,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.diggeo.2020.100003,10.1016/j.diggeo.2020.100003,3080209416,,0,003-254-479-923-236; 007-244-943-541-458; 011-318-920-577-275; 014-795-884-211-153; 018-402-469-669-090; 020-470-051-122-369; 022-334-695-887-304; 025-174-111-458-629; 027-075-175-941-491; 030-744-145-696-812; 036-047-183-493-869; 036-756-289-435-044; 040-988-373-872-236; 051-444-870-982-237; 052-928-861-530-295; 057-545-918-303-995; 058-051-811-413-234; 066-101-498-522-68X; 071-371-829-127-563; 075-594-557-444-357; 084-101-917-505-669; 088-577-971-264-076; 090-260-667-691-07X; 090-930-662-655-184; 100-129-260-634-476; 102-035-227-101-921; 102-740-613-539-001; 104-622-230-457-039; 110-942-228-120-867; 126-300-090-596-956; 134-745-439-321-624; 135-360-535-210-851; 141-404-322-947-920; 141-847-728-874-517; 150-091-478-250-187; 182-860-695-091-455; 184-362-815-188-229; 185-050-085-375-156; 186-522-757-187-166; 193-840-712-988-426,1,,(magid) 3080209416; (doi) 10.1016/j.diggeo.2020.100003,en

While scientific outcomes of such programs may in the long run improve the state of biodiversity by informing environmental policies, direct benefits to biodiversity could arise locally if such experience of nature leads to biodiversity-friendly behaviors in volunteers. However, whether engagement into nature-based CS programs promotes individual behavioral changes remains poorly known. Here, we explored whether sustained participation in a nature-based citizen science program, called the French Butterfly citizen science project, is associated with changes in individual gardening practices. Specifically, using information provided by volunteers (n = 2362, from 2006 to 2013), we quantified gardening practices that directly affect butterflies, through two different indices: provision of nectar resources, and pesticide use. We found quantitative evidence that individual gardening practices shifted with multi-year participation, towards increased provision of nectar resources and decreased use of pesticides. However, the reduction in pesticide use was weakened if the backyard was used to grow fruits or vegetables. Other variables such as the size of the backyard affected gardening practices. This study reveals that participation in a nature-based citizen science program can prompt biodiversity-friendly behaviors, and highlights citizen science not only as a way to collect ecologically sound data but also as a direct conservation tool. Yet, future interdisciplinary research remains critical to overcome factors limiting firm adoption of pro-biodiversity behaviors.",716,,136842,,Biodiversity; Limiting; Citizen science; Geography; Butterfly; Qualitative evidence; Pesticide use; Environmental planning,Citizen scientists; Lepidoptera; Nature-based monitoring program; Pro-environmental behaviors; Urban green spaces,Animals; Biodiversity; Butterflies; Gardening; Humans; Surveys and Questionnaires; Volunteers,,BIOVEINS; VGI4BIO,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720303521 https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02553145/document https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/INRIA/hal-02553145v1 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32024588 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720303521 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ScTEn.716m6842D/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.136842,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.136842,3003751464,,0,000-447-621-841-939; 000-826-091-294-906; 002-559-793-936-378; 003-201-959-470-572; 007-280-299-198-22X; 008-381-073-052-155; 009-299-623-546-736; 011-306-542-241-724; 013-135-664-578-746; 013-840-287-167-872; 015-010-522-633-758; 015-282-052-274-306; 017-023-984-917-785; 018-934-506-317-682; 019-305-248-387-868; 022-555-928-340-588; 024-723-379-221-772; 024-826-517-020-680; 026-909-838-888-452; 028-133-519-586-358; 028-704-249-623-53X; 029-803-923-352-103; 029-811-396-359-96X; 033-315-971-918-089; 040-620-879-643-46X; 041-487-166-156-166; 041-619-370-947-493; 043-708-313-708-311; 044-760-385-194-641; 046-584-538-151-793; 048-972-955-061-964; 050-493-943-332-513; 051-642-929-821-815; 051-936-810-870-170; 052-097-554-631-446; 062-042-832-449-869; 063-979-754-003-94X; 065-041-501-903-654; 078-022-452-337-913; 078-028-201-407-689; 082-068-003-678-745; 083-848-418-376-777; 085-509-503-021-74X; 096-822-037-963-51X; 101-648-017-007-967; 104-691-406-436-776; 111-349-187-251-084; 113-461-043-403-678; 114-953-794-970-689; 125-976-140-751-605; 128-999-867-360-585; 150-325-162-873-23X; 150-448-842-454-83X; 155-350-540-773-049; 161-969-076-627-262; 163-831-774-639-35X; 164-492-782-813-402; 167-275-555-617-549,5,,(pmid) 32024588; (magid) 3003751464; (pii) s0048-9697(20)30352-1; (doi) 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.136842,en

Volunteer geographical information (VGI) either in the context of citizen science, active crowdsourcing and even passive crowdsourcing has been proven useful in various societal domains such as natural hazards, health status, disease epidemic and biological monitoring. Nonetheless, the variable degrees or unknown quality due to the crowdsourcing settings are still an obstacle for fully integrating these data sources in environmental studies and potentially in policy making. The data curation process in which a quality assurance (QA) is needed is often driven by the direct usability of the data collected within a data conflation process or data fusion (DCDF) combining the crowdsourced data into one view using potentially other data sources as well. Using two examples, namely land cover validation and inundation extent estimation, this paper discusses the close links between QA and DCDF in order to determine whether a disentanglement can be beneficial or not to a better understanding of the data curation process and to its methodology with respect to crowdsourcing data. Far from rejecting the usability quality criterion, the paper advocates for a decoupling of the QA process and the DCDF step as much as possible but still in integrating them within an approach analogous to a Bayesian paradigm.;                     </jats:p>",II-3/W5,,195,202,Conflation; Usability; Citizen science; Data quality; Data science; Sensor fusion; Computer science; Volunteered geographic information; Crowdsourcing; Data curation,,,,,http://www.isprs-ann-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/II-3-W5/195/2015/isprsannals-II-3-W5-195-2015.pdf https://noa.gwlb.de/receive/cop_mods_00015596 https://doaj.org/article/9aae92205f2f4b50b511a5e6a81ae803 http://www.isprs-ann-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/II-3-W5/195/2015/,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/isprsannals-ii-3-w5-195-2015,10.5194/isprsannals-ii-3-w5-195-2015,2278553635,,0,,7,,(doi) 10.5194/isprsannals-ii-3-w5-195-2015; (coreid) 91812121; (magid) 2278553635,en
004-182-191-175-271,The sensitivity of Schistosoma japonicum to praziquantel: a field evaluation in areas with low endemicity of China.,2012-05-01,2012,journal article,The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,14761645; 00029637,American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene,United States,Wei Wang; Jianrong Dai; Hong-Jun Li; Xue-Hui Shen; You-Sheng Liang,"Human infection by the blood-fluke Schistosoma japonicum remains a major public health concern in the People's Republic of China, the Philippines, and parts of Indonesia.1 In China, concerted control efforts since the 1950s have dramatically reduced the number of the areas endemic for the parasite and the burden of disease among humans.2,3 Nevertheless, in the remaining core endemic regions, mainly located along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and some mountainous areas of provinces of Yunnan and Sichuan, over 0.7 million people are estimated to be infected, with a further 30 million at risk of infection.4; ; Because of high efficacy, excellent tolerance, few and transient side effects, simple administration, and competitive cost, praziquantel is currently the drug of choice for treatment of human schistosomiases.5 Treatment of schistosomiasis japonica has shown great advances with the introduction of the drug into the therapeutic arsenal in China,6 and praziquantel-based chemotherapy was considered as a priority control strategy for the national schistosomiasis control program.7 Under laboratory conditions it is possible to induce resistance of Schistosoma mansoni and S. japonicum to praziquantel in mice following treatment with multiple subcurative doses of the drug,8,9 and a decreased sensitivity to praziquantel in field isolates of S. mansoni has also been found in many endemic foci.10–13 In addition, there are several schistosomiasis cases caused by infections with S. haematobium in which repeated standard treatment failed to clear the infection.14,15 Extensive, long-term, repeated praziquantel chemotherapy has been used to control the morbidity and reduce the prevalence and intensity of S. japonicum infection for about 30 years7; it is, therefore, of great importance to monitor the current efficacy of praziquantel in areas where the drug is widely used because there is concern that continued use of praziquantel may result in drug resistance in schistosomes, and there are currently few other drugs being developed that are likely to be alternatives to praziquantel. Previously, there were several studies reporting the sensitivity of praziquantel in areas with moderate or high endemicity.16–18 However, the majority of schistosome-endemic areas in China are currently characterized by a low endemicity, which is mainly caused by praziquantel-based comprehensive control.19,20 Given that many populations in these areas received praziquantel for treatment or prevention of S. japonicum infection many times, it is essential to investigate the susceptibility of S. japonicum to praziquantel in low endemic areas. Here, a field investigation was carried out in two foci with low endemicity in China, to evaluate the current efficacy of praziquantel against S. japonicum.; ; Two villages that are endemic for S. japonicum, namely Xuguang and Sanshan villages located in Dantu District of Zhenjiang City and Jiangpu District of Nanjing City, Jiangsu Province, were involved in this study, with populations of 1,045 and 1,152, and 2.7% and 1.9% of the people infected, respectively (local epidemiological data in 2006). The praziquantel-based integrated control program, including mass synchronous chemotherapy for both humans and domestic animals (mainly bovine) with praziquantel, control of the snail host of S. japonicum, health education, etc., has been successively implemented in both villages for more than 10 years with the World Bank Loan Project for Schistosomiasis Control.21 During the period of schistosomiasis non-transmission (from November 2007 to February, 2008), a random sample of 1,242 volunteers 6–70 years of age from the two study villages was included in this study, however pregnant women were excluded. Schistosoma japonicum infection was detected by parasitological stool examinations using the miracidium hatching test,22 and the total number of eggs detected in each stool specimen (about 30 g) was counted and recorded, and the intensity of infection was expressed as the number of eggs per gram of feces. Epidemiological case surveys were conducted in those subjects with positive stool examinations, to obtain information including name, age, sex, history of treatment of schistosomiasis, etc. Praziquantel tablets (Nanjing Pharmaceutical Factory Co. Ltd, Nanjing, China; batch no. 20070607) were given to those subjects whose fecal examinations were positive at a single oral dose of 40 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg for two successive days recommended by the Ministry of Health, China. Fecal samples were collected for parasitological stool examinations 6 weeks post-treatment.; ; This study was approved by the Ethics Review Committees of Jiangsu Provincial Department of Health and Jiangsu Institute of Parasitic Diseases. Informed consents were obtained from all participants following a detailed description of the purpose and potential benefits of the current study. Praziquantel (oral dose of 40 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg) was offered to those cases with stool eggs for free, and all subjects accepted the treatment protocol.; ; Of the 1,242 residents examined in both villages, 43 had S. japonicum eggs in the first stool examination, with a prevalence rate of 3.46%. The infection rate, age range, sex ratio, intensity of infection, history of infection, history of treatment with praziquantel, and treatment interval of the infected patients are shown in Table 1. Among the 43 infected subjects, 13 received praziquantel treatment at a single dose of 40 mg/kg, and 30 were treated with praziquantel at a dose of 30 mg/kg for two successive days. Six weeks after treatment, all of the treated villagers were re-examined and no S. japonicum eggs were detected.; ; ; ; Table 1; ; Demographical features of the detected schistosomiasis patients in the two study villages; ; ; ; Since praziquantel, a highly effective and safe anti-schistosomal drug, was developed,23 it has replaced all other schistosomicidal agents to become the only anti-schistosomal drug of choice for treatment against all the major species of schistosome.5 Praziquantel makes mass chemotherapy possible as a priority control strategy in almost all countries worldwide where schistosomiasis is endemic.5; ; Diagnosis is central to schistosomiasis control.24 Currently, definitive diagnosis of S. japonicum infection still requires the demonstration of eggs or miracidia in feces,25,26 either by means of the Kato-Katz technique27 or the miracidium hatching method.21 It has been shown that the routine Kato-Katz technique underestimates the real prevalence of S. japonicum in areas with low endemicity.28 Therefore, the miracidium hatching test was used for detection of S. japonicum infection in this study. However, considering the result of the hatching test depends on environmental factors such as temperature and water quality,29 a failure to detect S. japonicum-infected residents cannot be excluded.; ; Our findings indicate that the current efficacy of praziquantel against S. japonicum seems satisfactory and has not changed after about three decades of repeated, long-term extensive use in the low endemic areas of China. Together with our previous findings,17 it seems that the susceptibility of S. japonicum to praziquantel remains high in China. Therefore, periodical monitoring of the efficacy of the drug against schistosomes and systematic survey of praziquantel sensitivity in different geographical isolates of S. japonicum in China are required, and development of tools that can be used for field surveillance of drug resistance in S. japonicum in China seems justified.",86,5,834,836,Drug resistance; Prevalence; Eggs per gram; Schistosomiasis; Schistosoma mansoni; Schistosoma japonicum; Praziquantel; Schistosoma Japonicum Infection; Veterinary medicine; Biology,,Adolescent; Adult; Animals; Child; China/epidemiology; Drug Evaluation/methods; Feces/parasitology; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Praziquantel/therapeutic use; Prevalence; Schistosoma japonicum/drug effects; Schistosomiasis japonica/drug therapy; Schistosomicides/therapeutic use; Young Adult,Schistosomicides; Praziquantel,,https://paperity.org/p/43954737/the-sensitivity-of-schistosoma-japonicum-to-praziquantel-a-field-evaluation-in-areas-with http://www.ajtmh.org/content/journals/10.4269/ajtmh.2012.11-0701 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3335689/ http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3335689,http://dx.doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.2012.11-0701,10.4269/ajtmh.2012.11-0701,2115186330,PMC3335689,0,000-418-011-429-039; 004-336-099-784-890; 006-723-870-838-331; 007-948-532-189-731; 009-602-783-815-009; 010-000-009-530-175; 010-076-332-371-857; 010-371-731-398-522; 016-528-932-522-930; 017-694-023-801-588; 019-987-273-463-413; 028-472-543-519-987; 035-735-906-141-692; 036-938-795-372-311; 037-139-758-642-744; 044-592-316-156-49X; 045-885-661-928-142; 055-335-907-791-630; 055-594-400-842-765; 063-053-096-306-383; 065-420-209-976-135; 067-755-023-965-021; 068-313-082-008-967; 069-752-832-675-277; 093-030-347-252-823; 096-458-562-684-537; 099-597-875-365-229; 112-993-647-843-122; 149-091-016-709-955; 154-435-759-906-789; 189-258-532-428-052; 191-750-719-890-657,16,"research support, non-u.s. gov't",(magid) 2115186330; (doi) 10.4269/ajtmh.2012.11-0701; (pii) 86/5/834; (pmcid) pmc3335689; (pmid) 22556083,en

The Billboard Map website was designed to help the city regulate signage. The Los Angeles landscape is thick with advertising, and the city efforts to count total of signs has been stymied by litigation and political pressure. Because outdoor advertising is designed to be seen, the community collectively knows how many and where signs exist. As such, outdoor advertising is a perfect subject for VGI. This paper analyzes the Los Angeles community's entries in the Billboard Map website both quantitatively and qualitatively. I find that members of the public are well able to map outdoor advertisements, successfully employing the Google Street View interface to pinpoint sign locations. However, the community proved unaware of the regulatory distinctions between types of signs, mapping many more signs than those the city technically designates as billboards. Though these findings might suggest spatial data quality issues in the use of VGI for municipal record-keeping, I argue that the Billboard Map teaches an important lesson about how the public's conceptualization of the urban landscape differs from that envisioned by city planners. In particular, I argue that community members see the landscape of advertising holistically, while city agents treat the landscape as a collection of individual categories. This is important because, while Los Angeles recently banned new off-site signs, it continues to approve similar signs under new planning categories, with more in the works.</jats:p>",1,2,75,87,The Internet; Advertising; Signage; Geography; Spatial data quality; Urban planning; Volunteered geographic information; Conceptualization; Categorization; Politics,,,,,https://www.cogitatiopress.com/urbanplanning/article/view/608/608 https://ideas.repec.org/a/cog/urbpla/v1y2016i2p75-87.html https://core.ac.uk/display/143831988 https://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/handle/document/54313 https://www.cogitatiopress.com/urbanplanning/article/download/608/608,http://dx.doi.org/10.17645/up.v1i2.608,10.17645/up.v1i2.608,2469569567,,0,004-445-599-749-605; 004-803-133-789-127; 006-696-584-226-114; 007-680-834-744-185; 014-818-480-999-908; 020-619-269-505-963; 026-553-040-934-312; 027-893-674-535-943; 030-217-575-405-566; 038-976-596-179-447; 041-506-590-074-021; 047-100-212-874-054; 049-912-400-079-636; 057-357-333-577-597; 061-517-241-876-498; 065-459-044-620-357; 066-101-498-522-68X; 069-566-524-554-386; 071-490-604-491-921; 072-239-178-756-507; 082-488-337-485-557; 085-672-397-511-824; 088-339-711-439-200; 090-166-306-048-504; 102-160-469-693-977; 103-664-937-881-203; 104-127-606-020-305; 109-987-635-819-724; 126-648-069-884-299; 129-793-162-209-757; 133-982-146-986-73X; 138-598-676-015-32X; 145-533-996-473-043; 146-857-588-283-096; 147-539-342-970-008; 148-615-143-308-423; 169-631-229-022-559; 195-019-623-135-107,1,,(doi) 10.17645/up.v1i2.608; (magid) 2469569567,en

005-451-118-125-226,"Lists, Spatial Practice and Assistive Technologies for the Blind",2012-10-12,2012,journal article,M/C Journal,14412616,Queensland University of Technology,,Suneel Jethani,"<jats:p>IntroductionSupermarkets are functionally challenging environments for people with vision impairments. A supermarket is likely to house an average of 45,000 products in a median floor-space of 4,529 square meters and many visually impaired people are unable to shop without assistance, which greatly impedes personal independence (Nicholson et al.). The task of selecting goods in a supermarket is an “activity that is expressive of agency, identity and creativity” (Sutherland) from which many vision-impaired persons are excluded. In response to this, a number of proof of concept (demonstrating feasibility) and prototype assistive technologies are being developed which aim to use smart phones as potential sensorial aides for vision impaired persons. In this paper, I discuss two such prototypic technologies, Shop Talk and BlindShopping. I engage with this issue’s list theme by suggesting that, on the one hand, list making is a uniquely human activity that demonstrates our need for order, reliance on memory, reveals our idiosyncrasies, and provides insights into our private lives (Keaggy 12). On the other hand, lists feature in the creation of spatial inventories that represent physical environments (Perec 3-4, 9-10). The use of lists in the architecture of assistive technologies for shopping illuminates the interaction between these two modalities of list use where items contained in a list are not only textual but also cartographic elements that link the material and immaterial in space and time (Haber 63). I argue that despite the emancipatory potential of assistive shopping technologies, their efficacy in practical situations is highly dependent on the extent to which they can integrate a number of lists to produce representations of space that are meaningful for vision impaired users. I suggest that the extent to which these prototypes may translate to becoming commercially viable, widely adopted technologies is heavily reliant upon commercial and institutional infrastructures, data sources, and regulation. Thus, their design, manufacture and adoption-potential are shaped by the extent to which certain data inventories are accessible and made interoperable. To overcome such constraints, it is important to better understand the “spatial syntax” associated with the shopping task for a vision impaired person; that is, the connected ordering of real and virtual spatial elements that result in a supermarket as a knowable space within which an assisted “spatial practice” of shopping can occur (Kellerman 148, Lefebvre 16).In what follows, I use the concept of lists to discuss the production of supermarket-space in relation to the enabling and disabling potentials of assistive technologies. First, I discuss mobile digital technologies relative to disability and impairment and describe how the shopping task produces a disabling spatial practice. Second, I present a case study showing how assistive technologies function in aiding vision impaired users in completing the task of supermarket shopping. Third, I discuss various factors that may inhibit the liberating potential of technology assisted shopping by vision-impaired people. Addressing Shopping as a Disabling Spatial Practice Consider how a shopping list might inform one’s experience of supermarket space. The way shopping lists are written demonstrate the variability in the logic that governs list writing. As Bill Keaggy demonstrates in his found shopping list Web project and subsequent book, Milk, Eggs, Vodka, a shopping list may be written on a variety of materials, be arranged in a number of orientations, and the writer may use differing textual attributes, such as size or underlining to show emphasis. The writer may use longhand, abbreviate, write neatly, scribble, and use an array of alternate spelling and naming conventions. For example, items may be listed based on knowledge of the location of products, they may be arranged on a list as a result of an inventory of a pantry or fridge, or they may be copied in the order they appear in a recipe. Whilst shopping, some may follow strictly the order of their list, crossing back and forth between aisles. Some may work through their list item-by-item, perhaps forward scanning to achieve greater economies of time and space. As a person shops, their memory may be stimulated by visual cues reminding them of products they need that may not be included on their list.  For the vision impaired, this task is near impossible to complete without the assistance of a relative, friend, agency volunteer, or store employee. Such forms of assistance are often unsatisfactory, as delays may be caused due to the unavailability of an assistant, or the assistant having limited literacy, knowledge, or patience to adequately meet the shopper’s needs. Home delivery services, though readily available, impede personal independence (Nicholson et al.). Katie Ellis and Mike Kent argue that “an impairment becomes a disability due to the impact of prevailing ableist social structures” (3). It can be said, then, that supermarkets function as a disability producing space for the vision impaired shopper. For the vision impaired, a supermarket is a “hegemonic modern visual infrastructure” where, for example, merchandisers may reposition items regularly to induce customers to explore areas of the shop that they wouldn’t usually, a move which adds to the difficulty faced by those customers with impaired vision who work on the assumption that items remain as they usually are (Schillmeier 161).In addressing this issue, much emphasis has been placed on the potential of mobile communications technologies in affording vision impaired users greater mobility and flexibility (Jolley 27). However, as Gerard Goggin argues, the adoption of mobile communication technologies has not necessarily “gone hand in hand with new personal and collective possibilities” given the limited access to standard features, even if the device is text-to-speech enabled (98). Issues with Digital Rights Management (DRM) limit the way a device accesses and reproduces information, and confusion over whether audio rights are needed to convert text-to-speech, impede the accessibility of mobile communications technologies for vision impaired users (Ellis and Kent 136). Accessibility and functionality issues like these arise out of the needs, desires, and expectations of the visually impaired as a user group being considered as an afterthought as opposed to a significant factor in the early phases of design and prototyping (Goggin 89). Thus, the development of assistive technologies for the vision impaired has been left to third parties who must adopt their solutions to fit within certain technical parameters. It is valuable to consider what is involved in the task of shopping in order to appreciate the considerations that must be made in the design of shopping intended assistive technologies. Shopping generally consists of five sub-tasks: travelling to the store; finding items in-store; paying for and bagging items at the register; exiting the store and getting home; and, the often overlooked task of putting items away once at home. In this process supermarkets exhibit a “trichotomous spatial ontology” consisting of locomotor space that a shopper moves around the store, haptic space in the immediate vicinity of the shopper, and search space where individual products are located (Nicholson et al.). In completing these tasks, a shopper will constantly be moving through and switching between all three of these spaces. In the next section I examine how assistive technologies function in producing supermarkets as both enabling and disabling spaces for the vision impaired. Assistive Technologies for Vision Impaired ShoppersJason Farman (43) and Adriana de Douza e Silva both argue that in many ways spaces have always acted as information interfaces where data of all types can reside. Global Positioning System (GPS), Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), and Quick Response (QR) codes all allow for practically every spatial encounter to be an encounter with information. Site-specific and location-aware technologies address the desire for meaningful representations of space for use in everyday situations by the vision impaired. Further, the possibility of an “always-on” connection to spatial information via a mobile phone with WiFi or 3G connections transforms spatial experience by “enfolding remote [and latent] contexts inside the present context” (de Souza e Silva). A range of GPS navigation systems adapted for vision-impaired users are currently on the market. Typically, these systems convert GPS information into text-to-speech instructions and are either standalone devices, such as the Trekker Breeze, or they use the compass, accelerometer, and 3G or WiFi functions found on most smart phones, such as Loadstone. Whilst both these products are adequate in guiding a vision-impaired user from their home to a supermarket, there are significant differences in their interfaces and data architectures. Trekker Breeze is a standalone hardware device that produces talking menus, maps, and GPS information. While its navigation functionality relies on a worldwide radio-navigation system that uses a constellation of 24 satellites to triangulate one’s position (May and LaPierre 263-64), its map and text-to-speech functionality relies on data on a DVD provided with the unit. Loadstone is an open source software system for Nokia devices that has been developed within the vision-impaired community. Loadstone is built on GNU General Public License (GPL) software and is developed from private and user based funding; this overcomes the issue of Trekker Breeze’s reliance on trading policies and pricing models of the few global vendors of satellite navigation data. Both products have significant shortcomings if viewed in the broader context of the five sub-tasks involved in shopping described above. Trekker Breeze and Loadstone require that additional devices be connected to it. In the case of Trekker Breeze it is a tactile keypad, and with Loadstone it is an aftermarket screen reader. To function optimally, Trekker Breeze requires that routes be pre-recorded and, according to a review conducted by the American Foundation for the Blind, it requires a 30-minute warm up time to properly orient itself. Both Trekker Breeze and Loadstone allow users to create and share Points of Interest (POI) databases showing the location of various places along a given route. Non-standard or duplicated user generated content in POI databases may, however, have a negative effect on usability (Ellis and Kent 2). Furthermore, GPS-based navigation systems are accurate to approximately ten metres, which means that users must rely on their own mobility skills when they are required to change direction or stop for traffic. This issue with GPS accuracy is more pronounced when a vision-impaired user is approaching a supermarket where they are likely to encounter environmental hazards with greater frequency and both pedestrian and vehicular traffic in greater density. Here the relations between space defined and spaces poorly defined or undefined by the GPS device interact to produce the supermarket surrounds as a disabling space (Galloway). Prototype Systems for Supermarket Navigation and Product SelectionIn the discussion to follow, I look at two prototype systems using QR codes and RFID that are designed to be used in-store by vision-impaired shoppers. Shop Talk is a proof of concept system developed by researchers at Utah State University that uses synthetic verbal route directions to assist vision impaired shoppers with supermarket navigation, product search, and selection (Nicholson et al.). Its hardware consists of a portable computational unit, a numeric keypad, a wireless barcode scanner and base station, headphones for the user to receive the synthetic speech instructions, a USB hub to connect all the components, and a backpack to carry them (with the exception of the barcode scanner) which has been slightly modified with a plastic stabiliser to assist in correct positioning. Shop Talk represents the supermarket environment using two data structures. The first is comprised of two elements: a topological map of locomotor space that allows for directional labels of “left,” “right,” and “forward,” to be added to the supermarket floor plan; and, for navigation of haptic space, the supermarket inventory management system, which is used to create verbal descriptions of product information. The second data structure is a Barcode Connectivity Matrix (BCM), which associates each shelf barcode with several pieces of information such as aisle, aisle side, section, shelf, position, Universal Product Code (UPC) barcode, product description, and price. Nicholson et al. suggest that one of their “most immediate objectives for future work is to migrate the system to a more conventional mobile platform” such as a smart phone (see Mobile Shopping). The Personalisable Interactions with Resources on AMI-Enabled Mobile Dynamic Environments (PRIAmIDE) research group at the University of Deusto is also approaching Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) by exploring the smart phone’s sensing, communication, computing, and storage potential. As part of their work, the prototype system, BlindShopping, was developed to address the issue of assisted shopping using entirely off-the-shelf technology with minimal environmental adjustments to navigate the store and search, browse and select products (López-de-Ipiña et al. 34). Blind Shopping’s architecture is based on three components. Firstly, a navigation system provides the user with synthetic verbal instructions to users via headphones connected to the smart phone device being used in order to guide them around the store. This requires a RFID reader to be attached to the tip of the user’s white cane and road-marking-like RFID tag lines to be distributed throughout the aisles. A smartphone application processes the RFID data that is received by the smart phone via Bluetooth generating the verbal navigation commands as a result. Products are recognised by pointing a QR code reader enabled smart phone at an embossed code located on a shelf. The system is managed by a Rich Internet Application (RIA) interface, which operates by Web browser, and is used to register the RFID tags situated in the aisles and the QR codes located on shelves (López-de-Ipiña and  37-38). A typical use-scenario for Blind Shopping involves a user activating the system by tracing an “L” on the screen or issuing the “Location” voice command, which activates the supermarket navigation system which then asks the user to either touch an RFID floor marking with their cane or scan a QR code on a nearby shelf to orient the system. The application then asks the user to dictate the product or category of product that they wish to locate. The smart phone maintains a continuous Bluetooth connection with the RFID reader to keep track of user location at all times. By drawing a “P” or issuing the “Product” voice command, a user can switch the device into product recognition mode where the smart phone camera is pointed at an embossed QR code on a shelf to retrieve information about a product such as manufacturer, name, weight, and price, via synthetic speech (López-de-Ipiña et al. 38-39). Despite both systems aiming to operate with as little environmental adjustment as possible, as well as minimise the extent to which a supermarket would need to allocate infrastructural, administrative, and human resources to implementing assistive technologies for vision impaired shoppers, there will undoubtedly be significant establishment and maintenance costs associated with the adoption of production versions of systems resembling either prototype described in this paper. As both systems rely on data obtained from a server by invoking Web services, supermarkets would need to provide in-store WiFi. Further, both systems’ dependence on store inventory data would mean that commercial versions of either of these systems are likely to be supermarket specific or exclusive given that there will be policies in place that forbid access to inventory systems, which contain pricing information to third parties. Secondly, an assumption in the design of both prototypes is that the shopping task ends with the user arriving at home; this overlooks the important task of being able to recognise products in order to put them away or to use at a later time.The BCM and QR product recognition components of both respective prototypic systems associates information to products in order to assist users in the product search and selection sub-tasks. However, information such as use-by dates, discount offers, country of manufacture, country of manufacturer’s origin, nutritional information, and the labelling of products as Halal, Kosher, containing alcohol, nuts, gluten, lactose, phenylalanine, and so on, create further challenges in how different data sources are managed within the devices’ software architecture. The reliance of both systems on existing smartphone technology is also problematic. Changes in the production and uptake of mobile communication devices, and the software that they operate on, occurs rapidly. Once the fit-out of a retail space with the necessary instrumentation in order to accommodate a particular system has occurred, this system is unlikely to be able to cater to the requirement for frequent upgrades, as built environments are less flexible in the upgrading of their technological infrastructure (Kellerman 148). This sets up a scenario where the supermarket may persist as a disabling space due to a gap between the functional capacities of applications designed for mobile communication devices and the environments in which they are to be used. Lists and Disabling Spatial PracticeThe development and provision of access to assistive technologies and the data they rely upon is a commercial issue (Ellis and Kent 7). The use of assistive technologies in supermarket-spaces that rely on the inter-functional coordination of multiple inventories may have the unintended effect of excluding people with disabilities from access to legitimate content (Ellis and Kent 7). With de Certeau, we can ask of supermarket-space “What spatial practices correspond, in the area where discipline is manipulated, to these apparatuses that produce a disciplinary space?"" (96).In designing assistive technologies, such as those discussed in this paper, developers must strive to achieve integration across multiple data inventories. Software architectures must be optimised to overcome issues relating to intellectual property, cross platform access, standardisation, fidelity, potential duplication, and mass-storage. This need for “cross sectioning,” however, “merely adds to the muddle” (Lefebvre 8). This is a predicament that only intensifies as space and objects in space become increasingly “representable” (Galloway), and as the impetus for the project of spatial politics for the vision impaired moves beyond representation to centre on access and meaning-making.ConclusionSupermarkets act as sites of hegemony, resistance, difference, and transformation, where the vision impaired and their allies resist the “repressive socialization of impaired bodies” through their own social movements relating to environmental accessibility and the technology assisted spatial practice of shopping (Gleeson 129). It is undeniable that the prototype technologies described in this paper, and those like it, indeed do have a great deal of emancipatory potential. However, it should be understood that these devices produce representations of supermarket-space as a simulation within a framework that attempts to mimic the real, and these representations are pre-determined by the industrial, technological, and regulatory forces that govern their production (Lefebvre 8). Thus, the potential of assistive technologies is dependent upon a range of constraints relating to data accessibility, and the interaction of various kinds of lists across the geographic area that surrounds the supermarket, locomotor, haptic, and search spaces of the supermarket, the home-space, and the internal spaces of a shopper’s imaginary. These interactions are important in contributing to the reproduction of disability in supermarkets through the use of assistive shopping technologies. The ways by which people make and read shopping lists complicate the relations between supermarket-space as location data and product inventories versus that which is intuited and experienced by a shopper (Sutherland). Not only should we be creating inventories of supermarket locomotor, haptic, and search spaces, the attention of developers working in this area of assistive technologies should look beyond the challenges of spatial representation and move towards a focus on issues of interoperability and expanded access of spatial inventory databases and data within and beyond supermarket-space.ReferencesDe Certeau, Michel.

Triggered by several recent kindergarten abuse claims, China is aiming to reduce the occurrence of such cases in an effective way. From a lifecourse epidemiological perspective, such abuse experiences in the early life can jeopardize children's behavior, physical and especially mental health in adulthood (1–5). There are a total estimation of 239 thousand kindergartens and 82 million population aged 0–4 in China by 2016 (6, 7). Therefore, such a nationwide inspection could be considered a large-scale public health intervention program. These recent abuse cases, found out accidentally by parents at home, imply that an unknown number of adolescent and adult mental (sometimes physical) health issues may stem from what has happened but been unseen or intentionally kept hidden in kindergarten, with suspicions that during that period children were under duress and hence not capable of proper and adequate communication about abuse issues with their guardians in kindergarten.",6,,236,,Epidemiology; Mental health; Public health; Psychology; China; Notice; Population; Child abuse; Family medicine; Volunteered geographic information,child abuse; child health; crowdsourcing science; geographic information systems; interactive questionnaire; kindergartener; volunteered geographic information,,,China Medical Board; Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek; Koninklijke Nederlandse Akademie van Wetenschappen,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30211147/ https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2018.00236/full https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30211147 https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpubh.2018.00236/full https://research.utwente.nl/en/publications/integrating-kindergartener-specific-questionnaires-with-citizen-s https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Aris.utwente.nl%3Apublications%2F6feb8ceb-1b96-4bee-a5f0-7e5ca780d442,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2018.00236,10.3389/fpubh.2018.00236,2888869021,PMC6121954,0,004-670-292-853-943; 013-911-023-490-815; 016-795-144-813-047; 022-323-591-762-343; 024-070-185-082-406; 029-607-858-240-755; 037-944-715-554-631; 042-203-819-324-462; 045-818-651-200-924; 051-063-515-173-241; 057-266-979-164-982; 057-545-918-303-995; 067-768-752-070-247; 069-646-286-645-96X; 100-108-089-039-964; 109-737-571-933-357; 111-097-305-775-586; 121-495-928-137-667,14,,(pmid) 30211147; (doi) 10.3389/fpubh.2018.00236; (magid) 2888869021; (pmcid) pmc6121954,en

As one approach to VGI, location-based games (LBGs) have been shown to be successful in motivating non-expert users to collect and tag geospatial data. However, the central VGI problem of data quality has so far not been solved satisfyingly. Previous studies show that games that reward their players for in- or post-game data reviewing can assure only a validation rate of about 40% of the data. We address this problem with a new LBG design pattern, based on game rules that encourage players to take the decisions of others into account while making their data collecting decisions. We empirically evaluate the new pattern by comparing the positional accuracy of data collected with two different rule sets for the LBG GeoSnake. Our pattern is shown to result in a significant accuracy improvement.",,,331,336,World Wide Web; Design pattern; Data quality; Data science; Computer science; Geographic information system; Outsourcing; Game design; Volunteered geographic information; Crowdsourcing; Geospatial analysis,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/144493080 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-24500-8_36 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-24500-8_36 https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2176629 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/iwec/icec2011.html#MatyasKSK11,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-24500-8_36,10.1007/978-3-642-24500-8_36,1536314703,,0,032-440-314-340-754; 048-225-868-795-012; 057-431-859-947-639; 088-779-697-687-61X; 096-606-609-268-410; 109-113-967-386-024; 113-663-971-294-22X; 123-886-781-929-504; 128-843-947-676-730,12,,(magid) 1536314703; (doi) 10.1007/978-3-642-24500-8_36,en

VGI has shifted the ways information is created, shared, used and experienced, with important implications for applications of geospatial data, including emergency management. Detailed interviews with 13 emergency management professionals from eight organisations across five Australian states provided insights into the impacts of VGI on official emergency management. Perceived opportunities presented by VGI included improved communication, acquisition of diverse local information, and increased community engagement in disaster management. Identified challenges included the digital divide, data management, misinformation, and liability concerns. Significantly, VGI disrupts the traditional top-down structure of emergency management and reflects a culture shift away from authoritative control of information. To capitalise on the opportunities of VGI, agencies need to share responsibility and be willing to remain flexible in supporting positive community practises, including VGI. Given the high accountability and inherently responsive nature of decision making in disaster management, it provides a useful lens through which to examine the impacts of VGI on official authoritative systems more broadly. This analysis of the perceptions of emergency management professionals suggests changes to traditional systems that involve decentralisation of power and increased empowerment of citizens, where value is increasingly recognised in both expert and citizen-produced information, initiatives and practises.",57,,189,198,Data management; Digital divide; Empowerment; Geography; Accountability; Community engagement; Public relations; Volunteered geographic information; Emergency management; Geospatial analysis,,,,Commonwealth of Australia,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/urban/urban57.html#Haworth16 https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/emergency-management-perspectives-on-volunteered-geographic-information(038aa6d0-b8dd-432b-86ab-b2d8ca17f717).html https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/publications/emergency-management-perspectives-on-volunteered-geographic-infor https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2016.02.009 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0198971516300175,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2016.02.009,10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2016.02.009,2299072670,,0,000-967-721-739-893; 004-817-546-886-395; 008-206-432-504-435; 008-655-662-451-459; 009-712-132-498-449; 010-833-326-588-000; 011-854-399-312-637; 012-264-554-063-607; 013-830-350-862-327; 016-259-336-413-735; 025-546-677-715-107; 026-645-756-189-301; 030-327-591-017-421; 033-449-826-336-115; 036-300-195-169-528; 036-401-991-781-18X; 040-267-517-107-219; 041-017-063-144-465; 044-556-168-236-763; 045-181-423-237-180; 046-509-496-371-690; 047-833-007-161-424; 048-665-480-711-168; 049-027-113-917-324; 054-511-445-518-675; 054-971-993-855-581; 055-524-866-430-670; 057-545-918-303-995; 063-118-362-653-80X; 063-149-199-202-33X; 064-280-900-843-582; 068-927-620-894-617; 072-243-912-426-29X; 076-062-447-098-982; 077-094-229-175-997; 077-826-390-968-564; 079-150-284-796-055; 081-235-270-322-291; 084-060-612-822-999; 084-374-719-159-703; 090-766-037-404-513; 091-204-512-390-272; 092-987-952-972-399; 097-612-174-011-049; 111-163-933-663-414; 111-901-923-536-480; 123-899-687-687-732; 126-685-621-398-95X; 129-976-442-805-15X; 131-803-513-768-170; 134-585-173-483-481; 138-512-383-696-432; 138-598-676-015-32X; 141-431-711-533-573; 143-380-367-418-298; 154-575-000-528-203; 171-544-875-588-246; 173-936-112-272-804; 178-039-761-156-899; 191-166-633-725-893; 192-720-146-714-750,45,,(magid) 2299072670; (doi) 10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2016.02.009; (coreid) 131341033,en

Schulte,"<jats:p>A Review of:&#x0D;; Williams, Dorothy and Louisa Coles. “Evidence-Based Practice in Teaching: An Information Perspective.” Journal of Documentation 63.6 (2007): 812-35.&#x0D;; &#x0D;; Objective – The objective of the study was to explore how teachers in the United Kingdom use research literature to inform their practice. Special emphasis was given to the effect of the teachers’ information literacy and their level of ready access to research information. &#x0D;; &#x0D;; Design – This study was primarily a qualitative study utilizing mixed methods, including individual interviews, focus groups (“literature review groups”), and an online discussion forum. Qualitative data was supplemented by a questionnaire survey. &#x0D;; &#x0D;; Setting – The qualitative portions of the study took place in the United Kingdom across five education authorities; however, it is unclear where these authorities were geographically. The survey was distributed across Scotland, England, and Wales. The study was conducted during 2002 to 2003. &#x0D;; &#x0D;; Subjects – Nursery, primary, and secondary teachers, school librarians, school library systems, and education authority advisors (EA) in the United Kingdom.&#x0D;; &#x0D;; Methods – The 28 interviews (54% primary teachers, 39% secondary teachers, 7% special education) and four focus groups (each with three to five participants; 15 participants in total, including teachers at various levels from primary, secondary, and nursery schools) were conducted with volunteers from a random sample across five education authorities. Recruitment was done by sending written materials to schools. Those interviewed represented five authorities. Focus groups were conducted in just four authorities. It is not clear when the individual and group interviews were conducted (time of day and year). Volunteers were given the option to receive funding for a substitute teacher in order to participate, though none took advantage of this offer. &#x0D;; &#x0D;; The interview process used a vignette technique to elicit teachers’ attitudes to a situation in a non-threatening way. Interviewees were asked to comment on two situations that might make them seek information. One was adding a new subject or new aspect of an existing subject into the classroom. The second dealt with a “new pedagogical challenge.” Though the topics of the vignettes were provided, the exact way the topics were presented was not. They were asked how they would advise another teacher in these situations then relate their thoughts to a real situation they had faced. Interviews were about one hour in length. Twenty-five of the 28 interviews were taped and transcribed verbatim. Extensive notes were made for the other three. Transcripts and notes were analyzed using QSR N4 Classic content analysis software. Themes related to information literacy and information seeking, including barriers, were noted.&#x0D;; &#x0D;; Four literature response groups were given examples of research information (journal articles, reports, etc) related to information computer technology (ICT) and class size. Each topic had information from various evidence levels and included both print and electronic format. Again, the discussion topics were provided in the article, but the exact way the topics were presented was not. Over 2 to 2.5 hours, teachers read the materials, made notes, and discussed the information as a group. For the ICT information, groups were asked to discuss presentation of the information. For the class size information, groups were asked to discuss content of the materials. Discussions were transcribed verbatim and analyzed with the content analysis software.&#x0D;; &#x0D;; A total of 3899 questionnaire surveys were distributed to teachers (3000), head teachers (500), school librarians (250), education authority advisors (100), and school library systems (49). Response rate was exceptionally low in the teacher and head teacher categories, with only 10.9% of teachers and 15.6% of head teachers responding. Response rates in other categories ranged from 31.2% to 55%, with the highest response rates from education authorities and school library systems.  The survey served to gain an understanding of attitudes about using research in practice across a broad spectrum of stakeholders. The survey instrument itself, which was not provided in the article, was piloted prior to the study, but there is no mention of reliability or validity analysis. &#x0D;; &#x0D;; To supplement study data, participants who had stated they would be interested in participating in an online discussion were sent preliminary findings and asked to comment on themes using the online discussion forum. Only 21 posts were gathered using this method. &#x0D;; &#x0D;; Overall, the methods used in this study are appropriate for the questions that were posed in the article. Qualitative studies are useful for gathering data where little is known and where more data would help identify possibly hypotheses for further study. &#x0D;; &#x0D;; Main Results – Teachers in this study relied on a small set of resources and preferred what was readily available at their own school. These teachers most frequently used colleagues, in-service events, the Internet, newspapers, and reports typically found in schools as sources of information. Sources that information professionals would consider quality evidence were rarely mentioned. These teachers also tended to prefer sources that present information in a practical context. Not surprisingly, time was identified as a major barrier to accessing research information in addition to limited access to resources. The Internet was identified as the preferred point of access, citing ease of use, speed, and convenience as the reasons for this preference. Comments suggested a preference for synthesized information sources. &#x0D;; &#x0D;; Teachers indicated they felt the responsibility for disseminating research information fell on head teachers and EA. They also noted that access to information from their own school library was a problem. They felt librarians and libraries in schools were meant for students, not for teachers, and also expressed that school libraries typically did not provide access to research. Comments suggested that the structure of teaching in a classroom itself does not allow teachers to use information as is needed for evidence-based practice. There were concerns expressed about lack of school library funding available to supply research evidence needed by teachers. &#x0D;; &#x0D;; School librarians and school library services respondents did indicate that they provide a broad range of services aimed at teachers, such as alerts to literature, information skills training, and advice on resources. However, their sources of research for teachers were limited in nature. Librarians indicated that teachers did not ask for research information, but if demand were there, they could respond accordingly. Teacher comments suggest that librarians might want to consider being more proactive in distributing information. &#x0D;; &#x0D;; Though teachers expressed high confidence in their abilities to find information, comments about search habits and practices contradicted this. Most remarks suggested searching techniques that were not sophisticated or showing higher levels of information literacy competency.  The respondents were concerned with evaluating the quality of information sources but found this appraisal to be more difficult if the authors did not explain the impact or change in practice that should come from the findings. &#x0D;; &#x0D;; The participants in this study were likely biased toward using research information more than other teachers. This is an important limitation that the authors do address. Additionally, the response rate for the survey was quite low for the teacher subset. Despite this limitation, data from the questionnaire was used appropriately to confirm and clarify data from the qualitative portions of the study.&#x0D;; &#x0D;; Conclusion – In order for teachers to appreciate the value of quality research evidence enough to regularly seek it out and place it into practice, a culture of evidence based practice must be embraced and supported by their school authorities. This study indicates significant potential for school librarians and systems to support this culture through proactive dissemination of research, provision of local access to materials, and education related to information literacy. School librarians must evolve from their typical student-centric role to accomplish this.</jats:p>",3,4,72,75,Information literacy; Psychology; Qualitative research; Pedagogy; Information seeking; School library; Special education; Information quality; Focus group; Questionnaire,,,,,https://journals.library.ualberta.ca/index.php/EBLIP/article/download/4072/3704 http://ejournals.library.ualberta.ca/index.php/EBLIP/article/view/4072,http://dx.doi.org/10.18438/b8r62d,10.18438/b8r62d,1591288926,,0,,1,,(magid) 1591288926; (doi) 10.18438/b8r62d,en

Salk; Tobias Sturn; Linda See; Steffen Fritz; Christoph Perger,"Volunteered geographic information (VGI) is the assembly of spatial information based on public input. While VGI has proliferated in recent years, assessing the quality of volunteer-contributed data has proven challenging, leading some to question the efficiency of such programs. In this paper, we compare several quality metrics for individual volunteers' contributions. the date were the product of the 'Cropland Capture' game, in which several thousand volunteers assessed 165,000 images for the presence of cropland over the course of 6 months. We compared agreement between volunteer ratings and an image's majority classification with volunteer self-agreement on repeated images and expert evaluations. We also examined the impact of experience and learning on performance. Volunteer self-agreement was nearly always higher than agreement with majority classifications, and much greater than agreement with expert validations although these metrics were all positively correlated. Volunteer quality showed a broad trend toward improvement with experience, but the highest accuracies were achieved by a handful of moderately active contributors, not the most active volunteers. Our results emphasize the importance of a universal set of expert-validated tasks as a gold standard for evaluating VGI quality",9,4,410,426,Spatial analysis; Geography; Data quality; Data science; Volunteer; Volunteered geographic information; Crowdsourcing; Contextual image classification,,,,European Research Council; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis,http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016IJDE....9..410S/abstract https://doi.org/10.1080/17538947.2015.1039609 https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17538947.2015.1039609 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/digearth/digearth9.html#SalkSSFP16 http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/11287/ https://pub.epsilon.slu.se/14273/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17538947.2015.1039609,10.1080/17538947.2015.1039609,1937987873,,0,002-555-907-164-663; 004-858-484-597-475; 005-507-347-603-172; 006-264-648-133-074; 007-857-101-229-718; 009-095-552-623-989; 009-322-051-378-345; 012-033-258-399-378; 017-518-735-691-484; 022-473-450-579-960; 023-290-850-444-285; 026-645-756-189-301; 027-736-997-184-595; 029-340-611-176-878; 033-060-042-560-682; 033-753-266-989-199; 035-153-873-006-303; 038-976-596-179-447; 040-267-517-107-219; 040-321-995-847-777; 045-181-423-237-180; 050-539-693-523-843; 053-620-292-475-147; 057-343-008-020-106; 057-545-918-303-995; 082-027-782-270-43X; 084-374-719-159-703; 085-351-223-134-435; 088-339-711-439-200; 091-879-361-883-787; 093-511-770-405-791; 103-081-387-145-206; 124-133-980-611-291; 136-570-589-999-562; 141-404-322-947-920; 145-879-536-020-092; 147-213-981-170-541; 155-581-609-947-253; 171-544-875-588-246; 179-304-543-978-73X,32,,(magid) 1937987873; (coreid) 95650461; (doi) 10.1080/17538947.2015.1039609,en
006-705-913-521-168,USING OPENSTREETMAP DATA TO GENERATE BUILDING MODELS WITH THEIR INNER STRUCTURES FOR 3D MAPS,2017-09-14,2017,journal article,"ISPRS Annals of Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences",21949050,Copernicus GmbH,,Zhiyong Wang; Alexander Zipf,"Abstract. With the development of Web 2.0, more and more data related to indoor environments has been collected within the volunteered geographic information (VGI) framework, which creates a need for construction of indoor environments from VGI. In this study, we focus on generating 3D building models from OpenStreetMap (OSM) data, and provide an approach to support construction and visualization of indoor environments on 3D maps. In this paper, we present an algorithm which can extract building information from OSM data, and can construct building structures as well as inner building components (e.g., doors, rooms, and windows). A web application is built to support the processing and visualization of the building models on a 3D map. We test our approach with an indoor dataset collected from the field. The results show the feasibility of our approach and its potentials to provide support for a wide range of applications, such as indoor and outdoor navigation, urban planning, and incident management.",IV-2/W4,,411,416,Web application; Doors; 3d building models; Visualization; Computer science; Urban planning; Incident management (ITSM); Volunteered geographic information; Database,,,,,https://www.isprs-ann-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/IV-2-W4/411/2017/isprs-annals-IV-2-W4-411-2017.pdf http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ISPAn42W4..411W/abstract https://noa.gwlb.de/receive/cop_mods_00008804 https://www.isprs-ann-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/IV-2-W4/411/2017/,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/isprs-annals-iv-2-w4-411-2017,10.5194/isprs-annals-iv-2-w4-411-2017,2755828411,,0,005-361-352-361-981; 010-024-340-417-726; 012-012-588-838-414; 015-321-680-169-688; 017-465-705-893-310; 020-132-620-861-048; 021-628-973-952-354; 030-416-570-557-01X; 035-546-458-656-015; 039-008-601-346-536; 057-545-918-303-995; 071-547-407-522-754; 117-293-672-271-44X; 133-529-569-791-605; 139-982-470-639-017; 144-181-346-432-896; 190-216-777-739-959,9,,(coreid) 87772644; (doi) 10.5194/isprs-annals-iv-2-w4-411-2017; (magid) 2755828411,en

Jarvis; Rob Procter,"Increasingly, user generated content (UGC) in social media postings and their associated metadata such as time and location stamps are being used to provide useful operational information during natural hazard events such as hurricanes, storms and floods. The main advantage of these new sources of data are twofold. First, in a purely additive sense, they can provide much denser geographical coverage of the hazard as compared to traditional sensor networks. Second, they provide what physical sensors are not able to do: By documenting personal observations and experiences, they directly record the impact of a hazard on the human environment. For this reason interpretation of the content (e.g., hashtags, images, text, emojis, etc) and metadata (e.g., keywords, tags, geolocation) have been a focus of much research into social media analytics. However, as choices of semantic tags in the current methods are usually reduced to the exact name or type of the event (e.g., hashtags '#Sandy' or '#flooding'), the main limitation of such approaches remains their mere nowcasting capacity. In this study we make use of polysemous tags of images posted during several recent flood events and demonstrate how such volunteered geographic data can be used to provide early warning of an event before its outbreak.",12,2,e0172870,,User-generated content; Geolocation; Data science; Social media analytics; Warning system; Natural hazard; Computer science; Social media; Semantic HTML; Metadata,,Cyclonic Storms; Data Collection; Disaster Planning; Disasters; Environmental Monitoring/methods; Floods; Geography; Humans; Internet; Photography; Risk Assessment/methods; Social Media,,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council,https://core.ac.uk/display/78652360 https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0172870 http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/86185/ https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0172870 https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0172870&type=printable https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28235035 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017PLoSO..1272870T/abstract https://paperity.org/p/80438622/predicting-floods-with-flickr-tags https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28235035/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5325575,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0172870,10.1371/journal.pone.0172870,2590136591,PMC5325575,0,006-895-902-060-01X; 009-289-489-777-779; 010-242-782-778-938; 010-684-671-664-16X; 012-482-006-614-012; 014-453-298-163-443; 014-956-950-431-483; 018-374-249-226-751; 034-066-051-498-474; 038-648-610-699-092; 047-833-998-321-280; 047-834-644-726-939; 048-416-486-582-240; 051-212-184-596-923; 052-614-599-362-094; 055-914-533-757-353; 065-083-641-843-812; 096-961-944-421-001; 103-084-707-348-605; 122-135-976-455-608; 134-021-650-677-200; 135-337-616-836-287; 166-651-158-671-752; 184-248-629-275-039; 188-334-832-312-022; 195-951-917-465-367,23,,(doi) 10.1371/journal.pone.0172870; (pmcid) pmc5325575; (coreid) 120012594; (pii) pone-d-16-36516; (pmid) 28235035; (magid) 2590136591,en

Jackson; William F. Mullen; Peggy Agouris; Andrew Crooks; Arie Croitoru; Anthony Stefanidis,"The assessment of the quality and accuracy of Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) contributions, and by extension the ultimate utility of VGI data has fostered much debate within the geographic community. The limited research to date has been focused on VGI data of linear features and has shown that the error in the data is heterogeneously distributed. Some have argued that data produced by numerous contributors will produce a more accurate product than an individual and some research on crowd-sourced initiatives has shown that to be true, although research on VGI is more infrequent. This paper proposes a method for quantifying the completeness and accuracy of a select subset of infrastructure-associated point datasets of volunteered geographic data within a major metropolitan area using a national geospatial dataset as the reference benchmark with two datasets from volunteers used as test datasets.

Citizen science has existed for centuries, but the recent adoption of information and communications technology (ICT) in this field (e.g. web- or mobile application-based interfaces for citizen training and data generation) has led to a massive surge in popularity, mainly due to reduced geographic barriers to citizen participation. Several challenges exist, however, to effectively utilize citizen-generated data for monitoring IAS (or other species of interest) at the global scale. Here, we conducted a systematic analysis of citizen science initiatives collecting IAS data using ICT, hoping to better understand their scientific contributions and challenges, their similarities/differences, and their interconnections. Through a search of the Scopus database, we identified 26 initiatives whose data had been used in scientific publications related to IAS, and based our analyses on these initiatives. The most common scientific uses of these citizen science data were to visualize the spatial distribution of IAS, better understand their behaviour/phenology, and elucidate citizen science data quality issues. To alleviate data quality concerns, most initiatives (19/26) had mechanisms for verifying citizen observations, such as user-submitted photographs. While many initiatives collected similar data parameters for each species observation, only 54% of the initiatives had a practice of data sharing. This lack of data sharing causes fragmentation of the citizen-generated IAS data, and is likely inhibiting the wider usage of the data for scientific studies on IAS involving large geographic scales (e.g. regional or global) and/or broad taxonomic scopes. To reduce this fragmentation and better consolidate the collected citizen science data, finally we provide some general data sharing guidelines for citizen science initiatives as well as individual volunteers.",21,,e00812,,Political science; Sociology of scientific knowledge; Citizen science; Data quality; Data sharing; Popularity; Test data generation; Knowledge management; Information and Communications Technology; Scopus,,,,"Ministry of the Environment, Government of Japan; IAS; Environment Research and Technology Development Fund; Predicting and Assessing Natural Capital and Ecosystem Services",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351989419304500 https://www.iges.or.jp/en/pub/citizen-science-and-invasive-species/en,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2019.e00812,10.1016/j.gecco.2019.e00812,2981309905,,0,004-375-987-884-074; 005-829-830-331-017; 006-533-099-458-265; 007-818-237-621-59X; 008-619-539-048-703; 010-083-427-527-282; 011-672-331-480-004; 014-656-921-731-415; 016-413-926-866-155; 017-041-950-239-209; 019-201-660-953-001; 019-986-856-315-856; 021-519-024-380-734; 021-730-482-774-486; 022-275-784-667-445; 024-762-906-224-193; 029-399-944-434-886; 033-665-985-066-470; 035-088-740-404-852; 035-173-348-934-791; 035-859-863-026-575; 036-240-803-825-065; 036-687-263-198-494; 041-813-534-515-216; 046-304-164-845-109; 047-040-811-996-73X; 047-829-738-077-072; 049-159-882-760-215; 056-966-609-020-886; 057-357-263-899-637; 057-545-918-303-995; 062-033-234-129-000; 065-925-450-993-410; 066-601-622-704-917; 066-917-283-239-467; 072-265-500-111-758; 074-893-334-060-253; 080-860-992-689-359; 084-149-167-565-234; 090-662-486-239-529; 091-649-220-781-249; 091-693-269-479-970; 103-081-387-145-206; 112-049-777-022-080; 127-031-057-285-228; 128-370-443-306-86X; 132-150-241-403-485; 135-741-184-978-875; 137-025-713-626-142; 140-584-254-149-525; 142-739-577-296-892; 149-776-356-225-860; 150-204-866-326-76X; 186-031-697-646-650,12,,(doi) 10.1016/j.gecco.2019.e00812; (magid) 2981309905,en

While its basic concept is generally understandable, approaches towards the density measure are manifold, diverse and of multidimensional complexity. This evolves from differing thematic, spatial and calculative specifications. Consequently, applied density measures are often used in a subjective, non-transparent, unspecific and thus non-comparable manner. In this paper, we aim at a systematic deconstruction of the measure density. Varying thematic, spatial and calculative dimensions show significant influence on the measure. With both quantitative and qualitative techniques of evaluation, we assess the particular influences on the measure density. To do so, we reduce our experiment setting to a mere physical perspective; that is, the quantitative measures building density, degree of soil sealing, floor space density and, more specifically, the density of generic structural classes such as open spaces and highest built-up density areas. Using up-to-date geodata derived from remote sensing and volunteered geographic information, we build upon high-quality spatial information products such as 3-D city models.

The Geodesign approach is used as the framework for underpinning the discussion. Selected case studies developed by the authors are presented showing how geo-UGC can be beneficial for building knowledge on current urban and territorial dynamics, for identifying possible alternative futures and for finding agreement on preferable future developments.

In order to achieve this, a Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) dataset was used, the OpenStreetMap (OSM) project. To test the developed model, a total of 8550 accidents with fatal or non-fatal injuries that occurred in the City of Zagreb from 2010 to 2014 were evaluated. Traffic accident data was collected using the pen-and-paper method while the traffic accident locations were determined using Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers embedded within police vehicles. This form of data entry invariably introduces errors in both geometric and contextual attributes. To fully counteract these errors, the developed model consists of two key concepts: the Jaro–Winkler string matching technique and the Inverse Distance Weighting method. Over 66% of traffic accident locations were validated, which is an increase of 15% when compared to the classical approach. The model outlined in this paper shows a significant improvement in estimating the correct location of traffic accidents. This in turn results in a drastic decrease in resources needed to estimate the quality of accident locations",68,,185,193,Data mining; Engineering; Data file; Traffic accident; Poison control; Simulation; Inverse distance weighting; Volunteered geographic information; Global Positioning System; String searching algorithm; Data validation,,,,Ministry of Interior of the Republic of Croatia,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968090X16300079 https://www.safetylit.org/citations/index.php?fuseaction=citations.viewdetails&citationIds[]=citjournalarticle_525465_12 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968090X16300079 https://core.ac.uk/display/81976224 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81976224.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trc.2016.04.003,10.1016/j.trc.2016.04.003,2341741027,,0,008-738-489-771-486; 014-064-933-974-116; 022-473-450-579-960; 025-906-886-088-214; 037-375-904-444-880; 037-456-087-839-878; 038-976-596-179-447; 039-194-276-513-418; 051-251-145-027-738; 052-256-580-904-386; 052-376-309-758-672; 058-413-848-496-139; 062-538-590-179-278; 078-449-947-410-839; 125-403-429-445-803; 126-199-063-117-32X; 132-253-023-658-65X; 140-416-220-363-723; 147-876-713-700-216; 170-318-922-191-611,10,,(magid) 2341741027; (coreid) 81976224; (doi) 10.1016/j.trc.2016.04.003,en

San Miguel; Lizeth I. Tamayo; Casandra Robledo; Carola T. Sánchez Díaz; Araceli Lucio; Nora Coronado; Carol Estwing Ferrans,"Abstract Background Latinas suffer disproportionately from breast cancer (BC) in part due to lower guideline-concordant screening. Multiple intervention approaches have been developed to promote screening through direct patient education and empowerment approaches (i.e., training community members to share BC information). This study compares the relative effects of these approaches on: 1) women's BC screening; and, 2) women's dissemination of BC information within their social networks. Design/methods Our quasi-experimental trial is being implemented in community venues in two predominantly Latino neighborhoods in South and West Chicago. Eligible participants: 1) are female; 2) are 52–74 years old; 3) have not obtained a mammogram in the past 2 years; and, 4) have not previously participated in health-related volunteerism. Based on their geographic location, participants are assigned to one of two group-based interventions. Both interventions consist of three two-hour sessions, which includes BC early detection education. The education intervention sessions also covers BC prevention (diet, physical activity), whereas the empowerment intervention covers sharing information with family/friends, and health volunteerism. Navigation is provided for all women who wish to obtain mammograms. Primary outcomes include: 1) receipt of BC screening; and, 2) participants' dissemination of BC information. Secondary outcomes include positive changes in 1) participants' self-reported psychosocial facilitators; and, 2) social network members' BC behaviors. Discussion The design of our program allows for a preliminary comparison of the effectiveness of these two approaches. This work will inform larger comparativeness trials and offers a new approach to intervention evaluation via social network analysis.",71,,1,8,Social network analysis; Psychosocial; Empowerment; Health equity; Psychological intervention; Patient education; Family medicine; Location; Medicine; Social network,Breast cancer; Health disparities; Latinas; Screening,Aged; Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis; Community Networks/organization & administration; Early Detection of Cancer/methods; Female; Hispanic Americans/education; Humans; Information Dissemination/methods; Mammography/methods; Middle Aged; Non-Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Patient Education as Topic/methods; Patient Participation/methods; Program Evaluation; United States/epidemiology; Women's Health/ethnology,,NCI NIH HHS (K01 CA193918) United States; NCATS NIH HHS (UL1 TR002003) United States,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1551714418301769 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/29803815 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29803815,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cct.2018.05.013,10.1016/j.cct.2018.05.013,2803953997,PMC6067958,0,000-775-212-170-188; 002-195-578-223-119; 003-041-518-451-544; 004-695-660-036-041; 005-318-842-237-314; 005-915-404-156-763; 006-351-378-631-57X; 008-583-321-206-965; 008-925-301-258-212; 011-163-765-681-764; 011-415-643-234-163; 011-692-164-778-919; 011-994-480-098-812; 012-932-726-696-285; 013-326-097-951-605; 014-133-744-125-998; 014-141-181-608-784; 014-655-966-547-078; 015-329-344-613-010; 016-290-360-420-05X; 017-383-062-687-783; 017-778-886-230-379; 020-162-204-651-970; 020-670-804-201-405; 022-348-313-118-102; 023-741-236-599-826; 023-872-698-250-469; 025-552-389-439-284; 026-865-832-312-848; 030-080-811-806-392; 032-049-177-406-929; 032-362-556-695-186; 033-699-518-242-645; 035-409-772-650-657; 035-849-398-665-419; 036-569-138-652-582; 037-556-873-339-764; 038-985-583-843-067; 041-913-367-688-846; 043-848-933-167-792; 043-860-037-757-817; 045-281-465-524-215; 046-049-982-152-827; 049-694-842-582-180; 050-770-504-031-607; 052-042-918-742-625; 054-556-033-818-793; 057-524-885-152-867; 058-129-907-610-360; 059-127-879-434-52X; 061-442-173-260-603; 061-516-381-155-727; 062-208-858-788-436; 064-244-874-515-500; 064-367-666-627-735; 064-912-162-747-443; 065-133-297-093-970; 068-421-856-218-879; 070-333-413-090-791; 072-719-149-812-779; 079-181-810-263-921; 080-208-104-842-726; 083-991-453-844-734; 090-002-408-622-262; 091-933-019-748-381; 094-209-584-790-453; 097-254-602-733-981; 107-849-284-765-075; 108-516-104-254-851; 111-108-748-286-360; 116-326-596-102-936; 120-661-314-304-648; 123-047-974-624-89X; 128-903-898-731-220; 132-346-707-970-84X; 145-377-225-983-051; 153-055-801-051-665; 163-770-010-183-472; 175-032-391-275-266; 191-807-344-289-13X,1,"research support, n.i.h., extramural; research support, non-u.s. gov't",(pmid) 29803815; (doi) 10.1016/j.cct.2018.05.013; (magid) 2803953997; (pii) s1551-7144(18)30176-9; (pmcid) pmc6067958,en

However, while this number of contributors seems impressive, questions remain about the individual contributions that have been made by the project members. This research article contains several studies regarding the contributions by the community of the project. The results show that only 38% (192,000) of the registered members carried out at least one edit in the OSM database and that only 5% (24,000) of all members actively contributed to the project in a more productive way. The majority of the members are located in Europe (72%) and each member has an activity area whose size may range from one soccer field up to more than 50 km2.

009-038-615-654-352,Technical Guidelines to Extract and Analyze VGI from Different Platforms,2016-09-24,2016,conference proceedings,Data,23065729,MDPI AG,,Levente Juhász; Adam Rousell; Jamal Jokar Arsanjani,"An increasing number of Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) and social media platforms have been continuously growing in size, which have provided massive georeferenced data in many forms including textual information, photographs, and geoinformation. These georeferenced data have either been actively contributed (e.g., adding data to OpenStreetMap (OSM) or Mapillary) or collected in a more passive fashion by enabling geolocation whilst using an online platform (e.g., Twitter, Instagram, or Flickr). The benefit of scraping and streaming these data in stand-alone applications is evident, however, it is difficult for many users to script and scrape the diverse types of these data. On 14 June 2016, a pre-conference workshop at the AGILE 2016 conference in Helsinki, Finland was held. The workshop was called “LINK-VGI: LINKing and analyzing VGI across different platforms”. The workshop provided an opportunity for interested researchers to share ideas and findings on cross-platform data contributions. One portion of the workshop was dedicated to a hands-on session. In this session, the basics of spatial data access through selected Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and the extraction of summary statistics of the results were illustrated. This paper presents the content of the hands-on session including the scripts and guidelines for extracting VGI data. Researchers, planners, and interested end-users can benefit from this paper for developing their own application for any region of the world.",1,3,15,,World Wide Web; Agile software development; Spatial analysis; Geolocation; Computer science; Geographic information system; Social media; Volunteered geographic information; Scripting language; Application programming interface,,,,,https://doi.org/10.3390/data1030015 https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5729/1/3/15/pdf https://vbn.aau.dk/files/265979990/data_01_00015_v2_1_.pdf https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/data/data1.html#JuhaszRA16 https://core.ac.uk/display/84876296 https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5729/1/3/15/html,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/data1030015,10.3390/data1030015,2525560054,,0,000-967-721-739-893; 002-775-989-388-146; 010-867-805-516-173; 016-316-927-068-329; 023-036-742-444-209; 024-023-380-720-176; 038-976-596-179-447; 040-267-517-107-219; 072-243-912-426-29X; 079-150-284-796-055; 088-339-711-439-200; 107-091-075-810-582; 126-576-668-406-897; 171-544-875-588-246; 172-081-485-715-076,4,,(coreid) 84876296; (magid) 2525560054; (doi) 10.3390/data1030015,en

This data article makes available labeled, storm-related social media data collected over a six-hour period during a severe storm and F1 tornado that struck Central Pennsylvania on May 1st, 2017. Three datasets were collected from Twitter using location, keyword, and network filtering techniques, respectively. Only 2% of the 22,706 total tweets overlap among the datasets, providing researchers with a broader scope of information than normally available when collecting tweets using location (i.e., geotag-based) and keyword filtering alone or in combination during a crisis. Each data collection technique is described in detail, including network filtering which collects data from networks of social media users associated with a geographic area. The datasets are manually labeled for information content and toponym usage. The 22,706 tweet IDs, dehydrated for privacy, are labeled for relevance (storm-related and off-topic) and 19 types of storm-related information organized into six categories: infrastructure damage, service disruption, personal experience, weather updates, weather forecasts, and weather warnings. Data are also labeled for toponym usage (with or without toponyms), location (local, remote, and generic toponyms), and granularity (hyperlocal, municipal, and regional toponyms). The comprehensively labeled datasets provide researchers with opportunities to analyze crisis-related information behaviors and volunteered location information behaviors during a hyperlocal crisis event, as well as develop and evaluate automated filtering, geolocation, and event detection techniques that can aid citizens and crisis responders.",30,,105595,,Data collection; Tornado; Geolocation; Information retrieval; Information behavior; Hyperlocal; Computer science; Social media; Volunteered geographic information; Emergency management,Crisis informatics; Emergency management; Information behavior; Risk communication; Twitter; volunteered geographic information,,,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32382607/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32382607 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340920304893,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2020.105595,10.1016/j.dib.2020.105595,3018191977,PMC7200777,0,004-654-014-694-807; 012-199-283-061-141; 017-995-221-886-016; 018-392-325-202-807; 027-201-386-112-049; 034-781-634-707-47X; 041-793-028-069-027; 056-846-643-361-397; 068-504-346-969-721; 115-101-495-238-080; 116-190-269-082-819,1,,(pmcid) pmc7200777; (pmid) 32382607; (pii) s2352-3409(20)30489-3; (doi) 10.1016/j.dib.2020.105595; (magid) 3018191977,en

The example of the recreational infrastructure in Berchtesgaden National Park,,2017,journal article,eco.mont (Journal on Protected Mountain Areas Research),2073106x; 20731558,Osterreichische Akademie der Wissenschaften,Austria,Sabine Hennig,"The availability of spatial data is a key concern in protected area management, including visitor management. Obtaining spatial data is often laborious and expensive. New approaches involving the general public in data collection can provide a solution. Among existing crowdsourcing initiatives, OpenStreetMap (OSM) is the largest. But, while public participation geographic information systems (PPGIS), volunteered geographic information (VGI), and user-generated content (UGC) are used in visitor management, OSM still receives less attention. In this paper, questions regarding the possibilities of using OSM data in visitor management are discussed. The focus is on recreational infrastructure data, since infrastructure is an important means for guiding and managing visitors. The Berchtesgaden National Park (Germany) served as the study area. A list of the relevant elements of the recreational infrastructure in the protected area was elaborated, and an analysis was carried out to determine how useful the OSM tagging system is for describing these elements. In addition, data held in the OSM database was assessed first with regard to which infrastructure elements the OSM database holds data for, and second for the amount of data held. Along with the benefits, there are also challenges in using OSM. Thus, there is a need to expand the OSM tagging system to allow the description of different types of nature-based recreational infrastructure and to increase people’s involvement in OSM",9,2,30,41,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1553/eco.mont-9-2s30,10.1553/eco.mont-9-2s30,,,0,,4,,(doi) 10.1553/eco.mont-9-2s30; (coreid) 85164735,en

Brooks; Todd Sherer; Sohini Chowdhury,"BACKGROUND As in other therapeutic areas, clinical studies in Parkinson's disease (PD) face significant recruitment challenges. However, qualitative surveys suggest that individuals with PD are willing to participate in clinical research. The Michael J. Fox Foundation therefore established Fox Trial Finder in 2011 to facilitate connection between PD research teams and volunteers. OBJECTIVE Characterize the research volunteers (with and without PD) registered on Fox Trial Finder as of June 2014, and the published, recruiting studies to identify trends and highlight gaps between research requirements and available volunteers. METHODS Profiles of volunteers with and without PD were analyzed to explore trends in geography, demographics, family history and, for those volunteers with PD, disease progression and treatment history. Clinical study profiles were analyzed to determine study type, phase, sponsor, focus, location and eligibility criteria. The analysis focused on volunteers and studies based in the United States. RESULTS The database contained 26,261 US-based volunteers, including 19,243 volunteers (73%) with PD and 7,018 (27%) controls without PD. The average time since diagnosis for PD volunteers was 5.7 years and the average age at diagnosis was 58 years. Control volunteers were more likely than volunteers with PD to be female (67% vs. 35%) and to have a family history of PD (49% vs. 12%). CONCLUSIONS Fox Trial Finder's registration history to date demonstrates the high level of willingness among individuals affected by PD to participate in clinical research and provide a significant amount of personal health information to facilitate that participation.",5,1,55,66,Physical therapy; Observational study; Disease; Patient recruitment; Family history; Preliminary analysis; Age at diagnosis; Clinical research; Clinical trial,Parkinson's disease; clinical trial; observational study; patient recruitment; research subject recruitment,Clinical Trials as Topic/psychology; Data Collection; Female; Humans; Internet; Male; Middle Aged; Parkinson Disease/therapy; Patient Selection; Research Design; United States/epidemiology,,,https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-parkinsons-disease/jpd140522 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25624422 https://www.michaeljfox.org/files/foundation/A-Preliminary-Analysis-of-Fox-Trial-Finder.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/jpd-140522,10.3233/jpd-140522,1564714386,,0,015-435-017-067-787; 027-146-244-052-934; 027-362-198-002-181; 037-026-517-185-385; 064-399-716-365-486; 069-019-916-310-775; 115-356-332-754-165; 151-413-680-681-883,7,"research support, non-u.s. gov't",(pmid) 25624422; (pii) x10l404468625844; (doi) 10.3233/jpd-140522; (magid) 1564714386,en

Individual laboratories, through connection with other laboratories or networks, are able enhance their capacity for preparedness and response to emergencies. Efficient networks often establish standards and maintain best practices within member laboratories. The Global Laboratory Directory Mapping tool (GLaDMap) supports the efforts of laboratory networks to improve their connectivity by providing a simple and efficient tool to profile laboratories by geographic location, function or expertise. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the effectiveness of the GLaDMap search tool and the completeness of the descriptive content of networks and laboratories that are currently contained within the GLaDMap database. We determined the extent of information volunteered and how the system is being used. Although the system aims to attract an array of users from around the globe, our analysis reveals minimal participation and information sharing and that the low profile participation rate limits the tool’s functionality.

010-193-298-988-900,Analysis of avalanche risk factors in backcountry terrain based on usage frequency and accident data in Switzerland,2015-09-09,2015,journal article,Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences,16849981; 15618633,Copernicus GmbH,Germany,Frank Techel; Benjamin Zweifel; Kurt Winkler,"Abstract. Recreational activities in snow-covered mountainous terrain in the backcountry account for the vast majority of avalanche accidents. Studies analyzing avalanche risk mostly rely on accident statistics without considering exposure (or the elements at risk), i.e., how many, when and where people are recreating, as data on recreational activity in the winter mountains are scarce. To fill this gap, we explored volunteered geographic information on two social media mountaineering websites – bergportal.ch and camptocamp.org. Based on these data, we present a spatiotemporal pattern of winter backcountry touring activity in the Swiss Alps and compare this with accident statistics. Geographically, activity was concentrated in Alpine regions relatively close to the main Swiss population centers in the west and north. In contrast, accidents occurred equally often in the less-frequented inner-alpine regions. Weekends, weather and avalanche conditions influenced the number of recreationists, while the odds to be involved in a severe avalanche accident did not depend on weekends or weather conditions. However, the likelihood of being involved in an accident increased with increasing avalanche danger level, but also with a more unfavorable snowpack containing persistent weak layers (also referred to as an old snow problem). In fact, the most critical situation for backcountry recreationists and professionals occurred on days and in regions when both the avalanche danger was critical and when the snowpack contained persistent weak layers. The frequently occurring geographical pattern of a more unfavorable snowpack structure also explains the relatively high proportion of accidents in the less-frequented inner-alpine regions. These results have practical implications: avalanche forecasters should clearly communicate the avalanche danger and the avalanche problem to the backcountry user, particularly if persistent weak layers are of concern. Professionals and recreationists, on the other hand, require the expertise to adjust the planning of a tour and their backcountry travel behavior depending on the avalanche danger and the avalanche problem.",15,9,1985,1997,Physical geography; Recreation; Odds; Travel behavior; Meteorology; Terrain; Geography; Snowpack; Population; Mountaineering; Volunteered geographic information,,,,,http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015NHESS..15.1985T/abstract https://core.ac.uk/display/89891073 https://nhess.copernicus.org/articles/15/1985/2015/ https://nhess.copernicus.org/articles/15/1985/2015/nhess-15-1985-2015.pdf https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20153426091 https://www.nat-hazards-earth-syst-sci.net/15/1985/2015/nhess-15-1985-2015.pdf https://www.dora.lib4ri.ch/wsl/islandora/object/wsl:3165 https://noa.gwlb.de/receive/cop_mods_00015245,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/nhess-15-1985-2015,10.5194/nhess-15-1985-2015,1649553478,,0,017-300-374-304-052; 019-899-557-393-875; 022-632-317-776-75X; 024-490-301-870-460; 026-581-862-732-638; 030-350-325-084-571; 031-515-356-030-540; 037-065-449-391-460; 040-184-564-272-635; 040-267-517-107-219; 041-793-028-069-027; 049-634-274-450-838; 051-944-313-067-707; 057-545-918-303-995; 065-346-869-208-139; 070-657-121-683-510; 073-372-719-588-34X; 075-592-403-717-712; 078-020-740-228-317; 082-056-207-136-931; 097-612-174-011-049; 113-874-184-226-21X; 115-308-340-278-262; 118-123-240-817-060; 121-338-520-449-000; 144-914-809-311-587; 171-544-875-588-246; 171-661-294-853-964; 172-439-273-568-08X; 194-824-243-076-219; 199-137-752-502-391,26,,(magid) 1649553478; (doi) 10.5194/nhess-15-1985-2015; (coreid) 89891073,en

Foody; Linda See; Steffen Fritz; M. van der Velde; Christoph Perger; Christian Schill; Doreen S. Boyd; Alexis J. Comber,"Crowdsourcing is a popular means of acquiring data, but the use of such data is limited by concerns with its quality. This is evident within cartography and geographical sciences more generally, with the quality of volunteered geographic information (VGI) recognized as a major challenge to address if the full potential of citizen sensing in mapping applications is to be realized. Here, a means to characterize the quality of volunteers, based only on the data they contribute, was used to explore issues connected with the quantity and quality of volunteers for attribute mapping. The focus was on data in the form of annotations or class labels provided by volunteers who visually interpreted an attribute, land cover, from a series of satellite sensor images. A latent class model was found to be able to provide accurate characterisations of the quality of volunteers in terms of the accuracy of their labelling, irrespective of the number of cases that they labelled. The accuracy with which a volunteer could be characterized tended to increase with the number of volunteers contributing but was typically good at all but small numbers of volunteers. Moreover, the ability to characterize volunteers in terms of the quality of their labelling could be used constructively. For example, volunteers could be ranked in terms of quality which could then be used to select a sub-set as input to a subsequent mapping task. This was particularly important as an identified subset of volunteers could undertake a task more accurately than when part of a larger group of volunteers. The results highlight that both the quantity and quality of volunteers need consideration and that the use of VGI may be enhanced through information on the quality of the volunteers derived entirely from the data provided without any additional information.",52,4,336,344,Citizen science; Ranking; Geography; Information retrieval; Volunteer; Neogeography; Volunteered geographic information; Crowdsourcing; Latent class model; Thematic map,,,,,https://nottingham-repository.worktribe.com/output/981274 http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/32062/ http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/10757/ https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00087041.2015.1108658 https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alexis_Comber/publication/272251344_Accurate_Attribute_Mapping_from_Volunteered_Geographic_Information_Issues_of_Volunteer_Quantity_and_Quality/links/54eb0a990cf25ba91c84c2a8.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00087041.2015.1108658,10.1080/00087041.2015.1108658,2063375773,,0,002-555-907-164-663; 006-149-357-136-300; 007-857-101-229-718; 007-887-125-840-279; 008-976-078-444-281; 019-362-199-226-515; 022-578-276-452-171; 026-645-756-189-301; 027-486-299-838-927; 032-519-429-714-578; 035-161-913-145-763; 035-601-620-371-851; 040-267-517-107-219; 050-798-241-571-031; 055-524-866-430-670; 056-689-719-832-399; 057-545-918-303-995; 060-716-274-159-466; 072-243-912-426-29X; 077-685-278-656-310; 078-459-706-995-898; 082-811-823-576-339; 084-702-856-554-857; 089-361-446-433-568; 097-338-432-344-323; 097-612-174-011-049; 098-565-405-790-308; 107-977-366-446-20X; 117-392-548-043-830; 119-518-174-117-770; 122-656-286-991-79X; 125-413-697-432-08X; 134-083-809-434-096; 138-673-529-421-480; 141-047-060-911-705; 142-269-836-725-011; 147-876-713-700-216,34,,(doi) 10.1080/00087041.2015.1108658; (coreid) 141272824; (magid) 2063375773,en

Yan,"Background Hypertension is a major modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease, the world's leading cause of death. The prevalence of hypertension is disproportionately higher in South Asian countries than in other regions of the world. Screening for hypertension in primary care settings remains a challenge in many South Asian countries, including Nepal. Nepal is located in the Himalayan Mountains region, posing significant geographical challenges for its rural citizens to access primary health care and service delivery. This barrier increases the costs and inconvenience for rural Nepalis to access hypertension screening and treatment. As a result, the prevalence of hypertension in Nepal tripled in the last 25 years to 22.4%-38.6%. Nepal's Ministry of Health and Population relies on female community health volunteers to link health centers and communities to provide basic health services. Over 50,000 of these volunteers in Nepal have received basic health care training and are assigned to take care of maternal and child health. Due to limited health care resources, adopting new methods to control hypertension is an urgent need in Nepal. Several recent studies in Nepal have recommended extending the role of female community health volunteers to include hypertension management through blood pressure monitoring and home-based education. Objective The goal of this study was to assess if a mobile health-based female community health volunteer approach of combining the traditional community health volunteer program with digital technologies would be feasible and acceptable in rural Nepa. Methods In this study, we recruited 17 female community health volunteers and extended their role from maternal and child health to hypertension management through screening blood pressures. Results All 17 female community health volunteers successfully measured 1113 rural Nepalis' blood pressures, identified 169 hypertensive patients, and collected health behaviors data of the 169 hypertensive patients. Among the 169 patients, 70% of them had a mobile phone, and 92% were interested in receiving health-related information via a mobile phone. Among those who were interested in receiving information via a mobile phone, 84% preferred voice calls, and 7% and 1% preferred texting and apps, respectively. Conclusions Results from this study indicate that a digital health intervention that leverages feature-phones combined with female community health volunteers may be an acceptable and pragmatic way to implement an evidence-based program to reduce hypertension in rural Nepal.",8,6,e19048,,Cross-sectional study; Health care; Community health; Disease; mHealth; Digital health; Population; Service delivery framework; Medicine; Environmental health,,,,,https://mhealth.jmir.org/2020/3/e15419/ https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32149712/ https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/15419 https://www.scilit.net/article/2d6f6fc1d28ba7ec5c9df41dc846508a http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/15419 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32149712,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/19048,10.2196/19048,2995842176,PMC7317624,0,000-767-708-957-03X; 002-372-618-823-245; 003-491-307-602-70X; 006-385-883-455-55X; 007-548-873-964-182; 010-177-698-913-852; 014-061-369-344-848; 014-649-512-934-937; 018-016-823-524-789; 024-212-059-476-421; 026-189-891-181-277; 027-076-680-402-012; 030-605-077-819-074; 034-265-546-450-853; 034-923-577-224-965; 036-901-039-467-949; 041-336-822-731-061; 041-618-183-217-247; 046-468-114-801-15X; 052-289-001-836-982; 055-879-474-249-349; 066-660-029-449-548; 070-041-407-201-972; 072-429-236-926-832; 078-651-223-753-069; 079-485-655-846-459; 082-067-481-765-38X; 086-186-686-636-343; 087-097-632-816-463; 090-804-830-713-64X; 100-216-460-411-571; 100-356-084-607-785; 121-520-955-473-473; 143-923-461-013-113,3,published erratum,(doi) 10.2196/19048; (pii) v8i6e19048; (pmid) 32525811; (pmcid) pmc7317624; (magid) 2995842176,en

Despite limited scientific evidence about its risks and benefits, full-body CT screening is available to self-referred individuals. The purpose of this study was to develop a scientific knowledge base about patient expectations of the procedure and to determine whether characteristics of patients influence their expectations of its health benefits.MATERIALS AND METHODS.

011-165-874-683-362,The use of LiDAR and volunteered geographic information to map flood extents and inundation,2012-07-20,2012,journal article,"ISPRS Annals of Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences",21949050,Copernicus GmbH,,Kevin McDougall; P. Temple-Watts,"<jats:p>Abstract. Floods are one of the most destructive natural disasters that threaten communities and properties. In recent decades, flooding has claimed more lives, destroyed more houses and ruined more agricultural land than any other natural hazard. The accurate prediction of the areas of inundation from flooding is critical to saving lives and property, but relies heavily on accurate digital elevation and hydrologic models. The 2011 Brisbane floods provided a unique opportunity to capture high resolution digital aerial imagery as the floods neared their peak, allowing the capture of areas of inundation over the various city suburbs. This high quality imagery, together with accurate LiDAR data over the area and publically available volunteered geographic imagery through repositories such as Flickr, enabled the reconstruction of flood extents and the assessment of both area and depth of inundation for the assessment of damage. In this study, approximately 20 images of flood damaged properties were utilised to identify the peak of the flood. Accurate position and height values were determined through the use of RTK GPS and conventional survey methods. This information was then utilised in conjunction with river gauge information to generate a digital flood surface. The LiDAR generated DEM was then intersected with the flood surface to reconstruct the area of inundation. The model determined areas of inundation were then compared to the mapped flood extent from the high resolution digital imagery to assess the accuracy of the process. The paper concludes that accurate flood extent prediction or mapping is possible through this method, although its accuracy is dependent on the number and location of sampled points. The utilisation of LiDAR generated DEMs and DSMs can also provide an excellent mechanism to estimate depths of inundation and hence flood damage;                     </jats:p>",I-4,1,251,256,Hydrological modelling; Elevation; Flooding (psychology); Natural hazard; Environmental science; Lidar; Volunteered geographic information; Remote sensing; Flood myth; Real Time Kinematic,,,,,https://www.isprs-ann-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/I-4/251/2012/ http://eprints.usq.edu.au/21693/ http://eprints.usq.edu.au/21693/7/McDougall_Temple-Watts_ISPRS_2012_PV.pdf https://www.isprs-ann-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/I-4/251/2012/isprsannals-I-4-251-2012.pdf http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ISPAn..I4..251M/abstract https://noa.gwlb.de/receive/cop_mods_00025420,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/isprsannals-i-4-251-2012,10.5194/isprsannals-i-4-251-2012,2135322774,,0,005-374-785-075-748; 006-056-479-692-521; 014-260-183-064-524; 035-999-582-439-87X; 052-798-051-412-85X; 057-545-918-303-995; 058-217-117-261-637; 064-008-661-353-363; 072-243-912-426-29X; 082-811-823-576-339; 085-423-968-575-737; 109-969-479-315-727; 112-842-373-986-928; 124-213-011-285-458,18,,(coreid) 92132517; (magid) 2135322774; (doi) 10.5194/isprsannals-i-4-251-2012,en

Such information is rarely openly available and if available, would vary between cities by nomenclature, making comparisons between places difficult. Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) including data from social media represents new potential sources of building function data that have not yet been exploited for this purpose. Using a part of the city of Milan as the study area, building data from OSM and points of interest (POIs) from OSM, Facebook and Foursquare were extracted to derive the building function. This resulted in the classification of building function for more than 80&lt;span class=""thinspace""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;% of the buildings and demonstrated that both Facebook and Foursquare can complement the building function derived from OSM, helping to fill in missing gaps. This preliminary study has demonstrated the potential of this approach for deriving building function information from open data in a simple way yet still requires independent validation with alternative sources as well as extension to other areas that have different amounts of OSM and social media coverage.&lt;/p&gt;;                     </jats:p>",XLII-4,,209,215,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-xlii-4-209-2018,10.5194/isprs-archives-xlii-4-209-2018,,,0,,1,,(doi) 10.5194/isprs-archives-xlii-4-209-2018,de

It has been identified in both online and offline projects that rely on volunteers’ effort over the past 20 years and, therefore, can be expected to appear in new projects. This chapter looks at participation inequality (also known as the 1% rule or the 90-9-1 rule), its origins and some of its characteristics. The chapter also explains how participation inequality emerges in a project at both temporal and spatial scales, and also evaluates its implication on the use of VGI and citizen science data. The chapter suggests a generic rule for analysts of VGI and citizen science datasets, in the form: ‘When using and analysing crowdsourced information, consider the implications of participation inequality on the data and take them into account in the analysis.’",,,35,44,Sociology; Regional science; Citizen science; Online and offline; Inequality; Phenomenon; 1% rule; Volunteered geographic information,,,,,https://www.ubiquitypress.com/site/chapters/10.5334/bax.c/ https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1519860/ https://www.ubiquitypress.com/site/chapters/e/10.5334/bax.c/,http://dx.doi.org/10.5334/bax.c,10.5334/bax.c,2511344124,,0,,30,,(doi) 10.5334/bax.c; (magid) 2511344124,en

Surface water maps can be generated by combining measurements from multiple sources. Precise estimation of surface water using satellite imagery remains a challenging task due to the sensor limitations, complex land cover, topography, and atmospheric conditions. As a complementary dataset, in the case of hilly landscapes, a drainage network can be extracted from high-resolution digital elevation models. Additionally, Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) initiatives, such as OpenStreetMap, can also be used to produce high-resolution surface water masks. In this study, we derive a high-resolution water mask using Landsat 8 imagery and OpenStreetMap as well as (potential) a drainage network using 30 m SRTM. Our approach to derive a surface water mask from Landsat 8 imagery comprises the use of a lower 15% percentile of Landsat 8 Top of Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance from 2013 to 2015. We introduce a new non-parametric unsupervised method based on the Canny edge filter and Otsu thresholding to detect water in flat areas. For hilly areas, the method is extended with an additional supervised classification step used to refine the water mask. We applied the method across the Murray-Darling basin, Australia. Differences between our new Landsat-based water mask and the OpenStreetMap water mask regarding positional differences along the rivers and overall coverage were analyzed. Our results show that about 50% of the OpenStreetMap linear water features can be confirmed using the water mask extracted from Landsat 8 imagery and the drainage network derived from SRTM. We also show that the observed distances between river features derived from OpenStreetMap and Landsat 8 are mostly smaller than 60 m. The differences between the new water mask and SRTM-based linear features and hilly areas are slightly larger (110 m).

VGI collection has been proven to serve as a highly successful means of acquiring timely and detailed global spatial data. However, VGI includes several special properties. For example, the contributor’s reputation affects the quality of objects edited, and a geographic object may have multiple versions. The existing spatio-temporal data model cannot describe the unique properties of VGI. Therefore, a spatio-temporal VGI model considering trust-related information is presented in this paper. In this model, central elements of the VGI environment, e.g., geographic entity, entity state, state version, contributor, reputation, geographic event, and edit event, and their interaction mechanisms are analysed. Major VGI objects and relations are determined using the object-oriented method and trust-related operations, and their relationships are analysed, and nine linkage rules among trust-related operations are found to maintain the consistency of corresponding data. A prototype system for the spatio-temporal VGI model is presented, and the effectiveness of the model is verified.",5,2,10,,World Wide Web; Spatial analysis; Geography; Data science; Geographic object; Geographic entity; Reputation; Volunteered geographic information; Data model,,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China,https://core.ac.uk/display/89908588 https://doaj.org/article/b84e188888cb4541963d359172b8b939 https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/5/2/10 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ijgi/ijgi5.html#ZhaoZLX16a https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/5/2/10/pdf http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016IJGI....5...10Z/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi5020010,10.3390/ijgi5020010,2260876836,,0,006-057-019-890-636; 006-326-781-866-112; 007-684-128-166-136; 010-603-228-708-036; 011-165-874-683-362; 011-904-411-838-133; 012-729-956-228-766; 013-803-494-618-557; 014-425-368-123-634; 015-191-212-706-128; 015-263-008-123-566; 015-764-754-857-014; 016-588-276-860-652; 017-008-646-646-77X; 017-614-610-102-13X; 019-731-811-282-435; 020-498-603-796-092; 022-473-450-579-960; 023-555-345-378-855; 029-263-057-554-467; 030-217-575-405-566; 030-416-570-557-01X; 030-975-962-975-895; 032-353-715-439-039; 035-042-683-916-582; 038-976-596-179-447; 043-049-770-785-770; 044-812-755-184-363; 044-959-485-802-171; 051-949-085-552-200; 057-545-918-303-995; 071-054-510-245-788; 072-376-013-047-308; 075-869-838-337-064; 080-252-204-989-31X; 084-376-137-252-907; 088-339-711-439-200; 097-612-174-011-049; 097-773-332-306-457; 098-565-405-790-308; 101-730-056-244-941; 103-292-802-715-369; 103-859-285-040-344; 104-912-895-086-792; 132-594-716-926-149; 135-360-535-210-851; 147-876-713-700-216; 150-441-650-870-124; 152-980-324-742-114; 158-847-532-778-731; 169-004-007-623-620; 186-307-712-057-083; 187-667-270-002-637; 188-678-650-340-531; 198-122-408-150-421,16,,(coreid) 89908588; (magid) 2260876836; (doi) 10.3390/ijgi5020010,en

Teaching geography, geology, or biology beyond the traditional classroom allows students to interact with physical and social environments for meaningful learning. Mobile devices that are based on geospatial technologies have provided more accurate data, but also a combined instructional design with other WebGIS, map viewers, or geographic information system (GIS) layers, which are useful to foster education for sustainable development. This paper analyzes the applications of mobile learning based on citizen science and volunteer geographic information, but also on the growing awareness that citizens and educators need a set of digital competencies to enhance and innovate lifelong learning and active citizenship. The empirical research aims to measure teacher–training experience, highlighting the potential of mobile devices and their applications in environmental education. Data collected from the research and results prove the positive impact of mobile learning in environmental education.

While most analyses focus on geometric and positional quality, only sporadic attention has been devoted to the interpretation of the data, i.e., the communication process through which consumers try to reconstruct the meaning of information intended by its producers. Interpretability is a notoriously ephemeral, culturally rooted, and context-dependent property of the data that concerns the conceptual quality of the vocabularies, schemas, ontologies, and documentation used to describe and annotate the geographic features of interest. To operationalize conceptual quality in VGI, we propose a multi-faceted framework that includes accuracy, granularity, completeness, consistency, compliance, and richness, proposing proxy measures for each dimension. The application of the framework is illustrated in a case study on a European sample of OpenStreetMap, focused specifically on conceptual compliance.",,,89,107,Ontology (information science); Schema (psychology); Geography; Data quality; Cornerstone; Interpretability; Documentation; Knowledge management; Volunteered geographic information; Operationalization,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/cosit/cosit2015.html#BallatoreZ15 https://escholarship.org/uc/item/67c9g3b4 http://core.ac.uk/display/30771523 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-23374-1_5/fulltext.html https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-23374-1_5 https://escholarship.org/uc/item/67c9g3b4.pdf https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23374-1_5 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-23374-1_5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23374-1_5,10.1007/978-3-319-23374-1_5,2122171464,,0,001-282-841-493-685; 002-033-358-303-30X; 002-138-818-558-68X; 013-036-280-323-441; 014-845-068-774-33X; 016-493-964-783-054; 026-645-756-189-301; 029-818-479-400-106; 030-217-575-405-566; 030-336-610-018-011; 030-975-962-975-895; 038-976-596-179-447; 040-267-517-107-219; 043-529-289-019-677; 051-240-162-501-389; 051-457-536-845-758; 059-506-034-265-023; 062-194-518-566-314; 069-199-916-826-078; 075-516-361-159-497; 078-061-364-389-723; 078-316-098-482-379; 097-338-432-344-323; 097-612-174-011-049; 105-213-938-893-054; 112-436-957-441-055; 121-989-995-548-685; 124-043-027-110-303; 134-639-946-484-816; 142-322-330-712-15X; 147-876-713-700-216; 149-640-562-924-31X; 164-241-021-060-446; 165-971-328-458-759; 171-544-875-588-246,37,,(doi) 10.1007/978-3-319-23374-1_5; (magid) 2122171464,en

Described as Web-mapping 2.0, it is especially characterized by high interactivity and geolocation-based contents generated by users. A series of recent events (hurricanes, earthquakes, pandemics) have urged the development of numerous mapping Web applications intended to provide information to the public, and encourage their contribution to support crisis management. This new way to produce and spread geographic information in times of crisis brings up many questions and new potentials with regard to urgency services, Non Governmental Organisations (NGO), as well as individuals.

The EIA scoping and reviewing stages often involve public participation. Although its importance has long been recognized, public participation in the EIA process is often regarded as ineffective, due to time, budget, resource, technical and procedural constraints, as well as the complexity of environmental information. Geographic Information System (GIS) and Volunteer Geographic Information (VGI) have the potential to contribute to data collection, sharing and presentation, utilize local user-generated content to benefit decision-making and increase public outreach. This research integrated GIS, VGI, social media tools, data mining and mobile technology to design a spatially intelligent framework that presented and shared EIA information effectively to the public. A spatially intelligent public participative system (SIPPS) was also developed as a proof-of-concept of the framework. The research selected the Tehachapi Renewable Transmission Project (TRTP) as the pilot study area. Survey questionnaires were designed to collect feedback and conduct evaluation. Results show that SIPPS was able to improve the effectiveness of public participation, promote environmental awareness and achieve good system usability.",2,2,480,506,Business; Environmental impact assessment; Usability; Public participation; Outreach; Geographic information system; Public participation GIS; Knowledge management; Volunteered geographic information; Mobile technology,,,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi2020480 https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/2/2/480 https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/2/2/480/pdf http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi2020480 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ijgi/ijgi2.html#LeiH13 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013IJGI....2..480L/abstract http://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/2/2/480,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi2020480,10.3390/ijgi2020480,1964550796,,0,000-250-564-759-322; 005-374-785-075-748; 005-951-365-540-153; 020-240-884-700-350; 021-074-586-154-668; 023-036-742-444-209; 023-351-967-000-166; 024-795-598-011-997; 025-047-211-130-303; 028-122-115-433-503; 029-083-773-134-799; 029-263-057-554-467; 031-543-330-805-238; 032-903-495-847-439; 034-296-402-405-270; 039-985-452-581-251; 040-267-517-107-219; 042-300-428-446-803; 047-100-212-874-054; 051-672-609-357-192; 057-024-302-569-644; 064-698-573-941-895; 066-336-138-162-728; 068-302-075-822-772; 072-457-178-123-625; 075-814-645-082-482; 077-662-771-853-906; 078-189-949-931-437; 081-694-463-561-523; 085-290-775-557-122; 085-692-657-558-29X; 088-339-711-439-200; 091-129-566-033-628; 100-635-968-014-055; 102-160-469-693-977; 103-859-285-040-344; 106-210-276-466-055; 117-041-969-276-339; 122-803-751-198-816; 130-700-123-619-585; 131-356-259-197-779; 135-360-535-210-851; 144-141-159-262-506; 146-556-639-124-994; 147-539-342-970-008; 153-940-799-073-233; 158-847-532-778-731; 171-544-875-588-246; 187-707-866-125-092; 188-678-650-340-531,11,,(doi) 10.3390/ijgi2020480; (magid) 1964550796; (coreid) 28158226,en

We outline a research design that addresses problems of data quality relating to credibility in volunteered geographic information (VGI) intended for Web-enabled participatory planning. Here we have drawn on a dual notion of credibility in VGI data, and propose a methodological workflow to address its criteria. We propose a ‘super-positional’ model of urban community formations, and report on the combination of quantitative and participatory methods employed to underpin its integration. The objective of this methodological phase of study is to enhance confidence in the quality of data for Web-enabled participatory planning. Our participatory method has been supported by rigorous quantification of area characteristics, including participant communities’ demographic and socio-economic contexts. This participatory method provided participants with a ready and accessible format for observing and mark-making, which allowed the investigators to iterate rapidly a system design based on participants’ responses to the workshop tasks. Participatory workshops have involved secondary school-age children in socio-economically contrasting areas of Liverpool (Merseyside, UK), which offers a test-bed for comparing communities’ formations in comparative contexts, while bringing an under-represented section of the population into a planning domain, whose experience may stem from public and non-motorised transport modalities. Data has been gathered through one-day participatory workshops, featuring questionnaire surveys, local site analysis, perception mapping and brief, textual descriptions. This innovative approach will support Web-based participation among stakeholding planners, who may benefit from well-structured, community-volunteered, geo-located definitions of local spaces.</jats:p>",1,2,88,100,Workflow; Geography; Data quality; Credibility; Participatory planning; Population; Participatory GIS; Urban planning; Knowledge management; Volunteered geographic information,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/cog/urbpla/v1y2016i2p88-100.html https://www.cogitatiopress.com/urbanplanning/article/download/620/620 https://doaj.org/article/fb0a48fe42654c8aa429aba654ff33bc https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1502198/ https://www.cogitatiopress.com/ojs/index.php/urbanplanning/article/view/620 https://econpapers.repec.org/article/cogurbpla/v_3a1_3ay_3a2016_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a88-100.htm https://www.cogitatiopress.com/urbanplanning/article/view/620,http://dx.doi.org/10.17645/up.v1i2.620,10.17645/up.v1i2.620,2468759521,,0,005-068-080-005-314; 006-808-409-284-484; 007-128-130-801-787; 010-481-003-462-765; 018-120-814-872-466; 018-434-225-983-549; 020-240-884-700-350; 020-249-499-894-225; 030-199-331-827-336; 030-437-849-233-701; 035-833-607-320-884; 036-616-049-977-19X; 040-267-517-107-219; 045-001-039-498-000; 051-594-817-063-622; 054-588-464-040-799; 057-545-918-303-995; 057-816-233-197-837; 059-532-564-128-842; 060-038-965-642-318; 078-256-516-793-70X; 104-678-900-449-250; 118-257-879-409-360; 124-925-511-021-606; 129-078-719-122-278; 130-651-394-075-884; 130-903-958-189-042; 136-026-764-617-658; 153-251-364-834-079; 168-474-982-640-629; 169-004-007-623-620; 172-123-165-655-169; 177-218-453-598-887; 189-197-904-880-554,2,,(magid) 2468759521; (doi) 10.17645/up.v1i2.620,en

Griffith; Geoffrey J. Hay,"<jats:p>The objective of this study is to evaluate operational methods for creating a particular type of urban vegetation map—one focused on vegetation over rooftops (VOR), specifically trees that extend over urban residential buildings. A key constraint was the use of passive remote sensing data only. To achieve this, we (1) conduct a review of the urban remote sensing vegetation classification literature, and we then (2) discuss methods to derive a detailed map of VOR for a study area in Calgary, Alberta, Canada from a late season, high-resolution airborne orthomosaic based on an integration of Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA), pre-classification filtering of image-objects using Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI), and a machine learning classifier. Pre-classification filtering lowered the computational burden of classification by reducing the number of input objects by 14%. Accuracy assessment results show that, despite the presence of senescing vegetation with low vegetation index values and deep shadows, classification using a small number of image-object spectral attributes as classification features (n = 9) had similar overall accuracy (88.5%) to a much more complex classification (91.8%) comprising a comprehensive set of spectral, texture, and spatial attributes as classification features (n = 86). This research provides an example of the very specific questions answerable about precise urban locations using a combination of high-resolution passive imagery and freely available VGI data. It highlights the benefits of pre-classification filtering and the judicious selection of features from image-object attributes to reduce processing load without sacrificing classification accuracy.</jats:p>",7,12,462,,Filter (signal processing); Vegetation; Learning classifier system; Urban forestry; Vegetation remote sensing; Geographic object; Late season; Computer science; Volunteered geographic information; Cartography,,,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/7/12/462 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ijgi/ijgi7.html#GriffithH18 https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi7120462 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20193507074 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018IJGI....7..462G/abstract https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/7/12/462/pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi7120462,10.3390/ijgi7120462,2902463896,,0,001-051-203-358-966; 003-300-345-175-61X; 004-500-103-436-146; 006-101-714-460-131; 006-976-274-921-142; 006-989-349-456-146; 007-413-242-570-883; 008-503-322-522-262; 010-432-916-951-60X; 011-023-806-682-866; 014-740-466-346-444; 015-878-733-366-318; 019-416-334-623-558; 023-273-382-773-947; 024-956-796-791-546; 025-007-896-595-042; 025-048-901-444-806; 026-770-395-106-584; 027-390-919-983-038; 034-108-379-192-711; 037-468-524-299-581; 038-440-230-946-642; 039-105-618-105-485; 043-545-143-284-662; 044-604-999-183-889; 045-463-467-603-846; 046-358-521-050-341; 050-936-107-834-163; 053-719-873-020-626; 053-735-383-889-206; 056-003-334-196-134; 056-137-049-762-647; 056-931-881-225-995; 057-069-873-592-580; 058-813-759-469-510; 063-952-125-605-921; 064-271-162-218-106; 068-197-098-236-491; 077-811-957-352-436; 078-674-627-243-788; 078-764-143-627-143; 079-117-605-176-945; 079-539-834-454-101; 082-363-135-647-096; 098-817-737-263-49X; 105-731-269-177-711; 109-298-758-985-817; 112-580-833-724-703; 115-536-052-388-138; 119-764-783-902-583; 123-283-774-510-411; 128-942-106-527-849; 138-185-018-055-615; 140-106-519-889-574; 142-470-018-852-435; 147-163-944-995-699; 153-211-502-069-824; 157-429-685-377-930; 157-602-349-934-052,5,,(magid) 2902463896; (doi) 10.3390/ijgi7120462,en

Stevens; Dirk U. Pfeiffer,"During the last 30years it has become commonplace for epidemiological studies to collect locational attributes of disease data. Although this advancement was driven largely by the introduction of handheld global positioning systems (GPS), and more recently, smartphones and tablets with built-in GPS, the collection of georeferenced disease data has moved beyond the use of handheld GPS devices and there now exist numerous sources of crowdsourced georeferenced disease data such as that available from georeferencing of Google search queries or Twitter messages. In addition, cartography has moved beyond the realm of professionals to crowdsourced mapping projects that play a crucial role in disease control and surveillance of outbreaks such as the 2014 West Africa Ebola epidemic. This paper provides a comprehensive review of a range of innovative sources of spatial animal and human health data including data warehouses, mHealth, Google Earth, volunteered geographic information and mining of internet-based big data sources such as Google and Twitter.

Illustrating this situation, recently, a number of studies attempted to use LBSN data (e.g., Foursquare check-ins) to investigate patterns of human travel and activity. Of particular note is that compared to other individual-level characteristics of users, such as age, profession, education, income and so forth, gender is relatively highly available in the profiles of Foursquare users. Moreover, considering gender differences in travel and activity analysis is a popular research topic and is helpful in better understanding the changes in women’s roles in family, labor force participation, society and so forth. Therefore, this paper empirically investigates how gender influences the travel and activity patterns of active local Foursquare users in New York City. Empirical investigations of gender differences in travel and activity patterns are conducted at both the individual and aggregate level. The empirical results reveal that there are gender differences in the travel and activity patterns of active local users in New York City at both the individual and aggregate level. Finally, the results of the empirical study and the extent to which LBSN data can be exploited to produce travel diary data are discussed",4,3,1512,1529,Advertising; Empirical research; Travel behavior; Survey data collection; Geography; Aggregate level; Social media; Volunteered geographic information; High availability; Social network,,,,,https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/6490523 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ijgi/ijgi4.html#SunL15 https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi4031512 https://core.ac.uk/display/90101219 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015IJGI....4.1512S/abstract https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/4/3/1512 https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/4/3/1512/pdf https://doaj.org/article/7eb50aa5f54344e9adaec813bf786fa7 https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi4031512,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi4031512,10.3390/ijgi4031512,2129298407,,0,004-423-410-959-493; 013-644-273-796-75X; 016-768-393-395-751; 018-320-455-212-605; 020-878-732-084-221; 026-784-048-034-00X; 027-357-442-747-550; 027-971-006-067-065; 028-503-029-071-189; 029-708-553-202-304; 031-767-735-451-856; 031-957-783-380-682; 032-167-178-618-736; 036-465-522-051-531; 038-559-656-082-325; 041-722-088-664-946; 053-643-843-599-704; 054-593-188-789-328; 055-406-190-799-330; 057-586-071-243-253; 061-286-603-092-434; 065-968-814-206-861; 075-909-574-295-166; 083-345-645-020-792; 086-098-910-686-290; 094-518-642-203-069; 104-127-606-020-305; 111-380-257-141-290; 112-325-364-706-730; 116-435-985-920-863; 122-919-578-692-099; 150-892-284-828-278; 164-530-168-241-533; 166-825-525-742-59X,18,,(magid) 2129298407; (doi) 10.3390/ijgi4031512; (coreid) 90101219,en

Un-Ggim National Approach,2016-06-14,2016,journal article,"ISPRS - International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences",21949034,Copernicus GmbH,,A. Arozarena; G. Villa; N. Valcárcel; B. Pérez,"Abstract. Remote sensing satellites, together with aerial and terrestrial platforms (mobile and fixed), produce nowadays huge amounts of data coming from a wide variety of sensors. These datasets serve as main data sources for the extraction of Geospatial Reference Information (GRI), constituting the “skeleton” of any Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI). Since very different situations can be found around the world in terms of geographic information production and management, the generation of global GRI datasets seems extremely challenging. Remotely sensed data, due to its wide availability nowadays, is able to provide fundamental sources for any production or management system present in different countries. After several automatic and semiautomatic processes including ancillary data, the extracted geospatial information is ready to become part of the GRI databases. In order to optimize these data flows for the production of high quality geospatial information and to promote its use to address global challenges several initiatives at national, continental and global levels have been put in place, such as European INSPIRE initiative and Copernicus Programme, and global initiatives such as the Group on Earth Observation/Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEO/GEOSS) and United Nations Global Geospatial Information Management (UN-GGIM). These workflows are established mainly by public organizations, with the adequate institutional arrangements at national, regional or global levels. Other initiatives, such as Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI), on the other hand may contribute to maintain the GRI databases updated. Remotely sensed data hence becomes one of the main pillars underpinning the establishment of a global SDI, as those datasets will be used by public agencies or institutions as well as by volunteers to extract the required spatial information that in turn will feed the GRI databases. This paper intends to provide an example of how institutional arrangements and cooperative production systems can be set up at any territorial level in order to exploit remotely sensed data in the most intensive manner, taking advantage of all its potential.",XLI-B4,,721,725,Workflow; Spatial data infrastructure; Global Earth Observation System of Systems; Management system; Geography; Data science; Ancillary data; Earth observation; Volunteered geographic information; Database; Geospatial analysis,,,,,http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ISPAr41B4..721A/abstract https://noa.gwlb.de/receive/cop_mods_00012524 https://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/XLI-B4/721/2016/ http://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/XLI-B4/721/2016/isprs-archives-XLI-B4-721-2016.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-xli-b4-721-2016,10.5194/isprs-archives-xli-b4-721-2016,2432243244,,0,038-610-306-635-656,1,,(doi) 10.5194/isprs-archives-xli-b4-721-2016; (magid) 2432243244; (coreid) 91121269,en
015-191-212-706-128,Dynamically Integrating OSM Data into a Borderland Database,2015-09-08,2015,journal article,ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information,22209964,MDPI AG,Switzerland,Xiaoguang Zhou; Lu Zeng; Yu Jiang; Kaixuan Zhou; Yijiang Zhao,"Spatial data are fundamental for borderland analyses of geography, natural resources, demography, politics, economy, and culture. As the spatial data used in borderland research usually cover the borderland regions of several neighboring countries, it is difficult for anyone research institution of government to collect them. Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) is a highly successful method for acquiring timely and detailed global spatial data at a very low cost. Therefore, VGI is a reasonable source of borderland spatial data. OpenStreetMap (OSM) is known as the most successful VGI resource. However, OSM's data model is far different from the traditional geographic information model. Thus, the OSM data must be converted in the scientist’s customized data model. Because the real world changes rapidly, the converted data must be updated incrementally. Therefore, this paper presents a method used to dynamically integrate OSM data into the borderland database. In this method, a basic transformation rule base is formed by comparing the OSM Map Feature description document and the destination model definitions. Using the basic rules, the main features can be automatically converted to the destination model. A human-computer interaction model transformation and a rule/automatic-remember mechanism are developed to interactively transfer the unusual features that cannot be transferred by the basic rules to the target model and to remember the reusable rules automatically. To keep the borderland database current, the global OsmChange daily diff file is used to extract the change-only information for the research region. To extract the changed objects in the region under study, the relationship between the changed object and the research region is analyzed considering the evolution of the involved objects. In addition, five rules are determined to select the objects and integrate the changed objects with multi-versions over time. The objects’ change-type evolution is analyzed, and seven rules are used to determine the change-type of the changed objects. Based on these rules and algorithms, we programmed an automatic (or semi-automatic) integrating and updating prototype system for the borderland database. The developed system was intensively tested using OSM data for Vietnam and Pakistan as the experimental data.",4,3,1707,1728,Data mining; Spatial analysis; Geography; Information model; Model transformation; Feature description; Experimental data; Volunteered geographic information; Database; Data model,,,,National Science Foundation of China,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ijgi/ijgi4.html#ZhouZJZZ15 https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi4031707 https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/4/3/1707/pdf https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/4/3/1707/htm https://core.ac.uk/display/89526882 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015IJGI....4.1707Z/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi4031707,10.3390/ijgi4031707,1910465634,,0,007-684-128-166-136; 008-714-358-699-609; 011-165-874-683-362; 013-803-494-618-557; 016-094-457-528-43X; 017-008-646-646-77X; 020-910-316-459-423; 027-736-997-184-595; 028-739-825-417-25X; 030-217-575-405-566; 030-416-570-557-01X; 032-353-715-439-039; 038-976-596-179-447; 045-112-601-466-05X; 046-082-447-805-261; 073-471-291-645-422; 088-339-711-439-200; 088-431-364-816-236; 097-612-174-011-049; 098-565-405-790-308; 103-859-285-040-344; 117-344-521-489-051; 138-847-225-776-212; 145-332-171-038-142; 147-185-945-796-509; 147-213-981-170-541; 150-441-650-870-124; 152-980-324-742-114; 158-847-532-778-731; 197-484-423-362-301,7,,(doi) 10.3390/ijgi4031707; (coreid) 89526882; (magid) 1910465634,en
015-229-443-215-079,A conceptual model of the automated credibility assessment of the volunteered geographic information,2014-02-25,2014,journal article,IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science,17551315,IOP Publishing,,Nurul Hawani Idris; Mike Jackson; Mohamad Hafis Izran Ishak,"The use of Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) in collecting, sharing and disseminating geospatially referenced information on the Web is increasingly common. The potentials of this localized and collective information have been seen to complement the maintenance process of authoritative mapping data sources and in realizing the development of Digital Earth. The main barrier to the use of this data in supporting this bottom up approach is the credibility (trust), completeness, accuracy, and quality of both the data input and outputs generated. The only feasible approach to assess these data is by relying on an automated process. This paper describes a conceptual model of indicators (parameters) and practical approaches to automated assess the credibility of information contributed through the VGI including map mashups, Geo Web and crowd – sourced based applications. There are two main components proposed to be assessed in the conceptual model – metadata and data. The metadata component comprises the indicator of the hosting (websites) and the sources of data / information. The data component comprises the indicators to assess absolute and relative data positioning, attribute, thematic, temporal and geometric correctness and consistency.

Taiwan is geographically situated in a subtropical climate zone which is deemed as a future model of Japanese climate if global warming continues. It is therefore advantageous for Japanese to know the present IAQ (Indoor Air Quality) situations in Taiwan. The research was carried out in two phases. The first phase used questionnaire surveys to collect the relevant information of the occupants and their living environments, and QEESI questionnaires (Chinese version) for information regarding their health conditions. In the second phase, IAQ measurements were conducted in the 40 houses which were selected among volunteers of the first survey. Measurement items were temperature, humidity and concentrations of carbonyl compounds and VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds). Verification measurements were conducted to investigate the hypothesis in the two houses, A and B, selected from 40 measured houses. The amount of furnishing materials in the two houses was quite different. Finally, the questionnaire results, QEESI (Quick Exposure Sensitivity Inventory) scores, and IAQ data were compared accordingly to determine the factors that cause SHS (Sick House Syndrome). The results are as follows. 1. For areas deficient in SHS and/or MCS (Multiple Chemical Sensitivity) diagnoses, combining QEESI investigations and IAQ measurements in the surveys is successful in screening SH and discovering SHS. 2. To reduce indoor air pollution effectively, it is insufficient just to regulate the materials and the quantity of interior furnishings.

M. Yagoub,"<jats:p>Abstract. The number of smart phones that are supported by location facility like Global Positioning System (GPS), Camera and connected to the internet has increased sharply in UAE during the last five years. This increase offers a chance to capitalize on using these devices as resources for data collection, therefore reducing cost. In many cases specific events may happen in areas or at time where there may be no governmental departments to collect such unrepeated events. The current research will showcase various studies that had been conducted on Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) debating various aspects such as accuracy, legal issues, and privacy. This research will also integrate Geographic Information System (GIS), VGI, social media tools, data mining, and mobile technology to design a conceptual framework for promoting public participation in UAE. The data gathered through survey will be helpful in correlating various aspects of VGI. Since there are diverse views about these aspects, policy makers are left undecided in many countries about how to deal with VGI. The assessment of the UAE case will contribute to the age-long debate by examining the willingness of the public to participate. The result will show the public perception to be as sensors for data collection. Additionally, the potential of citizen involvement in the risk and disaster management process by providing voluntary data collected for VGI applications will also be explored in the paper.;                     </jats:p>",II-2/W2,,241,246,Data collection; Conceptual framework; Business; Public participation; Geographic information system; Social media; Knowledge management; Volunteered geographic information; Mobile technology; Emergency management,,,,,https://doaj.org/article/aed0d95417d84ac1a7c8f1220410d0a7 https://noa.gwlb.de/receive/cop_mods_00015012 https://www.isprs-ann-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/II-2-W2/241/2015/ https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ISPAnII22..241Y/abstract https://www.isprs-ann-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/II-2-W2/241/2015/isprsannals-II-2-W2-241-2015.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/isprsannals-ii-2-w2-241-2015,10.5194/isprsannals-ii-2-w2-241-2015,2217719320,,0,009-761-825-640-496; 014-766-622-667-692; 017-204-370-357-157; 017-614-610-102-13X; 022-807-913-135-942; 023-036-742-444-209; 024-338-521-176-925; 025-047-211-130-303; 027-736-997-184-595; 036-706-466-669-656; 037-516-439-065-864; 037-995-494-910-689; 039-985-452-581-251; 040-267-517-107-219; 055-406-393-188-599; 057-545-918-303-995; 066-082-447-846-333; 069-287-151-830-20X; 071-547-407-522-754; 072-243-912-426-29X; 072-565-651-741-049; 084-030-072-516-335; 095-607-318-877-177; 099-636-496-379-523; 135-360-535-210-851; 136-964-216-456-786; 143-842-605-126-885; 169-004-007-623-620,2,,(magid) 2217719320; (doi) 10.5194/isprsannals-ii-2-w2-241-2015; (coreid) 91777920,en

This paper situates the origins of these practices, phenomena and concepts within the intersection of Web 2.0 and emerging online and mobile spatial technologies, herein called the GeoWeb 2.0. The significance of these origins is akin to a revolution in the way information is created, curated and distributed, attributed with transformative social impacts. Applications for environmental sustainability have the potential to be similarly transformative or disruptive. However, Web 2.0 is  not described or conceptualised consistently within the literature. Australian examples implementing the GeoWeb 2.0 for environmental sustainability are diverse, but the  reasons for this are difficult to ascertain. There is little published by the creators of such applications on their decisions, and Australian research is nascent, occurring across a variety of disciplinary approaches. While a substantial research literature emanates from North America and Europe, its transferability to Australia requires careful assessment. This paper contributes to this assessment by providing a review of relevant literature in the context of Australian examples for environmental sustainability",3,3,1058,1076,Data mining; Web 2.0; Geography; Data science; Geoweb; Social media; Volunteered geographic information; Crowdsourcing; Sustainability; Transformative learning; Discipline,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ijgi/ijgi3.html#Clark14 http://core.ac.uk/display/26760460 https://core.ac.uk/display/26760460 https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi3031058 http://ecite.utas.edu.au/95060/1/Alister%20Clark%20Web%202.0%20ISPRS%202014.pdf https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/3/3/1058/pdf https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/3/3/1058/htm http://ecite.utas.edu.au/95060,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi3031058,10.3390/ijgi3031058,2074329167,,0,002-289-130-158-571; 006-056-479-692-521; 010-124-276-579-39X; 011-854-399-312-637; 015-779-846-575-85X; 017-194-800-561-718; 018-605-873-196-838; 020-749-054-636-988; 023-351-967-000-166; 023-405-993-854-289; 024-403-212-152-856; 030-549-074-065-808; 031-693-310-151-111; 032-903-495-847-439; 033-430-338-271-463; 035-161-913-145-763; 039-426-638-357-900; 046-000-407-319-312; 046-509-496-371-690; 047-100-212-874-054; 048-086-127-356-891; 050-297-031-867-816; 051-672-609-357-192; 052-015-360-863-204; 052-805-326-187-771; 052-950-499-532-001; 057-545-918-303-995; 058-444-759-259-280; 058-445-730-367-370; 060-249-371-586-064; 062-117-558-916-156; 063-599-343-217-316; 064-233-222-690-967; 066-101-498-522-68X; 066-336-138-162-728; 068-014-894-174-75X; 070-574-656-763-695; 071-670-977-318-011; 072-425-953-553-022; 076-483-968-109-005; 080-439-924-842-869; 082-366-214-673-579; 091-512-177-185-582; 097-612-174-011-049; 100-866-038-545-202; 109-099-478-458-367; 111-066-714-236-741; 114-473-425-210-091; 117-299-663-684-83X; 117-378-186-528-601; 121-362-424-776-810; 122-151-014-222-395; 129-506-796-807-623; 130-503-286-026-714; 131-356-259-197-779; 135-360-535-210-851; 137-094-259-166-471; 138-673-529-421-480; 143-418-487-287-596; 144-540-995-873-327; 145-263-899-246-589; 148-792-749-744-518; 150-102-924-082-031; 153-244-244-790-424; 162-141-951-358-694; 169-004-007-623-620; 179-017-476-148-936; 185-252-823-212-777; 185-390-364-801-737; 186-902-101-981-003; 188-678-650-340-531; 195-019-623-135-107; 198-353-026-453-45X,6,,(coreid) 26760460; (magid) 2074329167; (doi) 10.3390/ijgi3031058,en

Wilson; Michela Bertolotto,"Volunteered geographic information VGI is generated by heterogenous ‘information communities’ that co-operate to produce reusable units of geographic knowledge. A consensual lexicon is a key factor to enable this open production model. Lexical definitions help demarcate the boundaries of terms, forming a thin semantic ground on which knowledge can travel. In VGI, lexical definitions often appear to be inconsistent, circular, noisy and highly idiosyncratic. Computing the semantic similarity of these ‘volunteered lexical definitions’ has a wide range of applications in GIScience, including information retrieval, data mining and information integration. This article describes a knowledge-based approach to quantify the semantic similarity of lexical definitions. Grounded in the recursive intuition that similar terms are described using similar terms, the approach relies on paraphrase-detection techniques and the lexical database WordNet. The cognitive plausibility of the approach is evaluated in the context of the OpenStreetMap OSM Semantic Network, obtaining high correlation with human judgements.

016-961-239-654-609,Supervised Classification of Built-Up Areas in Sub-Saharan African Cities Using Landsat Imagery and OpenStreetMap,2018-07-20,2018,journal article,Remote Sensing,20724292,MDPI AG,Switzerland,Yann Forget; Catherine Linard; Marius Gilbert,"<jats:p>The Landsat archives have been made freely available in 2008, allowing the production of high resolution built-up maps at the regional or global scale. In this context, most of the classification algorithms rely on supervised learning to tackle the heterogeneity of the urban environments. However, at a large scale, the process of collecting training samples becomes a huge project in itself. This leads to a growing interest from the remote sensing community toward Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) projects such as OpenStreetMap (OSM). Despite the spatial heterogeneity of its contribution patterns, OSM provides an increasing amount of information on the earth’s surface. More interestingly, the community has moved beyond street mapping to collect a wider range of spatial data such as building footprints, land use, or points of interest. In this paper, we propose a classification method that makes use of OSM to automatically collect training samples for supervised learning of built-up areas. To take into account a wide range of potential issues, the approach is assessed in ten Sub-Saharan African urban areas from various demographic profiles and climates. The obtained results are compared with: (1) existing high resolution global urban maps such as the Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) or the Human Built-up and Settlements Extent (HBASE); and (2) a supervised classification based on manually digitized training samples. The results suggest that automated supervised classifications based on OSM can provide performances similar to manual approaches, provided that OSM training samples are sufficiently available and correctly pre-processed. Moreover, the proposed method could reach better results in the near future, given the increasing amount and variety of information in the OSM database.</jats:p>",10,7,1145,,Geography; Sub saharan; Cartography,,,,Belgian Federal Science Policy Office,https://difusion.ulb.ac.be/vufind/Record/ULB-DIPOT:oai:dipot.ulb.ac.be:2013/275616/Holdings https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/remotesensing/remotesensing10.html#ForgetLG18 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018RemS...10.1145F/abstract https://doi.org/10.3390/rs10071145,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs10071145,10.3390/rs10071145,2883240105,,0,000-280-632-517-884; 002-283-643-240-063; 006-029-924-892-254; 006-101-714-460-131; 007-654-760-698-454; 018-732-885-687-353; 018-806-660-341-174; 024-111-887-416-165; 027-491-987-638-52X; 035-505-955-036-940; 040-215-238-362-650; 041-145-809-894-139; 042-593-973-586-483; 044-636-840-890-035; 050-550-068-666-512; 051-638-394-711-190; 054-724-566-732-335; 056-931-881-225-995; 057-545-918-303-995; 063-645-389-904-941; 064-794-917-153-64X; 069-399-089-800-603; 072-104-186-976-093; 075-359-691-361-886; 083-815-629-123-031; 084-651-897-204-792; 106-264-944-278-433; 130-069-374-448-854; 152-288-948-664-256; 166-713-161-186-468; 171-043-332-359-206; 179-575-801-974-235; 185-589-661-099-292; 191-908-920-467-938,8,,(doi) 10.3390/rs10071145; (magid) 2883240105,fr; en

Florczyk; Christina Corbane; Thomas Kemper,"<jats:p>The Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) produces new global spatial information, evidence-based analytics describing the human presence on the planet that is based mainly on two quantitative factors: (i) the spatial distribution (density) of built-up structures and (ii) the spatial distribution (density) of resident people. Both of the factors are observed in the long-term temporal domain and per unit area, in order to support the analysis of the trends and indicators for monitoring the implementation of the 2030 Development Agenda and the related thematic agreements. The GHSL uses various input data, including global, multi-temporal archives of high-resolution satellite imagery, census data, and volunteered geographic information. In this paper, we present a global estimate for the Land Use Efficiency (LUE) indicator—SDG 11.3.1, for circa 10,000 urban centers, calculating the ratio of land consumption rate to population growth rate between 1990 and 2015. In addition, we analyze the characteristics of the GHSL information to demonstrate how the original frameworks of data (gridded GHSL data) and tools (GHSL tools suite), developed from Earth Observation and integrated with census information, could support Sustainable Development Goals monitoring. In particular, we demonstrate the potential of gridded, open and free, local yet globally consistent, multi-temporal data in filling the data gap for Sustainable Development Goal 11. The results of our research demonstrate that there is potential to raise SDG 11.3.1 from a Tier II classification (manifesting unavailability of data) to a Tier I, as GHSL provides a global baseline for the essential variables called by the SDG 11.3.1 metadata.</jats:p>",8,2,96,,Environmental resource management; Spatial analysis; Earth observation; Computer science; Land use; Sustainable development; Volunteered geographic information; Analytics; Metadata; Thematic map,,,,Directorate-General for Regional Policy,https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/8/2/96/pdf http://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/8/2/96 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019IJGI....8...96M/abstract http://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC115812 https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi8020096 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ijgi/ijgi8.html#MelchiorriPFCK19 https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/8/2/96/htm,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi8020096,10.3390/ijgi8020096,2895460600,,0,002-283-643-240-063; 002-635-365-649-198; 002-761-034-548-592; 006-776-900-954-480; 008-226-856-754-639; 026-107-179-509-492; 029-119-118-568-12X; 033-002-613-024-264; 036-420-813-505-231; 036-780-227-131-424; 037-878-446-368-706; 039-962-440-908-198; 041-499-840-246-883; 041-761-410-011-380; 041-784-551-695-44X; 043-544-360-093-462; 044-692-271-386-707; 050-175-491-336-930; 051-797-585-194-649; 058-084-011-973-496; 069-576-269-975-907; 069-814-570-041-514; 070-775-583-834-173; 104-115-412-837-909; 104-590-179-403-954; 118-220-225-147-411; 132-492-536-863-34X; 186-722-163-571-976; 187-175-217-291-600,23,,(magid) 2895460600; (doi) 10.3390/ijgi8020096,en

Camargo; Scott A. Hale; Graham McNeill; Sridhar Raman,"<jats:p>Accurate understanding and forecasting of traffic conditions is a key contemporary problem for local policymakers. Road networks are increasingly congested, yet data on usage patterns is often scarce or expensive to obtain, meaning that informed policy decision-making is difficult. This paper explores the extent to which traffic disruption can be estimated from static features of the volunteer geographic information site OpenStreetMap [OSM]. Kernel Density Estimates of OSM features are used as predictors for a linear regression of counts of traffic incidents at 6,500 separate points within the Oxfordshire road traffic network. For highly granular points of just 10m2, it is shown that more than half of variation in traffic outcomes can be explained with these static features alone. Furthermore, use of OSM’s granular point of interest data improves considerably on more aggregate categories which are typically used in studies of transportation and land use. Although the estimations are by no means perfect, they offer a good baseline model considering the data is free to obtain and easy to process.</jats:p>",,,252,252,Point of interest; Transport engineering; Open data; Baseline model; Computer science; Land use; Linear regression; Social media; Kernel density estimation; Big data,,,,,https://riunet.upv.es/handle/10251/111828 http://ocs.editorial.upv.es/index.php/CARMA/CARMA2018/paper/view/8319 http://ocs.editorial.upv.es/index.php/CARMA/CARMA2018/paper/download/8319/4301,http://dx.doi.org/10.4995/carma2018.2018.8319,10.4995/carma2018.2018.8319,2964278703,,0,,1,,(magid) 2964278703; (doi) 10.4995/carma2018.2018.8319,en; es

Foody; Flavio Lupia,"Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) represents a growing source of potentially valuable data for many applications, including land cover map validation. It is still an emerging field and many different approaches can be used to take value from VGI, but   also many pros and cons are related to its use. Therefore, since it is timely to get an overview of the subject, the aim of this article is to review the use of VGI as reference data for land cover map validation. The main platforms and types of VGI that are used and which are potentially useful are analysed. Since quality is a fundamental issue in map validation, the quality procedures used by the platforms that collect VGI to increase and control data quality are reviewed and a framework for addressing VGI quality assessment is proposed. A review of cases where VGI was used as an additional data source to assist in map validation is made, as well as cases where only VGI was used, indicating the procedures used to assess VGI quality and fitness for use. A discussion and some conclusions are drawn on best practices, future potential and the challenges of the use of VGI for land cover map validation",29,7,1269,1291,Data mining; Usability; Best practice; Geography; Data science; Land cover; Data source; Control data; Land use; Volunteered geographic information; Crowdsourcing,,,,,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13658816.2015.1018266 http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/11412/ https://core.ac.uk/display/33576078 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20153330372 https://research.aston.ac.uk/en/publications/usability-of-vgi-for-validation-of-land-cover-maps https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13658816.2015.1018266 http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/32270/ https://doi.org/10.1080/13658816.2015.1018266 http://publications.aston.ac.uk/25411/ https://research.aston.ac.uk/portal/en/researchoutput/usability-of-vgi-for-validation-of-land-cover-maps(68c41545-6d52-4dee-95b2-45eb87458197)/export.html http://eprints.aston.ac.uk/25411/ https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/gis/gis29.html#FonteBSFL15,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13658816.2015.1018266,10.1080/13658816.2015.1018266,2035563469,,0,002-555-907-164-663; 004-039-894-146-408; 004-323-536-155-45X; 007-167-752-523-613; 007-351-365-423-145; 007-857-101-229-718; 008-655-662-451-459; 009-095-552-623-989; 011-675-217-913-914; 011-963-649-815-476; 014-818-480-999-908; 017-158-297-230-285; 017-695-753-475-803; 018-663-572-986-479; 018-923-819-294-430; 019-362-199-226-515; 020-462-939-307-024; 022-473-450-579-960; 026-645-756-189-301; 027-736-997-184-595; 029-610-127-775-454; 030-288-818-839-624; 033-753-266-989-199; 036-431-775-434-754; 037-643-751-932-944; 040-267-517-107-219; 041-490-320-644-385; 043-895-959-690-583; 044-797-289-906-273; 050-539-693-523-843; 050-772-928-369-643; 053-620-292-475-147; 053-660-296-625-989; 057-545-918-303-995; 059-813-324-446-295; 061-714-530-294-745; 063-392-296-214-893; 069-048-542-531-065; 071-165-077-549-626; 072-104-186-976-093; 073-989-332-674-833; 075-796-006-914-012; 080-876-313-821-378; 083-146-674-983-203; 083-815-629-123-031; 085-739-816-948-283; 091-204-512-390-272; 093-331-665-752-187; 094-493-112-438-794; 097-338-432-344-323; 097-612-174-011-049; 099-021-290-878-668; 100-061-368-250-820; 101-411-459-548-802; 102-160-469-693-977; 111-302-370-584-057; 119-056-628-159-542; 124-043-027-110-303; 134-427-932-080-146; 136-570-589-999-562; 141-047-060-911-705; 142-867-773-436-799; 144-096-391-736-702; 161-072-580-272-396; 168-453-915-518-954; 171-544-875-588-246; 197-866-181-140-194,64,,(magid) 2035563469; (doi) 10.1080/13658816.2015.1018266; (coreid) 141273152,en

Bégin; Rodolphe Devillers; Stéphane Roche,"<jats:p>Abstract. VGI changed the mapping landscape by allowing people that are not professional cartographers to contribute to large mapping projects, resulting at the same time in concerns about the quality of the data produced. While a number of early VGI studies used conventional methods to assess data quality, such approaches are not always well adapted to VGI. Since VGI is a user-generated content, we posit that features and places mapped by contributors largely reflect contributors’ personal interests. This paper proposes studying contributors’ mapping processes to understand the characteristics and quality of the data produced. We argue that contributors’ behaviour when mapping reflects contributors’ motivation and individual preferences in selecting mapped features and delineating mapped areas. Such knowledge of contributors’ behaviour could allow for the derivation of information about the quality of VGI datasets. This approach was tested using a sample area from OpenStreetMap, leading to a better understanding of data completeness for contributor’s preferred features.;                     </jats:p>",XL-2/W1,1,149,154,Geography; Information retrieval; Data quality; Sample area; Volunteered geographic information,,,,,http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ISPAr.XL2a.149B/abstract https://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/XL-2-W1/149/2013/isprsarchives-XL-2-W1-149-2013.pdf https://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/XL-2-W1/149/2013/,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/isprsarchives-xl-2-w1-149-2013,10.5194/isprsarchives-xl-2-w1-149-2013,2167855612,,0,000-245-937-639-328; 006-057-019-890-636; 008-714-358-699-609; 012-563-149-230-301; 015-682-464-559-538; 022-473-450-579-960; 026-645-756-189-301; 027-277-768-551-574; 030-217-575-405-566; 038-976-596-179-447; 040-267-517-107-219; 041-312-632-078-632; 045-109-138-021-608; 051-285-080-856-898; 052-551-648-887-490; 057-545-918-303-995; 060-796-864-455-735; 075-869-838-337-064; 088-339-711-439-200; 091-143-618-066-204; 092-986-888-954-668; 097-338-432-344-323; 106-264-944-278-433; 137-752-484-697-713; 169-004-007-623-620; 179-017-476-148-936,29,,(doi) 10.5194/isprsarchives-xl-2-w1-149-2013; (magid) 2167855612; (coreid) 91857281,en

Cancer-related distress may be ameliorated by comprehensive preparation for treatment and addressing women's informational, physical, psychological and psychosexual needs. This paper describes the protocol for a multisite randomised controlled trial (RCT) testing a novel intervention package which combines tailored specialist nursing consultations and telephone peer support with the primary aim to reduce psychological distress. Secondary aims assess patient quality of life, symptom distress, unmet supportive care needs, preparation for treatment, psychosexual functioning and vaginal stenosis.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""METHODS/DESIGN"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">This multifaceted intervention comprises four nurse-led consultations coupled with four phone calls from a peer support volunteer (GC survivor). The evidence-based intervention will be delivered at critical points in the illness trajectory: pre-treatment, mid-treatment, treatment completion and post-treatment. Nurses and peers undergo 2-day intensive training workshops, are guided by comprehensive study intervention manuals and receive ongoing supervision and support. Eligible patients will have a diagnosis of GC, be scheduled to receive curative radiotherapy, be aged 18 years or over and speak English. Three-hundred and six participants will be randomized to receive usual care or usual care with the intervention package. Study outcome measures will be collected at baseline, day 1 of radiotherapy and 1, 6 and 12 months post radiotherapy. Clinical assessments of vaginal toxicity will occur at baseline, and 3, 6, and 12 months post radiotherapy.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""DISCUSSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">This timely research has the potential to substantially reduce the physical, psychosexual and supportive care needs of women with GC. Using a telephone peer support model, the intervention package ensures equitable access to support services for geographically isolated patients. The novel intervention engages peer volunteers who liaise with nurses to encourage adherence to professionally-delivered information and provide emotional support.

018-179-737-274-679,Citizen-Centric Urban Planning through Extracting Emotion Information from Twitter in an Interdisciplinary Space-Time-Linguistics Algorithm,2016-07-05,2016,journal article,Urban Planning,21837635,Cogitatio,,Bernd Resch; Anja Summa; Peter Zeile; Michael Strube,"<jats:p>Traditional urban planning processes typically happen in offices and behind desks. Modern types of civic participation can enhance those processes by acquiring citizens’ ideas and feedback in participatory sensing approaches like “People as Sensors”. As such, citizen-centric planning can be achieved by analysing Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) data such as Twitter tweets and posts from other social media channels. These user-generated data comprise several information dimensions, such as spatial and temporal information, and textual content. However, in previous research, these dimensions were generally examined separately in single-disciplinary approaches, which does not allow for holistic conclusions in urban planning. This paper introduces TwEmLab, an interdisciplinary approach towards extracting citizens’ emotions in different locations within a city. More concretely, we analyse tweets in three dimensions (space, time, and linguistics), based on similarities between each pair of tweets as defined by a specific set of functional relationships in each dimension. We use a graph-based semi-supervised learning algorithm to classify the data into discrete emotions (happiness, sadness, fear, anger/disgust, none). Our proposed solution allows tweets to be classified into emotion classes in a multi-parametric approach. Additionally, we created a manually annotated gold standard that can be used to evaluate TwEmLab’s performance. Our experimental results show that we are able to identify tweets carrying emotions and that our approach bears extensive potential to reveal new insights into citizens’ perceptions of the city.</jats:p>",1,2,114,127,Algorithm; Geography; Happiness; Participatory sensing; Sadness; Participatory planning; Linguistics; Urban planning; Social media; Volunteered geographic information; Semi-supervised learning,,,,,https://doaj.org/article/9b648e6470494f11ba4f37f0fcf044a5 https://ideas.repec.org/a/cog/urbpla/v1y2016i2p114-127.html https://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/handle/document/54390 https://www.cogitatiopress.com/urbanplanning/article/download/617/617 https://core.ac.uk/display/143831991 https://www.cogitatiopress.com/urbanplanning/article/view/617 https://uni-salzburg.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/citizen-centric-urban-planning-through-extracting-emotion-informa,http://dx.doi.org/10.17645/up.v1i2.617,10.17645/up.v1i2.617,2464046665,,0,005-350-127-982-518; 006-485-547-722-530; 012-117-967-735-934; 013-905-882-538-185; 016-736-880-761-249; 024-250-992-858-248; 024-733-601-665-737; 025-420-015-711-162; 030-741-283-115-701; 033-004-661-472-327; 036-616-049-977-19X; 038-339-590-358-08X; 040-002-056-220-935; 045-201-107-411-584; 046-153-002-212-637; 049-648-174-134-552; 050-631-211-881-245; 055-066-518-911-464; 057-545-918-303-995; 062-603-591-890-895; 068-777-420-127-498; 068-849-300-251-806; 072-067-740-343-876; 081-083-341-882-940; 083-377-450-779-789; 090-283-612-169-104; 092-066-938-806-849; 096-632-113-198-366; 102-728-356-062-203; 104-889-475-186-487; 112-598-129-914-437; 113-184-876-303-935; 129-869-933-276-121; 132-341-773-424-852; 134-215-312-010-636; 135-048-246-583-647; 155-789-549-928-247; 160-878-950-435-559; 179-101-609-634-906; 181-746-944-515-197; 184-746-526-692-771; 185-174-177-617-225; 186-153-303-697-830; 194-929-887-559-09X,42,,(magid) 2464046665; (doi) 10.17645/up.v1i2.617,en

While volunteered geographic information has led to the development of accurate and inexpensive web maps, the sheer volume of data generated has created spatial information overload. This results in difficulties identifying relevant map features. Geopersonalisation, which adapts map content based on user interests offers a solution to this. The technique is especially powerful when implicit indicators of interest are used as a basis for personalisation. This article describes the design and features of VizAnalysisTools, a suite of tools to visualise and interpret users’ implicit interactions with map content. While traditional data mining techniques can be used to identify trends and preferences, visual analytics, in particular geovisual analytics, which assists the human cognition process, has proven useful in detecting interesting patterns. By identifying salient trends, areas of interest on the map become apparent. This knowledge can be used to strengthen the algorithms used for geopersonalisation.",6,4,315,332,Geovisualization; Personalization; Website architecture; Web mapping; Data science; Geoweb; Computer science; Volunteered geographic information; Visual analytics; Analytics,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/ids/ijdmmm/v6y2014i4p315-332.html http://www.nust.edu.pk/INSTITUTIONS/Schools/SCEE/Institutes/IGIS/Departments/GIS/Faculty/Documents/Journal%203.pdf https://www.inderscienceonline.com/doi/ref/10.1504/IJDMMM.2014.066761 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ijdmmm/ijdmmm6.html#TahirMB14 https://econpapers.repec.org/article/idsijdmmm/v_3a6_3ay_3a2014_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a315-332.htm,http://dx.doi.org/10.1504/ijdmmm.2014.066761,10.1504/ijdmmm.2014.066761,1979899377,,0,000-564-234-106-128; 004-369-173-412-712; 006-796-065-985-096; 013-977-027-624-747; 020-749-054-636-988; 039-331-737-803-505; 043-115-218-543-287; 049-239-056-478-912; 062-570-113-405-711; 069-959-222-705-836; 076-266-804-857-76X; 080-332-926-556-671; 083-390-104-481-847; 097-965-216-860-596; 098-070-626-786-463; 101-469-472-364-751; 129-617-889-302-087; 130-474-685-635-170; 131-945-847-411-634; 146-335-052-719-72X; 178-125-878-312-817; 180-621-485-730-676,5,,(magid) 1979899377; (doi) 10.1504/ijdmmm.2014.066761,en

We present a mean field approach to draw relationships between road network spatial attributes, the number of evacuees, and the resultant evacuation time estimate (ETE). Using volunteered geographic information, we divide 50 United Kingdom cities into a total of 704 catchment areas (CAs) which we define as an area where all agents share the same nearest exit node. 90% of the agents are within ≈6,847 m of CA exit nodes with ≈13,778 agents/CA. We establish a characteristic flow rate from catchment area attributes (population, distance to exit node, and exit node width) and a mean flow rate in a free-flow regime by simulating total evacuations using an agent based ""queuing network"" model. We use these variables to determine a relationship between catchment area attributes and resultant ETEs. This relationship could enable emergency planners to make a rapid appraisal of evacuation strategies and help support decisions in the run up to a crisis.",93,3,032311,032311,Mean flow; Catchment area; Pedestrian; Bottleneck; Population; Queuing network model; Poison control; Operations research; Volunteered geographic information,,"Emergencies; Geography; Models, Theoretical; Pedestrians; Time Factors",,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council,http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016PhRvE..93c2311K/abstract https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/ws/files/141789260/Full_text_PDF_final_published_version_.pdf https://export.arxiv.org/abs/1512.03087 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27078370 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1512.html#KunwarSJ15 https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03087 http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03087 https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03087.pdf https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/evacuation-time-estimate-for-total-pedestrian-evacuation-using-a- https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.93.032311 https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevE.93.032311,http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/physreve.93.032311,10.1103/physreve.93.032311,2196331788,,0,001-570-332-830-176; 006-286-132-527-678; 008-714-358-699-609; 016-768-185-487-467; 016-962-356-267-530; 019-039-730-132-282; 019-937-614-426-907; 022-566-649-501-493; 029-918-497-526-974; 030-983-461-828-651; 031-474-361-982-062; 038-976-596-179-447; 039-912-341-136-625; 049-014-869-917-057; 057-545-918-303-995; 057-847-336-282-956; 060-464-617-242-037; 064-186-416-748-03X; 064-253-396-019-098; 066-931-950-340-405; 070-165-365-115-922; 079-150-962-055-361; 083-671-285-473-213; 084-302-336-294-120; 097-374-046-972-266; 098-316-163-998-327; 102-408-555-869-816; 106-264-944-278-433; 113-893-259-247-458; 132-246-550-138-466; 172-204-851-810-274; 196-009-736-643-674,20,"research support, non-u.s. gov't",(pmid) 27078370; (coreid) 42662934; (magid) 2196331788; (doi) 10.1103/physreve.93.032311,en

Once thought to be confined to developing countries, where it is associated with large epidemic outbreaks, this form of hepatitis is now recognised to be a disease with a widespread geographical distribution, sometimes related, in industrialised countries, to an asymptomatic zoonotic infection or parenteral transmission and, on rare occasions, presents as a chronic infection in immunocompromised patients. Anti-HEV positivity is more common than expected in areas in which the virus is not endemic (Western Europe and USA) but cases of clinical hepatitis E are rarely reported (1–5%)1; however, serological tests for HEV are not systematically performed in cases of acute hepatitis, even when infection with other hepatotropic viruses is ruled out. In the Mediterranean European countries (Italy, Spain and Greece) sporadic HEV infections have been reported, indicating that the virus is present in these populations; the estimated prevalence is approximately 3%2. A previous study of ours, concerning the prevalence of HEV infection in categories of population at risk living in the province of Foggia (Apulia, Southern Italy), showed a prevalence of 19.7% among immigrants and of 8.6% among haemodialysis patients. The purpose of this study was to determine whether hepatitis E is a frequent infection in the general population of this same province; for this purpose, we first used sera from blood donors.; ; Sera from 151 consecutive volunteer blood donors at the blood bank of Foggia Hospital were studied. All donors had previously completed the national medical questionnaire to verify that they fulfilled the criteria for blood donation and had given informed consent. The samples were investigated for the presence of anti-HEV immunoglobulins (IgG and IgM) using a commercial enzyme immunoassay (HEV IgG/IgM; DIA.PRO, Diagnostic BioProbes, Milan, Italy). Repeatedly positive results were confirmed with a western blot assay (HEV IgG/IgM Recomblot, Nuclear Laser Medicine, Milan, Italy).; ; The mean age of the enrolled donors was 37.3±4.7 years (range: 18–45 years). Over three-quarters (n=116, 76.9%) were men. The median alanine transferase value was 21 IU/L (normal value: 0–40 IU/L). Among the blood samples tested, only 2/151 (1.3%) were positive for anti-HEV/IgG, Western blotting confirmed the positive result of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; both the patients were negative for anti-HEV/IgM. Sixteen subjects (10.6%) were positive for anti-HAV/IgG, but there were no cases of co-infection. The 1.3% seroprevalence of anti-HEV/IgG observed in blood donors of our province is lower than that reported in other recent studies in industrialised countries (Brazil 2.3%3, France 3.2%4, Switzerland 4.9%5) and is consistent with data on the seroprevalence of HEV in the USA (1.2%)1. A higher rate of HEV infection was present in two different, distant countries: China (32.6%) and Denmark (20.6%). It is possible that poor sanitation could play a prominent role in the high rate of infection in urban and rural areas in the Asiatic country. In Denmark, since there is a high rate among farmers in this country, the main hypothesis is that HEV infection, among blood donors, is a zoonotic infection transmitted from domestic animals. We do not have data on work activities of all our donors, but neither of the anti-HEV positive subjects had occupations related to animals.; ; Although hepatitis A virus and HEV are both transmitted by the faecal-oral route, no association was found between these two infections in this study. This finding could reflect different patterns of transmission in these patients. Neither of the two positive donors had a recent history of travel in HEV endemic countries, but travel in regions of endemicity a long time ago and possible exposure to HEV cannot be excluded.; ; In conclusion, our data indicate a low prevalence of HEV infection among blood donors and, therefore, a low risk of transmission by blood. Nevertheless, the findings, together with those of another study in which we found HEV positivity in 3.1% of the general population, demonstrate that HEV is circulating in the province of Foggia. This epidemiological information may have implications for public health in general and blood product screening in particular. These issues deserve further study.",10,4,565,566,Outbreak; Internal medicine; Virology; Hepatitis; Seroprevalence; Hepatitis E virus; Hepatitis E; Population; Parenteral transmission; Serology; Medicine,,Adolescent; Adult; Blood Donors; Female; Hepatitis Antibodies/blood; Hepatitis E/blood; Hepatitis E virus; Humans; Immunoglobulin G/blood; Immunoglobulin M/blood; Italy/epidemiology; Male; Middle Aged; Seroepidemiologic Studies,Hepatitis Antibodies; Immunoglobulin G; Immunoglobulin M,,https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3496235 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3496235/,http://dx.doi.org/10.2450/2012.0154-11,10.2450/2012.0154-11,141306115,PMC3496235,0,011-741-845-550-408; 011-814-249-473-99X; 037-283-265-487-084; 054-253-593-030-234; 103-578-802-494-619,9,,(pmid) 22682344; (doi) 10.2450/2012.0154-11; (pii) 2012.0154-11; (magid) 141306115; (pmcid) pmc3496235,en

Meteorological sensors carried by UAVs can be employed to collect atmospheric information, providing better precision for the meteorological models at a local level. When these data are integrated in hydraulic/hydrological models, scene-generation becomes possible, thus allowing us to predict which regions are vulnerable to floods or landslides depending on different levels of rainfall.

It is recently tried to overcome the limits by facilitating user experience and VGI(Volunteered Geographic Information) in several geospatial web services. This study suggests 10C framework of geospatial web service for VGI through review and examination of previous research. Based on the 10C framework, the value chain system of 23 use cases relevant to the geospatial web service involving the creation of user’s VGI is investigated. The result of the value chain analysis is applied to examine and formulate the strategies to generate value addition from public spatial information with respect to creation, aggregation, delivery, and consumption process of VGI.Keywords : VGI(Volunteered Geographic Information), Geospatial Web Service for VGI, 10C Framework, Value Chain Analysis † ****** This work was supported by a grant from a strategic research project (Development of Geospatial Social Service Platform) funded by the Korea Agency for Infrastructure Technology Advancement.Won-Wook Choi, Research Fellow, Smart Urban Space Institute. wwchoi79@gmail.com (Primary Author)Sang-Ki Hong, Professor, Dept. of Urban Information Engineering, Anyang University. skhong@anyang.ac.kr Jong-Wook Ahn, Professor, Dept. of Urban Information Engineering.

The Italian Twin Register is a random population of twins at both the national level and within targeted geographical areas or birth cohorts. Further, the Register is linked with disease records and has recently implemented a web-based method for volunteer twin recruitment specifically designed to promote the Register and to disseminate information on genetic epidemiology. To date, approximately 9000 twins have joined the Italian Twin Register, the majority of whom (approximately 70%) represent young adults aged 20 at time of enrollment. Although the total number of twins recruited to date is far below the expected figure initially predicted, the newly established standardized procedures guarantee an increase of around 2000 twins each year. Following the collaboration between the Italian Twin Register and the main Italian nonprofit association for blood donors, twin DNA sampling and storage has recently accelerated contributing to the large amount of phenotypic data collected. The Italian Twin Register is currently involved in both population and clinical based studies on various complex phenotypes and diseases, some conducted within large European consortia.",9,6,799,805,Epidemiology; Demography; Project commissioning; Genetic epidemiology; Population; National level; Birth cohort; Random population; Medicine; Correlation and dependence,,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Child; Cohort Studies; Confidentiality; Data Collection; Databases, Factual; Female; Humans; Italy; Male; Middle Aged; Registries/ethics; Twin Studies as Topic/ethics; Twins, Dizygotic; Twins, Monozygotic",,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rodolfo_Cotichini/publication/6550299_The_Italian_Twin_Register_new_cohorts_and_tools_current_projects_and_future_perspectives_of_a_developing_resource/links/00b4952d53c868d9ae000000.pdf http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S1832427400007106 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17254411,http://dx.doi.org/10.1375/twin.9.6.799,10.1375/twin.9.6.799; 10.1375/183242706779462624,2067912381,,0,003-671-155-871-377; 005-864-551-445-285; 009-661-474-794-427; 020-909-629-275-213; 043-517-053-250-92X; 060-935-075-843-521; 082-356-940-562-284; 092-959-293-501-981; 101-796-746-978-274; 102-567-999-517-334; 109-549-150-041-31X; 116-035-071-418-145; 147-773-880-022-959; 155-902-760-527-758; 165-895-348-848-023,26,"research support, non-u.s. gov't",(magid) 2067912381; (pmid) 17254411; (pii) s1832427400007106; (doi) 10.1375/twin.9.6.799; (doi) 10.1375/183242706779462624,en

In this article, we transfer this research question in the field of lexical encoding of geographic information onto the level of intertextuality. To this end, we explore <jats:italic>Volunteered Geographic Information</jats:italic> (VGI) to model texts addressing places at the level of cities or regions with the help of so-called topic networks. This is done to examine how language encodes and networks geographic information on the aboutness level of texts. Our hypothesis is that the networked thematizations of places are similar, regardless of their distances and the underlying communities of authors. To investigate this, we introduce <jats:italic>Multiplex Topic Network</jats:italic>s (MTN), which we automatically derive from <jats:italic>Linguistic Multilayer Network</jats:italic>s (LMN) as a novel model, especially of thematic networking in text corpora. Our study shows a Zipfian organization of the thematic universe in which geographical places (especially cities) are located in online communication. We interpret this finding in the context of <jats:italic>cognitive maps</jats:italic>, a notion which we extend by so-called <jats:italic>thematic maps</jats:italic>. According to our interpretation of this finding, the organization of thematic maps as part of cognitive maps results from a tendency of authors to generate shareable content that ensures the continued existence of the underlying media. We test our hypothesis by example of special wikis and extracts of Wikipedia. In this way, we come to the conclusion that geographical places, whether close to each other or not, are located in neighboring semantic places that span similar subnetworks in the topic universe.</jats:p>",2020,,1,47,Cognitive map; Text corpus; Data science; Research question; Aboutness; Intertextuality; Computer science; Volunteered geographic information; Thematic map,,,,Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/complexity/2020/4607025/ https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr2002.html#abs-2002-01454 https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:hin:complx:4607025 https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/complexity/2020/4607025.pdf https://philpapers.org/rec/MEHFTN https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.01454,http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2020/4607025,10.1155/2020/4607025,3020683605,,0,000-203-627-584-442; 000-245-181-397-161; 000-841-397-940-136; 003-973-281-954-118; 004-570-658-184-476; 004-682-225-354-448; 004-785-586-548-143; 005-032-109-428-026; 005-362-794-011-414; 005-540-929-147-925; 006-101-714-460-131; 008-174-400-647-761; 009-989-892-709-255; 011-307-720-531-674; 012-367-777-689-406; 015-586-822-938-491; 015-640-931-441-294; 017-194-800-561-718; 020-218-323-118-458; 023-514-753-403-561; 023-577-714-976-285; 024-908-127-778-807; 025-138-712-861-431; 025-508-549-144-066; 026-023-072-124-009; 027-048-457-606-399; 028-809-587-107-037; 029-684-988-187-963; 033-508-405-845-891; 035-346-837-934-955; 036-040-869-680-843; 036-330-282-509-137; 036-761-925-759-944; 041-658-614-339-032; 042-450-449-593-080; 043-079-273-711-014; 046-889-172-437-996; 050-822-308-110-465; 053-113-638-104-567; 057-545-918-303-995; 063-118-362-653-80X; 063-913-953-112-362; 070-513-141-435-781; 071-939-600-808-335; 072-084-854-993-126; 072-281-694-818-398; 074-742-877-053-350; 074-792-812-248-435; 077-302-191-078-385; 088-088-654-954-471; 089-318-185-123-321; 090-025-965-372-894; 090-469-976-149-644; 095-441-629-844-738; 097-612-174-011-049; 100-302-280-724-192; 102-444-010-468-754; 103-283-354-829-009; 104-833-265-022-668; 110-194-985-473-730; 118-713-134-426-98X; 120-054-338-932-61X; 121-001-950-491-969; 121-199-131-298-635; 130-959-252-901-109; 141-463-952-104-338; 145-264-449-053-653; 152-201-106-726-663; 170-930-168-586-654; 172-480-230-468-85X; 178-752-318-573-093; 180-908-800-746-247; 193-518-676-396-03X; 196-499-572-080-610,6,,(doi) 10.1155/2020/4607025; (magid) 3020683605,en

A dive company in Phuket, Thailand, documented whale shark sightings in the Andaman Sea for 10 years along 300 km of coastline. Whale shark sightings, corrected for effort, dropped by 96% between 1998 and 2001. Combining the seasons from 1992 to 1998, the number of whale shark sightings increased significantly from October to May. The sizes of sharks observed suggest that the majority were juveniles.

This phenomenon is known as volunteered geographic information (VGI). During the past decade VGI has been used as a data source supporting a wide range of services, such as environmental monitoring, events reporting, human movement analysis, disaster management, etc. However, these volunteer-contributed data also come with varying quality. Reasons for this are: data is produced by heterogeneous contributors, using various technologies and tools, having different level of details and precision, serving heterogeneous purposes, and a lack of gatekeepers. Crowd-sourcing, social, and geographic approaches have been proposed and later followed to develop appropriate methods to assess the quality measures and indicators of VGI. In this article, we review various quality measures and indicators for selected types of VGI and existing quality assessment methods. As an outcome, the article presents a classification of VGI with current methods utilized to assess the quality of selected types of VGI. Through these findings, we introduce data mining as an additional approach for quality handling in VGI",31,1,139,167,Spatial analysis; Geography; Data science; Data source; Hand held devices; Movement analysis; Quality assessment; Environmental monitoring; Volunteered geographic information; Emergency management,,,,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft,https://doi.org/10.1080/13658816.2016.1189556 https://core.ac.uk/display/80159881 https://usiena-air.unisi.it/handle/11365/999045 https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13658816.2016.1189556 https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1504729/ https://kops.uni-konstanz.de/bitstream/123456789/34241/3/Senaratne_0-341149.pdf https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/gis/gis31.html#SenaratneMACH17 https://kops.uni-konstanz.de/handle/123456789/34241 https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13658816.2016.1189556,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13658816.2016.1189556,10.1080/13658816.2016.1189556,2412667021,,0,001-411-219-307-043; 001-453-166-921-212; 001-922-053-194-193; 004-445-599-749-605; 006-057-019-890-636; 007-672-181-897-634; 007-684-128-166-136; 010-390-048-140-045; 010-469-991-531-778; 011-567-887-224-394; 013-445-037-365-411; 014-341-806-501-343; 015-264-538-059-64X; 015-380-000-547-543; 016-228-507-176-809; 018-944-179-546-339; 019-226-991-602-231; 021-516-035-736-472; 022-473-450-579-960; 023-290-850-444-285; 023-627-632-136-71X; 023-687-402-829-072; 024-507-221-009-740; 024-744-797-489-010; 024-875-534-874-574; 026-645-756-189-301; 027-666-068-785-379; 029-018-635-018-764; 029-263-057-554-467; 030-416-570-557-01X; 030-975-962-975-895; 031-450-942-446-667; 032-353-715-439-039; 034-700-292-894-465; 036-045-596-267-027; 036-670-900-801-09X; 037-756-060-076-860; 038-976-596-179-447; 040-184-564-272-635; 040-267-517-107-219; 041-981-425-702-98X; 044-184-752-571-531; 047-978-080-963-738; 048-400-414-195-536; 049-648-174-134-552; 053-701-934-194-211; 053-914-393-088-262; 057-042-196-938-512; 057-545-918-303-995; 059-112-511-613-974; 062-988-018-429-430; 065-031-728-023-345; 067-241-321-927-623; 067-617-607-831-363; 068-201-095-586-313; 068-474-082-685-80X; 070-115-476-164-553; 070-772-418-669-772; 072-346-674-622-560; 077-776-126-525-825; 078-460-486-926-118; 084-271-557-767-164; 088-339-711-439-200; 090-766-037-404-513; 096-214-706-866-452; 097-338-432-344-323; 097-612-174-011-049; 097-773-332-306-457; 098-338-742-807-406; 098-786-398-368-932; 100-393-554-235-14X; 102-855-110-821-056; 111-163-933-663-414; 111-901-923-536-480; 122-275-914-510-581; 123-071-990-086-470; 127-491-841-235-58X; 133-737-600-240-948; 138-013-940-035-252; 138-847-225-776-212; 142-189-587-859-27X; 143-352-523-458-745; 145-350-454-429-564; 147-213-981-170-541; 159-492-867-376-538; 163-216-510-935-433; 171-544-875-588-246; 185-220-165-667-73X; 188-259-013-084-890; 192-910-201-156-470; 195-088-365-858-271; 197-056-794-367-303; 198-527-202-666-479; 199-342-702-513-271,213,,(coreid) 80159881; (magid) 2412667021; (doi) 10.1080/13658816.2016.1189556,it; en

Wiersma,"The amateur birding community has a long and proud tradition of contributing to bird surveys and bird atlases. Coordinated activities such as Breeding Bird Atlases and the Christmas Bird Count are examples of ""citizen science"" projects. With the advent of technology, Web 2.0 sites such as eBird have been developed to facilitate online sharing of data and thus increase the potential for real-time monitoring. However, as recently articulated in an editorial in this journal and elsewhere, monitoring is best served when based on a priori hypotheses. Harnessing citizen scientists to collect data following a hypotheticodeductive approach carries challenges. Moreover, the use of citizen science in scientific and monitoring studies has raised issues of data accuracy and quality. These issues are compounded when data collection moves into the Web 2.0 world. An examination of the literature from social geography on the concept of ""citizen sensors"" and volunteered geographic information (VGI) yields thoughtful reflections on the challenges of data quality/data accuracy when applying information from citizen sensors to research and management questions. VGI has been harnessed in a number of contexts, including for environmental and ecological monitoring activities. Here, I argue that conceptualizing a monitoring project as an experiment following the scientific method can further contribute to the use of VGI. I show how principles of experimental design can be applied to monitoring projects to better control for data quality of VGI. This includes suggestions for how citizen sensors can be harnessed to address issues of experimental controls and how to design monitoring projects to increase randomization and replication of sampled data, hence increasing scientific reliability and statistical power. RESUME. La communaute des ornithologues amateurs a une longue et fiere tradition de contribution aux denombrements d’oiseaux et aux projets d’atlas. Les activites telles que les atlas d’oiseaux nicheurs et le Recensement des oiseaux de Noel sont des exemples de ""science citoyenne"". Avec l’avenement de la technologie informatique, des sites internet 2.0 comme celui d’eBird ont ete developpes afin de permettre l’entree en ligne des donnees, ouvrant ainsi la possibilite d’assurer un suivi en temps reel. Cependant, tel que mentionne dans un editorial recemment publie dans cette revue et dans d’autres publications, le suivi est plus efficace lorsqu’il repose sur des hypotheses a priori. Mettre la science citoyenne a contribution pour recolter des donnees en suivant une approche hypothetico-deductive comporte des defis. De plus, le recours aux citoyens dans le cadre d’etudes scientifiques et de programmes de suivi souleve la question de la precision et de la qualite des donnees. Cette question est d’autant plus serieuse lorsque les donnees sont recoltees dans le contexte de l’internet 2.0. Une revue de la litterature en geographie sociale sur les concepts de ""citoyens capteurs"" et d’information geographique volontaire (IGV) fournit des reflexions utiles sur les defis de qualite et de precision des donnees lorsqu’on applique l’information fournie par les citoyens capteurs dans les domaines de la recherche et de la gestion. L’IGV a ete mise a profit dans un grand nombre de contextes, incluant les programmes de suivi ecologique et environnemental. Dans cet essai, je soutiens Department of Biology, Memorial University Avian Conservation and Ecology 5(2): 13 http://www.ace-eco.org/vol5/iss2/art13/ que la conceptualisation d’un projet de suivi en tant qu’experience scientifique peut contribuer davantage a l’utilisation des IGV. J’illustre de quelle facon les dispositifs experimentaux peuvent etre appliques aux projets de suivi afin de mieux controler la qualite des donnees issues d’IGV. Ceci inclut des suggestions sur l’implication des citoyens capteurs afin de mettre en place des temoins experimentaux et de developper des programmes de suivi afin d’accroitre la randomisation et la replication des donnees echantillonnees, ce qui augmente la fiabilite scientifique et la puissance statistique.",5,2,,,World Wide Web; Social geography; Citizen science; Reel; Ligne; Data accuracy; Ecological monitoring; Volunteered geographic information,,,,,http://www.ace-eco.org/vol5/iss2/art13/ http://www.ace-eco.org/vol5/iss2/art13/ACE-ECO-2010-427.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.5751/ace-00427-050213,10.5751/ace-00427-050213,2315156699,,0,,55,,(magid) 2315156699; (doi) 10.5751/ace-00427-050213; (coreid) 28352863,en

Bach; Andrew M. Defever; William J. Chopik; Sara Konrath,"Empathy is often studied at the individual level, but little is known about variation in empathy across geographic regions and how this variation is associated with important regional-level outcomes. The present study examined associations between state-level empathy, prosocial behavior, and antisocial behavior in the United States. Participants were 79,563 U.S. residential adults who completed measures of cognitive and emotional empathy (i.e., perspective taking and empathic concern). Information on prosocial and antisocial behavior was retrieved from publicly available government databases. All indices of empathy were related to lower rates of violent crime, aggravated assault, and robbery. Total empathy was associated with higher well-being and higher volunteer rates. Implications for geographic variation in empathy, prosocial behavior, and antisocial behavior are discussed",68,,124,130,Developmental psychology; Government; Psychology; Prosocial behavior; Cognition; Empathic concern; Empathy; Perspective-taking; Geographic variation; Personal distress; Social psychology,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092656616301088 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092656616301088,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jrp.2016.12.007,10.1016/j.jrp.2016.12.007,2567071421,,0,004-790-733-990-895; 006-264-137-304-476; 007-400-405-894-012; 008-187-153-634-148; 010-271-005-372-282; 013-545-042-436-657; 024-567-458-994-640; 029-236-778-491-239; 036-838-947-041-389; 040-630-843-123-971; 043-080-192-584-453; 046-351-654-557-136; 053-914-315-474-408; 055-368-616-108-96X; 059-120-243-178-266; 059-876-872-932-858; 069-813-512-668-04X; 071-895-714-926-450; 093-953-082-851-737; 099-391-609-617-768; 103-627-156-125-445; 107-064-204-070-936; 118-982-843-083-25X; 122-839-733-633-209; 150-697-996-679-430; 153-975-437-863-924; 157-191-140-607-807; 165-525-864-465-063,14,,(magid) 2567071421; (coreid) 81634156; (doi) 10.1016/j.jrp.2016.12.007,en
020-603-812-145-749,Conceptual framework for enhancing visual change point analysis in generalized multi-temporal displays,2019-07-10,2019,journal article,Proceedings of the ICA,25702092,Copernicus GmbH,,Jochen Schiewe,"<jats:p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract.&lt;/strong&gt; Large amounts of point data are being generated and depicted in web maps, in particular promoted by the availability of Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI). This data volume causes usability problems for the visual presentation and exploration, especially by decreasing rendering performance and increasing geometric or semantic point clutter. Typically, generalization techniques are applied in order to overcome these clutter problems. Appropriate constraint-based approaches have been developed for static and single displays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to the increasing amount and relevance of multi-temporal point data, the aim of this contribution is to present a so far missing conceptual framework that consists of constraints related to change point analysis. These constraints describe the effects of the generalization on preservation and legibility of change information. Here, different types of change point analysis are differentiated, namely: existential changes, changes of semantic properties, and changes of spatial properties. For this purpose, difference frames between two given frames of the multi-temporal data set are used as a model of the mental representation of change information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resulting constraints can be used to describe and to compare the suitability of various generalization operations for specific tasks. However, in a later stage they can also trigger the generalization processes as such. This could lead to a new way of thinking, since the optimization of generalization processes should work on difference frames rather than on single views.&lt;/p&gt;;                     </jats:p>",2,,1,7,Clutter; Conceptual framework; Usability; Semantic property; Rendering (computer graphics); Information retrieval; Legibility; Computer science; Volunteered geographic information; Mental representation,,,,,https://noa.gwlb.de/receive/cop_mods_00001403 https://www.proc-int-cartogr-assoc.net/2/114/2019/ica-proc-2-114-2019.pdf https://www.proc-int-cartogr-assoc.net/2/114/2019/,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/ica-proc-2-114-2019,10.5194/ica-proc-2-114-2019,2959182490,,0,,1,,(doi) 10.5194/ica-proc-2-114-2019; (magid) 2959182490,en

However, the distinction between VGI as an information product and the processes that create VGI is blurred. Clearly, the environment that influences the creation of VGI is different than the information product itself, yet most literature treats them as one and the same. Thus, this research is motivated by the need to formalize and standardize the systems that support the creation of VGI. To this end, we propose a conceptual framework for VGI systems, the main components of which—project, participants, and technical infrastructure—form an environment conducive to the creation of VGI. Drawing on examples from OpenStreetMap, Ushahidi, and RinkWatch, we illustrate the pragmatic relevance of these components. Applying a system perspective to VGI allows us to better understand the components and functionality needed to effectively create VGI",3,4,1278,1292,Systems science; Conceptual framework; Geography; Data science; Geoweb; Information product; Public participation GIS; Knowledge management; Volunteered geographic information; Crowdsourcing,,,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/3/4/1278/pdf http://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/3/4/1278/pdf https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ijgi/ijgi3.html#FastR14 https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi3041278 https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/3/4/1278 https://core.ac.uk/display/90733723,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi3041278,10.3390/ijgi3041278,1991837421,,0,006-819-919-095-61X; 008-655-662-451-459; 014-425-368-123-634; 021-820-245-681-621; 024-236-571-440-440; 024-908-127-778-807; 029-573-598-942-562; 033-466-158-951-706; 034-296-402-405-270; 035-042-683-916-582; 035-161-913-145-763; 037-142-616-300-789; 038-976-596-179-447; 040-267-517-107-219; 043-308-837-852-645; 047-100-212-874-054; 051-254-947-000-266; 051-672-609-357-192; 053-509-800-790-907; 057-357-333-577-597; 057-545-918-303-995; 067-098-369-726-645; 078-191-959-374-104; 079-150-284-796-055; 079-413-893-273-040; 082-366-214-673-579; 090-717-863-035-819; 091-204-512-390-272; 097-579-374-197-990; 097-612-174-011-049; 100-635-968-014-055; 100-866-038-545-202; 102-160-469-693-977; 102-515-255-327-189; 106-264-944-278-433; 118-664-439-532-507; 130-700-123-619-585; 133-710-610-907-566; 136-541-825-039-393; 145-138-812-060-843; 146-857-588-283-096; 147-539-342-970-008; 147-826-896-424-422; 148-615-143-308-423; 158-263-557-750-410; 162-552-009-012-930; 164-241-021-060-446; 169-004-007-623-620; 171-544-875-588-246; 171-960-446-138-40X; 186-945-691-127-703; 195-019-623-135-107; 198-122-408-150-421,30,,(doi) 10.3390/ijgi3041278; (coreid) 90733723; (magid) 1991837421,en

Georgiadou; Ourania Kounadi; R.A. de By,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>;             <jats:p>Digital Earth scholars have recently argued for a code of ethics to protect individuals’ location privacy and human dignity. In this chapter, we contribute to the debate in two ways. First, we focus on (geo)privacy because information about an individual’s location is substantially different from other personal information. The compound word (geo)privacy suggests that location can be inferred from people’s interests, activities, and sociodemographics, not only from traditional geographic coordinates. (Geo)privacy is a claim of individuals to determine for themselves when, how, and to what extent location information about them is communicated to others. Second, we take an interdisciplinary perspective. We draw from (geo)computing to describe the transformation of volunteered, observed, and inferred information and suggest privacy-preserving measures. We also draw from organization studies to dissect privacy into ideal types of social relationships and privacy-preserving strategies. We take the point of view of Alice, an individual ‘data subject’ encountered in data protection legislation, and suggest ways to account for privacy as a sociocultural phenomenon in the future. Although most of the discussion refers to the EU and the US, we provide a brief overview of data protection legislation on the African continent and in China as well as various global and regional ethics guidelines that are of very recent vintage.</jats:p>",,,785,810,Internet privacy; Digital Earth; Sociology; Personally identifiable information; Sociocultural evolution; Compound; Legislation; Dignity; Phenomenon; Data Protection Act 1998,,,,,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-32-9915-3_25 https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Aris.utwente.nl%3Apublications%2F052f839f-208a-45ac-a9bb-72f2a5706023 https://utwente-staging.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/digital-earth-ethics https://research.utwente.nl/en/publications/digital-earth-ethics,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-32-9915-3_25,10.1007/978-981-32-9915-3_25,2985601821,,0,000-307-393-216-271; 000-386-088-786-17X; 004-810-858-088-737; 006-286-598-785-601; 006-397-061-150-915; 006-902-603-626-928; 010-937-381-186-801; 013-953-032-912-923; 018-762-158-788-219; 020-126-273-086-102; 024-098-387-860-856; 027-984-284-102-740; 028-352-787-370-465; 028-707-326-304-991; 030-086-137-205-866; 030-806-055-072-29X; 036-444-615-331-388; 038-219-146-952-756; 038-751-337-864-493; 039-871-818-933-659; 044-612-045-393-164; 045-783-110-414-615; 046-597-786-880-082; 050-487-419-966-877; 051-116-924-737-323; 067-990-323-054-81X; 072-541-211-429-688; 076-150-370-151-73X; 076-700-972-398-936; 089-433-387-461-963; 092-119-115-946-628; 092-247-213-128-836; 094-821-842-349-507; 118-777-750-815-244; 143-351-242-157-386; 153-500-067-617-953; 163-556-661-292-94X; 164-040-358-075-343; 192-386-208-066-218,1,,(magid) 2985601821; (doi) 10.1007/978-981-32-9915-3_25,en

This will be based on people’s personal characteristics and environmental factors known to affect landscape perception. A prototype user-interface has been designed for eliciting users’ perceptions of landscape elements and colors they perceive from photographs of landscape views. In the long-term, a VGI repository database will be maintained to make personalized location specific recommendations about suitable landscape views for user-specified locations. A prototype fuzzy logic recommendation system comprising 72 rules has also been designed to model how personal factors (gender, age, health status) and perceived colors likely determine the aesthetic suitability of landscape views. An initial trial revealed some limitations and stressed the need for further testing of the feasibility of fuzzy logic as the reasoning framework for this LBS for recommending suitable landscape views. 1. Introduction As urbanity imposes psychological demands that become excessive, people seek stress- reducing (especially natural) environments where they can recreate and relax. The investigation of the ecological and visual aspects of physical landscapes is critical for understanding and addressing many of the psychosomatic disorders of urban dwellers. In this paper, we focus on visual perception of people’s everyday environments. Human-beings engage in a wide variety of important decisions in their everyday lives, based on visual properties of the geographic environment and their geographical knowledge. Examples include coping with environmental visual pollution, finding one’s way in spatially extended areas, and finding a landscape view appropriate to one’s emotional status. Color, shape, composition, and configuration of objects are important components of visual stimuli that should be studied to understand our perceptions of and reactions to physical landscapes in urban environments. In this short paper, we present the rationale and initial design considerations for a prototype Location Based Service (LBS) for landscape view assessment. This LBS will ultimately offer people personalized recommendations for places (near their chosen location(s)) that are most likely to appeal to them aesthetically. The LBS is designed to make such personalized recommendations based on available knowledge of how people’s personal characteristics affects landscape perception. A prototype user-interface has been designed for eliciting users’ perceptions about the types of landscape elements and the colors they perceive in images showing landscape views. An important goal of this project is to maintain a large database of people’s perception of landscape views, based on volunteered geographic information (VGI) generated from people tagging images uploaded by them and/or others.",1,1,,,Geomatics; Location-based service; Visual perception; Geography; Data science; Perception; Visual pollution; Urbanity; Recommender system; Knowledge management; Volunteered geographic information,,,,,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/2js988p1,http://dx.doi.org/10.21433/b3112js988p1,10.21433/b3112js988p1,2620533440,,0,,1,,(magid) 2620533440; (doi) 10.21433/b3112js988p1,en

Worldwide, several hundred thousand people are currently contributing information to the “free” geodatabase. However, the data contributions show a geographically heterogeneous pattern around the globe. Germany counts as one of the most active countries in OSM; thus, the German street network has undergone an extensive development in recent years. The question that remains is this: How does the street network perform in a relative comparison with a commercial dataset? By means of a variety of studies, we show that the difference between the OSM street network for car navigation in Germany and a comparable proprietary dataset was only 9% in June 2011. The results of our analysis regarding the entire street network showed that OSM even exceeds the information provided by the proprietary dataset by 27%. Further analyses show on what scale errors can be reckoned with in the topology of the street network, and the completeness of turn restrictions and street name information. In addition to the analyses conducted over the past few years, projections have additionally been made about the point in time by which the OSM dataset for Germany can be considered “complete” in relative comparison to a commercial dataset",4,1,1,21,Data mining; German; Spatial database; Globe; Street network; Quality assessment; Computer science; Volunteered geographic information; Cartography,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/25867088 http://www.mdpi.com/1999-5903/4/1/1/pdf https://doi.org/10.3390/fi4010001 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/fi/fi4.html#NeisZZ12 https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fi4010001 https://www.mdpi.com/1999-5903/4/1/1 https://www.mdpi.com/1999-5903/4/1/1/pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fi4010001,10.3390/fi4010001,2075598345,,0,016-587-113-753-364; 017-194-800-561-718; 020-749-054-636-988; 021-074-586-154-668; 022-866-126-935-748; 024-045-992-130-617; 030-217-575-405-566; 031-693-310-151-111; 032-903-495-847-439; 038-150-272-862-695; 038-976-596-179-447; 039-008-601-346-536; 040-267-517-107-219; 047-100-212-874-054; 057-545-918-303-995; 062-988-018-429-430; 066-336-138-162-728; 085-221-214-334-157; 088-339-711-439-200; 100-866-038-545-202; 103-231-819-030-471; 106-919-166-865-846; 118-490-814-259-358; 124-043-027-110-303; 136-570-589-999-562; 149-278-345-008-041; 170-767-348-108-054; 171-544-875-588-246; 195-019-623-135-107,257,,(magid) 2075598345; (coreid) 27383535; (doi) 10.3390/fi4010001,en
022-549-525-890-277,Will the new rules for research ethics committees lead to better decisions,2004-03-31,2004,journal article,Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine,01410768; 17581095,SAGE Publications Ltd,United Kingdom,Neville W. Goodman,"Researchers can view research ethics committees as an intolerable burden on their pushing back of the medical frontiers. The truth is both more serious and more prosaic. There are enough examples of poor research ethics easily to justify the need for ethical overview of research; and most research is trivial.; ; The past few years have seen two upheavals in the organization of research ethics committees. They were driven partly by the pharmaceutical industry, and the industry had a point. Projects had to be reviewed by every research ethics committee in whose geographic patch individuals might be approached to take part, each committee having its own timetable and its own requirements, which might be incompatible with those of others. The differentiation between local research ethics committees (LRECs) and regionally based multicentre committees (MRECs) was an excellent idea, which worked. At first, some LRECs were uneasy at having to accept another committee's ethical review, but most were simply grateful at having less to do.; ; Another stimulus to change came from certain widely publicized studies in which the research ethics came under question. The blame did not lie with RECs, but regulation of ethics review was a necessary part of the research governance set up to prevent similar episodes in the future. More recently, European Union directives have demanded further changes and medical research ethics is awash with the acronyms of accountability, transparency and regulation—GAfREC, COREC, OREC. We now have SOPs—standard operating procedures.; ; At first, the SOPs seem unnecessarily fussy, with numbered standard letters for every purpose, and stipulation about exactly how e-mails are formatted with their appropriate disclaimers. But in the age of the computer, standard letters are a sensible approach, and in ethical matters there is no harm in being seen to treat every researcher in the same way, without favour. Many of the stipulations in the new regulations, which have the force of law from 1 May 2004, are indeed welcome. Committees used to differ greatly in their time to approve or reject applications; now there is a strict 60-day limit (though the clock stops while investigators' replies are awaited). Committees have to meet monthly; the number of applications they can consider per meeting is defined; there are rules for how subcommittees deal with issues that need not come back to full committee. The overall remit of RECs is made clear. The need for proper support, financial and educational, is recognized and there are budgets. But it is difficult to avoid the impression that the emphasis is on process, not on ethics. Whenever chairs of research ethics committees get together, this is the undercurrent to all conversation. Process, and changes in process, and implications of changes in process dominate training events. Until now, RECs have simply existed; from 1 May they will have to be accredited. The draft accreditation document is concerned almost entirely with process. Does uniform process ensure good ethical decisions?; ; One of the standards for accreditation is that committees (which have a maximum membership of 18) ‘must have’ balanced membership as regards age and sex, ethnic minorities, and disabilities. There are parallel standards to define who are appropriate expert and lay members. For some committees it was difficult enough finding people willing to sit even in the old days when committees pretty well ran their own affairs. Now they may have to go looking for a black female statistician. What is the correct balance of committee members with disabilities? What, anyway, is a disability? Committees can, of course, do their best to recruit a diverse range of members, and it would be wrong to reject an applicant because they are ‘too old’ or partially sighted. But ‘must’ is must.; ; Within the regulations, committees at least have full control over their own actions. They have only limited control over the researchers who send them applications. With more pandering to the political-correctness lobby, RECs are asked to ‘take into consideration the principle of justice [which] requires that the benefits and burdens of research be distributed fairly among all groups and classes in society, taking into account in particular age, gender, economic status, culture and ethnic considerations’. While investigators should be challenged on artificial age limits and should take care not to exclude certain groups by imposing conditions that might offend them, there are too many possibilities here for committees to be unnecessarily obstructive by, for example, demanding interpreters and translated information sheets for all projects. Some projects will necessarily exclude or include certain groups. Committees can consider projects only in isolation; they cannot take actions to ensure that research projects as a whole are distributed fairly. In the end, investigators investigate what they want to investigate, because that is what interests them.; ; The clearest evidence that process is more important than ethics is the stipulation that ethics committees can have only ‘one bite at the cherry’. Committees can ask investigators for as much clarification and ask for as many modifications as they want, but they can do this only once. They cannot later raise any further ethical issues. It is easy to see what underlies this. Committees could delay projects for months by raising issues one at a time—such as yet more modifications of the patient information sheet—which is clearly unsatisfactory and probably, in itself, unethical. But there is not even an ‘under exceptional circumstances’ rider. What if a committee member realizes at a late stage that there is an ethical issue so far overlooked? What is the committee to do, if to reject the research is then illegal? There is no official advice about this. One bite at the cherry is all we are allowed.; ; And what are the issues that exercise research ethics committees? Yes, every now and then a really thorny issue surfaces, but most of the effort goes into trivial projects that will do no harm but are unlikely to do any good. And information sheets. Much of the actual time that committee members spend on project applications goes to reading, correcting and rewriting the patient information sheets. Great store is set, quite rightly, on informed consent. It pervades all other ethical issues in research. If investigators cannot make clear to us what they are doing, how will they explain it to participants? There is no rule saying that ethics committees should rewrite information sheets; they do it because they have to.; ; It is uncomfortably true that, however much research ethics committees do to help investigators perform studies ethically, the only way we will know if investigators are behaving ethically is to watch them. Voluntary ethics committees simply cannot do that, and I suspect they do not wish to. Volunteers flourish free. Now that strict regulation is deemed necessary, it is only a matter of time before research ethics committees become just another part of the professional accountability business. Whether research participants will be any better protected remains to be seen.; ; Note I am chair of Southmead Local Research Ethics Committee.",97,4,198,199,Research ethics; Law; Accountability; Suspect; Exceptional circumstances; Stipulation; European union; Informed consent; Medicine; Information ethics,,"Decision Making; Ethics Committees, Research/organization & administration; United Kingdom",,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15056748 http://core.ac.uk/display/3636643 https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/014107680409700415 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC1079364,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/014107680409700415,10.1177/014107680409700415; 10.1258/jrsm.97.4.198,2033287572,PMC1079364,0,,2,,(magid) 2033287572; (pmid) 15056748; (pmcid) pmc1079364; (doi) 10.1177/014107680409700415; (doi) 10.1258/jrsm.97.4.198,en

Ostermann; Laura Spinsanti; Gianluca Luraschi; Simon Cox; Manoli Nuñez; Bertrand De Longueville,"Thanks to recent convergence of greater access to broadband connections, the availability of Global Positioning Systems in small packages at affordable prices and more participative forms of interaction on the Web (Web 2.0), vast numbers of individuals became able to create and share Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI). The potential of up to six billion persons to monitor the state of the environment, validate global models with local knowledge, contribute to crisis situations awareness, and provide information that only humans can capture is vast and has yet to be fully exploited. Integrating VGI into Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDI) is a major challenge, as it is often regarded as insufficiently structured, documented, or validated according to scientific standards. Early instances of SDIs used to have limited ability to manage and process geosensor-based data (beyond remotely sensed imagery), which tend to arrive in continuous streams of real-time information. The current works on standards for Sensor Web Enablement fill this gap. This paper shows how such standards can be applied to VGI, thus converting it in a timely, cost-effective and valuable source of information for SDIs. By doing so, we extend previous efforts describing a workflow for VGI integration into SDI and further advance an initial set of VGI Sensing and event detection techniques. Examples of how such VGI Sensing techniques can support crisis information system are provided. The presented approach serves central building blocks for a Digital Earth’s nervous system, which is required to develop the next generation of (geospatial) information infrastructures.JRC.H.6-Digital Earth and Reference Dat",5,1,3,18,Digital Earth; World Wide Web; Spatial analysis; Workflow; Information system; Spatial data infrastructure; Geography; State of the Environment; Volunteered geographic information; Geospatial analysis,,,,,https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Aris.utwente.nl%3Apublications%2F28b76832-6be1-41bd-afec-dc20b5233e58 http://repositori.uji.es/xmlui/handle/10234/43682 https://utwente-staging.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/citizen-based-sensing-of-crisis-events-sensor-web-enablement-for- http://repositori.uji.es/xmlui/bitstream/10234/43682/1/49394.pdf http://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC59363 http://dial.uclouvain.be/pr/boreal/object/boreal:160796 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12518-011-0056-y https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/pub?pid=csiro:EP11008 https://core.ac.uk/display/61409532 https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12518-011-0056-y http://www.iapad.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/ID_02.pdf https://research.utwente.nl/en/publications/citizen-based-sensing-of-crisis-events-sensor-web-enablement-for-,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12518-011-0056-y,10.1007/s12518-011-0056-y,2045904660,,0,004-316-910-691-741; 005-374-785-075-748; 005-896-305-143-114; 006-612-965-080-699; 011-117-899-271-579; 012-036-876-395-351; 017-843-441-399-647; 026-072-640-174-348; 029-263-057-554-467; 030-956-330-410-016; 032-903-495-847-439; 040-267-517-107-219; 045-515-595-594-237; 049-648-174-134-552; 061-919-737-879-635; 066-860-347-324-309; 067-473-416-042-927; 085-281-531-685-553; 091-383-939-895-049; 103-859-285-040-344; 104-591-128-843-065; 117-079-199-118-919; 135-360-535-210-851; 143-957-295-030-748; 150-712-123-658-158; 158-847-532-778-731; 171-544-875-588-246; 185-701-246-919-65X; 188-678-650-340-531,62,,(magid) 2045904660; (coreid) 38629778; (doi) 10.1007/s12518-011-0056-y,en; es

Doucette,"As open source volunteered geographic information continues to gain popularity, the user community and data contributions are expected to grow, e.g., CloudMade, Apple, and Ushahidi now provide OpenStreetMap© (OSM) as a base layer for some of their mapping applications. This, coupled with the lack of cartographic standards and the expectation to one day be able to use this vector data for more geopositionally sensitive applications, like GPS navigation, leaves potential users and researchers to question the accuracy of the database. This research takes a photogrammetric approach to determining the positional accuracy of OSM road features using stereo imagery and a vector adjustment model. The method applies rigorous analytical measurement principles to compute accurate real world geolocations of OSM road vectors. The proposed approach was tested on several urban gridded city streets from the OSM database with the results showing that the post adjusted shape points improved positionally by 86%. Furthermore, the vector adjustment was able to recover 95% of the actual positional displacement present in the database. To demonstrate a practical application, a head-to-head positional accuracy assessment between OSM, the USGS National Map (TNM), and United States Census Bureau’s Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding Referencing (TIGER) 2007 roads was conducted",2,2,276,301,Photogrammetry; Data mining; Encoding (memory); Geography; Gps navigation; Stereo imagery; Open source; The National Map; Volunteered geographic information,,,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/2/2/276/htm https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi2020276 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ijgi/ijgi2.html#Canavosio-ZuzelskiAD13 https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/2/2/276/pdf https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013IJGI....2..276C/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi2020276,10.3390/ijgi2020276,2018463030,,0,007-854-242-819-750; 011-567-887-224-394; 015-525-637-992-606; 026-645-756-189-301; 029-688-231-861-301; 030-217-575-405-566; 032-953-260-643-162; 038-976-596-179-447; 039-429-815-992-31X; 045-701-024-430-086; 045-755-847-822-287; 057-175-571-636-241; 057-545-918-303-995; 069-146-006-064-335; 103-830-447-132-833; 120-348-450-238-234; 120-572-254-253-660; 124-061-530-692-848; 138-847-225-776-212; 144-834-086-453-740; 159-943-165-088-603; 166-852-791-739-426; 170-875-508-164-337; 173-701-594-641-45X; 192-089-349-037-735,20,,(magid) 2018463030; (coreid) 28426198; (doi) 10.3390/ijgi2020276,en
023-372-294-408-871,Quantifying Flood Water Levels Using Image-Based Volunteered Geographic Information,2020-02-21,2020,journal article,Remote Sensing,20724292,MDPI AG,Switzerland,Yan Ting Lin; Ming-Der Yang; Jen-Yu Han; Yuan-Fong Su; Jiun Huei Jang,"<jats:p>Many people use smartphone cameras to record their living environments through captured images, and share aspects of their daily lives on social networks, such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. These platforms provide volunteered geographic information (VGI), which enables the public to know where and when events occur. At the same time, image-based VGI can also indicate environmental changes and disaster conditions, such as flooding ranges and relative water levels. However, little image-based VGI has been applied for the quantification of flooding water levels because of the difficulty of identifying water lines in image-based VGI and linking them to detailed terrain models. In this study, flood detection has been achieved through image-based VGI obtained by smartphone cameras. Digital image processing and a photogrammetric method were presented to determine the water levels. In digital image processing, the random forest classification was applied to simplify ambient complexity and highlight certain aspects of flooding regions, and the HT-Canny method was used to detect the flooding line of the classified image-based VGI. Through the photogrammetric method and a fine-resolution digital elevation model based on the unmanned aerial vehicle mapping technique, the detected flooding lines were employed to determine water levels. Based on the results of image-based VGI experiments, the proposed approach identified water levels during an urban flood event in Taipei City for demonstration. Notably, classified images were produced using random forest supervised classification for a total of three classes with an average overall accuracy of 88.05%. The quantified water levels with a resolution of centimeters (&lt;3-cm difference on average) can validate flood modeling so as to extend point-basis observations to area-basis estimations. Therefore, the limited performance of image-based VGI quantification has been improved to help in flood disasters. Consequently, the proposed approach using VGI images provides a reliable and effective flood-monitoring technique for disaster management authorities.</jats:p>",12,4,706,,Flood water; Image based; Environmental science; Volunteered geographic information; Cartography,,,,,https://researchoutput.ncku.edu.tw/zh/publications/quantifying-flood-water-levels-using-image-based-volunteered-geog https://doi.org/10.3390/rs12040706 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/remotesensing/remotesensing12.html#LinYHSJ20,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs12040706,10.3390/rs12040706,3007088614,,0,000-958-771-489-242; 002-135-704-523-450; 002-555-907-164-663; 003-404-617-962-913; 003-415-419-649-591; 004-806-499-017-475; 006-381-906-970-012; 008-249-751-134-726; 011-056-974-599-675; 011-535-480-458-942; 011-736-441-907-136; 011-854-399-312-637; 014-000-764-330-818; 016-553-126-571-580; 016-993-963-862-990; 017-465-705-893-310; 020-110-218-876-981; 025-038-008-940-533; 025-757-157-288-447; 026-813-377-082-168; 027-736-997-184-595; 028-495-533-350-163; 030-800-470-784-537; 032-640-154-699-448; 034-414-927-357-560; 038-100-702-021-293; 040-184-564-272-635; 044-311-794-361-849; 047-793-127-061-993; 049-749-795-511-536; 055-474-954-606-979; 061-445-504-147-693; 063-983-168-292-98X; 064-919-906-283-461; 067-697-684-166-435; 069-204-486-700-267; 069-268-212-190-477; 073-593-502-368-329; 073-832-392-652-34X; 075-359-691-361-886; 079-117-605-176-945; 080-101-827-559-027; 087-529-691-896-842; 093-841-024-526-630; 094-455-335-604-756; 098-211-034-015-426; 102-932-854-677-348; 104-185-970-807-791; 108-161-528-629-012; 110-375-191-298-486; 110-434-852-093-742; 112-160-486-845-074; 112-896-130-418-591; 122-195-241-088-178; 123-498-859-171-509; 133-067-125-638-77X; 138-959-118-251-345; 141-113-107-745-808; 161-851-510-585-226; 169-165-992-980-624; 171-545-246-207-265; 192-714-059-570-954,4,,(doi) 10.3390/rs12040706; (magid) 3007088614,zh_cht

These, in a nutshell, are just a few of the data concerning the XX Olympic and the IX Paralympic Winter Games, Torino, Italy, 2006. Such a huge event, obviously required a meticulously organized medical service to cope with the healthcare of the athletes, official workers and the Olympic family, distributed over a geographic area of approximately 80 km in diameter. An ENT service was organized within the medical service, which was divided between 3 Polyclinics, in which 12 ENT Specialists were on duty. The present report gives an account of the final data concerning the service involved, together with a description of the approach used in the actual organization, with a view to providing useful information for colleagues who will be called upon, for a similar service, in future Olympic Winter Games. The ENT healthcare offered was confirmed to be proportional to the requirements, both from a qualitative and quantitative point of view. All the ENT specialists involved, reported having gained an immense store of human experience from having lived the Olympic atmosphere as a volunteer exerting one's own profession. The facilities available in the Polyclinics, which were at a considerable distance from the Hospital, were found to be more than adequate with respect to the pathological conditions and service requested, particularly in 17% of the cases which would otherwise have been sent to a Hospital Outpatient Unit at least 80 km away.",28,3,101,109,Health care; Euros; Duty; Athletes; Health services; Geographic area; Competitive behavior; Public relations; Medicine,,Competitive Behavior; Health Services/supply & distribution; Humans; International Cooperation; Italy; Otolaryngology/methods; Otorhinolaryngologic Diseases/epidemiology; Prevalence; Seasons; Sports,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2644984/ http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC2644984 https://www.actaitalica.it/issues/2008/3-08/succo.pdf https://moh-it.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/torino-2006-xx-olympic-and-ix-paralympic-winter-games-the-ent-exp,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18646571,,2108399628,PMC2644984,0,001-750-854-644-643; 016-227-622-699-280; 024-330-557-368-578; 029-738-939-744-349; 035-274-120-935-686; 044-389-102-950-635; 046-036-473-466-69X; 072-449-905-448-507; 084-645-115-916-891; 151-167-919-541-145,3,,(pmcid) pmc2644984; (magid) 2108399628; (pmid) 18646571,en

Using VGI and social media activity data, this article developed a method to automatically extract and identify urban spatial patterns and functional zones. The method is put forward based on the case of Beijing, China, and includes the following three steps: (1) Obtain multi-source urban spatial data, such as Weibo data (equivalent to Twitter in Chinese), OpenStreetMap, population data, etc.; (2) Use the hierarchical clustering algorithm, term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) method, and improved k-means clustering algorithms to identify functional zones; (3) Compare the identified results with the actual urban land uses and verify its accuracy.

Recommendations to cities promoting walking to school are (1) base interventions on the existing network of schools and adapt the provision to other local organizations, (2) establish safety measures, and (3) respond specifically to local characteristics.

Loai Ali; Falko Schmid; Zoe Falomir; Christian Freksa,"<jats:p>Abstract. Crowd-sourcing, especially in form of Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) significantly changed the way geographic data is collected and the products that are generated from them. In VGI projects, contributors’ heterogeneity fosters rich data sources, however with problematic quality. In this paper, we tackle data quality from a classification perspective. Particularly in VGI, data classification presents some challenges: In some cases, the classification of entities depends on individual conceptualization about the environment. Whereas in other cases, a geographic feature itself might have ambiguous characteristics. These problems lead to inconsistent and inappropriate classifications. To face these challenges, we propose a guided classification approach. The approach employs data mining algorithms to develop a classifier, through investigating the geographic characteristics of target feature classes. The developed classifier acts to distinguish between related classes like forest, meadow and park. Then, the classifier could be used to guide the contributors during the classification process. The findings of an empirical study illustrate that the developed classifier correctly predict some classes. However, it still has a limited accuracy with other related classes.;                     </jats:p>",II-3/W5,,211,217,Empirical research; Information retrieval; Data quality; Data classification; Classifier (linguistics); Data mining algorithm; Geographic feature; Computer science; Volunteered geographic information; Conceptualization,,,,,https://doaj.org/article/d892c8d7cdd6433aa7e50888e3fa0dd1 http://www.isprs-ann-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/II-3-W5/211/2015/ https://www.isprs-ann-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/II-3-W5/211/2015/isprsannals-II-3-W5-211-2015.pdf https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ISPAn.II3..211L/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/isprsannals-ii-3-w5-211-2015,10.5194/isprsannals-ii-3-w5-211-2015,2286578449,,0,006-057-019-890-636; 006-408-131-340-003; 007-684-128-166-136; 008-655-662-451-459; 022-473-450-579-960; 027-666-068-785-379; 029-963-409-674-751; 030-975-962-975-895; 031-636-768-715-141; 033-635-116-524-700; 034-481-759-393-510; 038-976-596-179-447; 040-267-517-107-219; 041-658-614-339-032; 041-793-028-069-027; 048-702-561-381-148; 051-285-080-856-898; 057-545-918-303-995; 062-441-104-889-477; 067-793-529-827-539; 071-490-604-491-921; 088-339-711-439-200; 094-336-360-386-20X; 095-607-318-877-177; 097-338-432-344-323; 097-612-174-011-049; 123-071-990-086-470; 145-350-454-429-564; 147-876-713-700-216; 150-682-937-572-48X,6,,(doi) 10.5194/isprsannals-ii-3-w5-211-2015; (magid) 2286578449; (coreid) 91668101,en

During this time, the nature of VGI has been evolving, with new types and sources of data continually being added. In light of this trend, this paper explores one such type of VGI data: Volunteered Street View Imagery (VSVI). Two VSVI sources, Mapillary and OpenStreetCam, were extracted and analyzed to study road coverage and contribution patterns for four US metropolitan areas. Results show that coverage patterns vary across sites, with most contributions occurring along local roads and in populated areas. We also found that a few users contributed most of the data. Moreover, the results suggest that most data are being collected during three distinct times of day (i.e., morning, lunch and late afternoon). The paper concludes with a discussion that while VSVI data is still relatively new, it has the potential to be a rich source of spatial and temporal information for monitoring cities.</jats:p>",9,6,341,,Metropolitan area; Geography; Late afternoon; Temporal information; Volunteered geographic information; Cartography; Crowdsourcing,,,,,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020IJGI....9..341M/abstract https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/9/6/341 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ijgi/ijgi9.html#MahabirSCCS20 https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi9060341 https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/9/6/341/pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi9060341,10.3390/ijgi9060341,3030624209,,0,000-523-165-640-923; 004-205-506-532-712; 004-237-307-047-366; 004-836-286-822-531; 005-222-101-092-166; 006-881-687-694-396; 008-127-307-013-236; 009-606-024-893-450; 012-516-254-994-918; 020-132-620-861-048; 021-041-484-242-674; 022-267-756-409-094; 023-764-343-000-235; 026-553-040-934-312; 026-839-507-648-103; 027-979-325-696-455; 031-450-942-446-667; 035-840-514-116-556; 038-976-596-179-447; 039-499-260-186-536; 041-545-489-602-776; 043-093-687-022-746; 046-147-535-387-535; 049-283-737-018-880; 050-054-324-728-688; 051-114-728-459-021; 052-200-840-177-558; 053-668-765-543-510; 057-545-918-303-995; 062-502-142-237-10X; 062-851-465-159-260; 063-905-585-038-831; 065-162-988-058-755; 065-487-565-021-294; 067-692-042-057-920; 068-733-865-752-101; 074-774-339-923-765; 080-549-909-944-047; 080-991-010-602-323; 081-686-689-177-807; 084-840-578-733-040; 089-834-504-117-385; 090-605-464-863-952; 093-701-157-926-086; 102-390-296-316-869; 102-849-677-910-286; 104-777-046-440-225; 111-289-249-059-150; 122-580-797-379-967; 126-576-668-406-897; 128-630-302-259-009; 131-426-381-623-381; 149-270-292-786-600; 157-938-773-279-404; 162-906-737-836-677; 164-195-973-903-936; 177-134-983-663-65X; 191-482-485-372-989,2,,(magid) 3030624209; (doi) 10.3390/ijgi9060341,en
025-311-923-106-336,A National Registry for Healthy Volunteers in Phase 1 Clinical Trials,2011-03-15,2011,journal article,JAMA,15383598; 00987484,American Medical Association,United States,David B. Resnik; Greg Koski,"Each year, thousands of individuals in the United States enroll in phase 1 drug trials as healthy volunteers to earn money. Payments for participation range from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars.1 Some individuals have enrolled in as many as 80 phase 1 studies.2 Professional research participants have developed their own social networks, Web pages, associations, and publications, which they use to learn about new studies, share information and experiences, and understand the ethical, regulatory, and scientific aspects of clinical research.1 Some individuals pursue research participation as a full-time job and travel across the country enrolling in studies.1 One person claims he earned $32 000 in 2008.2; ; A significant risk of participating in a phase 1 drug trial is the possibility of a dangerous interaction between an investigational agent and another medication the participant is currently taking or has taken recently.3 This risk is especially great in phase 1 studies designed to induce toxicity to determine the maximum tolerable dose.3 Also, recent participation in another study can skew safety data. Most investigators minimize risks and reduce bias by excluding volunteers from phase 1 drug studies who have recently participated in another phase 1 trial. In the United States, the standard interval is 30 days.3 Although most drugs are eliminated from the body sooner than this, the 30-day interval is a standard safety measure, because some individuals may metabolize or eliminate drugs more slowly than others. Ideally, the protocol should specify an appropriate waiting period based on the half-life of the test agent, because in some cases, the interval may need to be longer than 30 days.; ; Although a waiting period for participation in phase 1 studies is necessary to ensure participant safety and data integrity, professional volunteers have a strong financial incentive to conceal recent or even current enrollment in phase 1 studies. One volunteer admitted that he often flouts the 30-day rule.2 While the incidence of adverse drug reactions from overlapping trial enrollment is presumed to be rare, it may be underreported because participants who experience adverse drug reactions might not inform investigators making adverse event reports, to avoid jeopardizing their current or future enrollments.1; ; Because professional research participants may not disclose their enrollment in recent phase 1 studies, the United States should consider developing a national registry for healthy volunteers in such studies to protect participants from the risks of overlapping enrollment and to promote data integrity. Minimizing risks related to research participation is one of the fundamental ethical and legal requirements for research with human participants.4 All participants in phase 1 studies enrolling healthy volunteers deserve to be protected from the risks of overlapping enrollment, even those who make false statements about their prior study participation.; ; Several countries already have such registries. For example, France has had a national registry for healthy volunteers participating in clinical research studies since the early 1990s.5 In the United Kingdom, The Over Volunteering Prevention System (TOPS) database prevents healthy volunteers from participating too often in trials of new medicines.6 Research institutions in Canton Ticino, Switzerland, have also developed a registry for healthy volunteers to prevent individuals from enrolling in more than 1 study at a time.7; ; Registries also have been implemented in parts of the United States. In 2008, 5 research sites in South Florida developed a human participant registry to address the problem of overlapping enrollment in phase 1 studies. During the initial 18-week data collection period, 2081 individuals attempted to enroll in 27 phase 1 studies. Of these individuals, 50 (2.4%) attempted to enroll in another study within 30 days of receiving an investigational agent in a previous study, and 186 (8.9%) attempted to enroll within 60 days. Participants attempted to enroll within the 30-day period even though they were informed of the existence of the registry and the exclusion criteria.8 That a substantial percentage of individuals attempted to violate the 30-day waiting period suggests that overlapping enrollment in phase 1 studies is potentially a significant concern in the United States.; ; Although local registries can be implemented quickly, they can be circumvented because of geographic limitations. To adequately deal with the problem of overlapping enrollment, a national registry is needed. The registry should be linked to databases that provide investigators with important information related to the studies in which an individual has participated, such as interventions, drugs, estimated duration of the research, and contact information. Costs would be modest and could be financed by fees from study sponsors. Federal agencies that regulate or sponsor research with human participants, such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and National Institutes of Health (NIH), could make participation in the national registry a requirement for conducting a phase 1 trial enrolling healthy volunteers. The registry could be administered by the FDA or NIH.; ; Minimal identifying information would be required to prevent overlapping enrollment. The South Florida registry collects each study participant's initials and date of birth as well as the last 4 digits of his or her Social Security number and a fingerprint. The only information TOPS collects is a national insurance number for UK citizens or a passport number for noncitizens. A registry must use measures to protect confidentiality of the data, such as encryption, secure storage, and restricted access to prevent unauthorized use. If the registry contains no personal health information, it would not necessarily need to meet the privacy protections required by the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act, but it could be subject to the provisions of 21 CFR Part 11.9 Information about the registry would need to be included in protocols submitted to the study's institutional review board and in consent documents.; ; Some might argue that a research participant registry is not necessary because adequate safety measures are already in place to deal with the problem of overlapping enrollment. However, data suggest that overlapping enrollment is a significant problem in phase 1 studies involving healthy volunteers,1,2 and it may become worse if the ranks of professional research participants increase. Others might argue that overlapping enrollment can be significantly reduced by taking away the financial incentive to cheat the system and not paying individuals for participating in these studies. However, it is unlikely that phase 1 studies enrolling healthy volunteers could achieve enrollment goals without offering participants a financial reward, because that is the main reason most individuals participate in such research.10 A national safety registry for study participants is a simple, straightforward way to minimize the risks and biases associated with overlapping enrollment in phase 1 studies and can be implemented at a low cost with minimal additional burden on investigators or sponsors.",305,12,1236,1237,Psychological intervention; National Insurance; Institutional review board; Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act; Research participant; Social Security number; Incentive; Family medicine; Confidentiality; Medicine,,"Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic; Drug Interactions; Drug Therapy; Occupations; Patient Selection; Registries; Reproducibility of Results; Research Subjects/economics; Time Factors; United States",,Intramural NIH HHS (ZIA ES102646-01) United States; Intramural NIH HHS (ZIA ES102646-02) United States,http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3094908 https://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=646205 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21406636 https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/646205,http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jama.2011.354,10.1001/jama.2011.354,2009994290,PMC3094908,0,019-235-834-419-876; 030-504-672-991-909; 038-921-671-904-824; 046-007-193-475-265; 061-476-835-204-148; 063-031-285-631-217; 065-307-797-579-528; 154-094-045-264-46X; 168-933-391-449-953; 197-799-021-343-059,34,"research support, n.i.h., extramural",(pmcid) pmc3094908; (doi) 10.1001/jama.2011.354; (pii) jama.2011.354; (pmid) 21406636; (magid) 2009994290,en

Jesse Shapiro,"<AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"">The human gut microbiome represents a diverse microbial community that varies across individuals and populations, and is influenced by factors such as host genetics and lifestyle. Diet is a major force shaping the gut microbiome, and the effects of dietary choices on microbiome composition are well documented. However, it remains poorly known how natural temporal variation in diet can affect the microbiome. The traditional Inuit diet is primarily based on animal products, which are thought to vary seasonally according to prey availability. We previously investigated the Inuit gut microbiome sampled at a single time point, and found no detectable differences in overall microbiome community composition attributable to the traditional Inuit diet.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">To determine whether seasonal changes in the Inuit diet might induce more pronounced changes in the microbiome, we collected stool and toilet paper samples, and dietary information from Inuit volunteers living in Resolute Bay (Nunavut, Canada), and compared them to individuals of European descent living in Montréal (Québec, Canada) consuming a typical Western diet. We sequenced the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene to characterize microbiome diversity and composition, and compared samples collected with toilet paper or from stool. Our results show that these sampling methods provide similar, but non-identical portraits of the microbiome. Based on toilet paper samples, we found that much of the variation in microbiome community composition could be explained by individual identity (45-61% of variation explained, depending on the beta diversity metric used), with small but significant variation (3-5%) explained by sex or geography (Nunavut or Montréal). In contrast with our previous study at one time point, sampling over the course of a year revealed that diet explains 11% of variation in community composition across all participants, and 17% of variation specifically among Nunavut participants. However, we observed no clear seasonal shifts in the microbiomes of participants from either Nunavut or Montréal. Within-individual microbial diversity fluctuated more over time in Nunavut than in Montréal, consistent with a more variable and highly individualized diet in Nunavut.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">Together, these results shows that the traditional Inuit diet and lifestyle has an impact on the composition, diversity and stability of the Inuit gut microbiome, even if the seasonality of the diet is less pronounced than expected, perhaps due to an increasingly westernized diet.</AbstractText>",5,1,151,151,Seasonality; Microbiome; Ecology; Beta diversity; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Western diet; Gut microbiome; Feces; Microbial ecology; Biology; Zoology,16S rRNA gene; Dietary transition; Gut microbiome; Inuit traditional diet; Temporal variation; Western diet,"Adult; Aged; Bacteria/classification; Canada; Diet; Diet, Western; Feces/microbiology; Feeding Behavior; Female; Food; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Humans; Inuits; Life Style; Male; Middle Aged; Nunavut; Quebec; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Seasons; Specimen Handling/methods","RNA, Ribosomal, 16S",Canada Research Chairs; Fonds Québécois de la Recherche sur la Nature et les Technologies; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Northern Scientific Training Program,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40168-017-0370-7 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/29145891 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186%2Fs40168-017-0370-7.pdf https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-017-0370-7 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29145891,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40168-017-0370-7,10.1186/s40168-017-0370-7,2770160922,PMC5689144,0,002-001-597-863-156; 004-824-138-219-863; 005-455-209-939-741; 005-801-820-830-168; 006-347-183-323-970; 009-041-886-057-602; 009-656-276-455-057; 013-583-905-272-529; 015-101-263-811-938; 015-267-478-392-873; 016-305-117-891-280; 016-632-084-387-229; 016-726-466-560-012; 020-187-196-715-612; 020-572-293-437-58X; 020-663-516-602-225; 021-439-567-291-113; 021-546-216-828-63X; 023-654-857-042-080; 024-061-124-137-069; 025-633-641-075-81X; 029-045-353-261-225; 030-050-731-171-385; 031-858-853-815-220; 032-103-026-795-044; 038-697-691-962-841; 039-610-105-135-125; 042-879-865-873-809; 043-887-441-220-587; 045-718-647-707-484; 054-420-823-895-694; 055-098-259-934-114; 056-837-094-771-136; 060-497-389-448-711; 063-859-335-396-631; 064-363-266-786-528; 064-638-334-902-296; 068-035-961-078-42X; 068-646-991-287-372; 069-445-837-066-93X; 071-789-403-337-06X; 072-526-719-130-219; 072-847-545-000-63X; 076-686-670-081-724; 077-733-554-441-193; 078-467-043-368-69X; 078-944-828-490-707; 085-982-532-428-163; 088-426-376-730-433; 097-299-802-290-467; 103-339-800-253-151; 107-401-200-001-188; 108-666-961-433-057; 112-397-017-997-396; 113-359-690-858-109; 114-002-663-436-079; 114-251-883-659-335; 125-136-485-192-78X; 137-218-036-878-035; 146-201-610-089-627; 150-161-619-269-318; 153-403-183-987-244; 164-025-285-989-324; 169-638-041-240-599,26,"research support, non-u.s. gov't",(pmcid) pmc5689144; (pmid) 29145891; (magid) 2770160922; (doi) 10.1186/s40168-017-0370-7; (pii) 10.1186/s40168-017-0370-7,en

This paper aims to summarize the different sampling strategies adopted in the second wave of Observation of Cardiovascular Risk Factors (ORISCAV-LUX, 2016–17), with a focus on population coverage and sample representativeness. Data from the first nationwide cross-sectional, population-based ORISCAV-LUX survey, 2007–08 and from the newly complementary sample recruited via different pathways, nine years later were analysed. First, we compare the socio-demographic characteristics and health profiles between baseline participants and non-participants to the second wave. Then, we describe the distribution of subjects across different strategy-specific samples and performed a comparison of the overall ORISCAV-LUX2 sample to the national population according to stratification criteria. For the baseline sample (1209 subjects), the participants (660) were younger than the non-participants (549), with a significant difference in average ages (44 vs 45.8 years; P = 0.019). There was a significant difference in terms of education level (P < 0.0001), 218 (33%) participants having university qualification vs. 95 (18%) non-participants. The participants seemed having better health perception (p < 0.0001); 455 (70.3%) self-reported good or very good health perception compared to 312 (58.2%) non-participants. The prevalence of obesity (P < 0.0001), hypertension (P < 0.0001), diabetes (P = 0.007), and mean values of related biomarkers were significantly higher among the non-participants. The overall sample (1558 participants) was mainly composed of randomly selected subjects, including 660 from the baseline sample and 455 from other health examination survey sample and 269 from civil registry sample (constituting in total 88.8%), against only 174 volunteers (11.2%), with significantly different characteristics and health status. The ORISCAV-LUX2 sample was representative of national population for geographical district, but not for sex and age; the younger (25–34 years) and older (65–79 years) being underrepresented, whereas middle-aged adults being over-represented, with significant sex-specific difference (p < 0.0001). This study represents a careful first-stage analysis of the ORISCAV-LUX2 sample, based on available information on participants and non-participants. The ORISCAV-LUX datasets represents a relevant tool for epidemiological research and a basis for health monitoring and evidence-based prevention of cardiometabolic risk in Luxembourg.",19,1,1,10,Epidemiology; Data collection; Demography; Population; Cardiometabolic risk; Cardiovascular risk factors; Sample representativeness; Obesity; Medicine; Sampling (statistics),"Epidemiology; Follow-up studies, population health; Population-based study; Sample representativeness",Adult; Cardiovascular Diseases/diagnosis; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Surveys/statistics & numerical data; Humans; Luxembourg/epidemiology; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Participation/statistics & numerical data; Patient Selection; Prevalence; Risk Factors,,Ministère de l'Enseignement Supérieur et de la Recherche,https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-019-0669-0 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30717671 https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12874-019-0669-0 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186%2Fs12874-019-0669-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12874-019-0669-0,10.1186/s12874-019-0669-0,2925234113,PMC6360765,0,001-380-244-604-737; 008-104-446-407-276; 016-278-915-520-109; 017-725-503-169-20X; 020-313-358-347-475; 022-906-327-969-366; 026-344-075-946-961; 032-788-022-499-322; 038-023-728-163-752; 041-565-444-258-244; 043-354-533-380-666; 044-225-253-511-137; 044-968-133-129-440; 048-883-529-839-601; 049-287-258-180-889; 049-863-018-288-383; 051-132-840-114-196; 058-566-122-290-841; 059-402-751-833-592; 063-849-953-282-19X; 075-593-140-205-874; 091-994-884-209-816; 093-055-056-446-151; 094-758-979-094-868; 104-605-621-846-133; 115-214-260-037-98X; 116-499-630-550-595; 123-270-618-727-229,1,"research support, non-u.s. gov't",(doi) 10.1186/s12874-019-0669-0; (pii) 10.1186/s12874-019-0669-0; (magid) 2925234113; (pmcid) pmc6360765; (pmid) 30717671,en

D. Yilma,"<jats:p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract.&lt;/strong&gt; During the past few years much effort has been put into developing community-based methods to capture and analyze a large amount of data in a systematic manner. This new source of geo-referenced data could be very important throughout Africa where crowd sourcing activities or volunteered geographic information (VGI) enhance participation and decision making based on local knowledge. VGI has the potential to be a significant source of information for a variety of applications. It will especially help national mapping authorities to build and update their national geospatial datasets, and improve the availability and currency of the countries fundamental and thematic datasets. Governments therefore need to take proactive measures to develop strategies maximizing on the opportunity in the current technological development. This calls out the need to developing strategic guidance on how to strengthen the communities’ participation in data collection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United Nations Economic commission for Africa developed a document on the best practices and principles for adopting community mapping and VGI in the mapping practices in Africa. An expert group meeting is held to gather experts in the field to discuss on the issues, review best practices and current status on citizen participation in community mapping and to develop a roadmap for the adoption of the technology and agree on the guiding principles. The outcome of the meeting resulted in the framing of guiding principles for community mapping which is published in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This paper therefore provides overview of VGI in Africa and the efforts made to date.&lt;/p&gt;;                     </jats:p>",XLII-2/W13,,1615,1620,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-xlii-2-w13-1615-2019,10.5194/isprs-archives-xlii-2-w13-1615-2019,,,0,,1,,(doi) 10.5194/isprs-archives-xlii-2-w13-1615-2019,tl

In the first part of the paper, a significant number of studies was evaluated, and the technique was thoroughly described to set up a base level for further research. At this moment, the most used input data for heat maps are point data. While these data fit the method very well, also studies based on line and polygon data were found. The second part of the paper is devoted to an exploratory study on traffic accident data of the Olomouc city, Czech Republic. Even spatial distribution of the dataset by geographical information system makes it the perfect example of heat map usage. These data were visualized in multiple ways changing color range, kernel size, radius, and transparency. Two groups of users were created in order to evaluate these heat maps. One group was consisting of those educated or working in cartography. The second one was consisting of the general public. Created heat maps were shown to these volunteers and their task was to decide their preferred solution. Most of the users chose bright colors with a negative feeling, such as red, for traffic accident visualization. The best settings for transparency was identified to be around 50%. The final questions were about map readability based on radius. This setting is tied to map scale but follows a common trend throughout the research. The results of this work are a general set of recommendations and specific evaluation of the exploratory study regarding traffic accidents spatial data. The general recommendations include basic principles of the method, implementation by GIS, suitable data and correct usage of heat maps. The evaluation is answering specific questions regarding heat map settings, style and presentation in the specific case.</jats:p>",10,1,367,384,Information system; Transport engineering; Traffic accident; Visualization; Computer science; Exploratory research,,,,,http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018OGeo...10...29N/abstract https://www.degruyter.com/view/journals/geo/10/1/article-p367.xml?language=en,http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/geo-2018-0029,10.1515/geo-2018-0029,2887451971,,0,000-301-572-947-611; 006-611-076-501-970; 014-544-113-495-227; 021-752-603-570-840; 032-145-306-973-509; 040-612-337-798-037; 043-557-091-741-339; 044-959-485-802-171; 050-324-874-448-944; 051-254-947-000-266; 058-413-848-496-139; 060-013-585-231-946; 061-287-475-128-838; 072-322-248-811-119; 073-133-314-418-766; 073-926-185-210-482; 079-668-341-081-109; 086-375-149-894-067; 089-462-908-421-768; 091-710-663-456-170; 107-151-553-552-816; 112-269-418-579-80X; 124-180-519-369-654; 126-199-063-117-32X; 140-158-064-733-534; 140-971-071-079-771; 171-891-212-914-721,15,,(doi) 10.1515/geo-2018-0029; (magid) 2887451971,en

Camargo; Jonathan Bright; Scott A. Hale,"Accurate modelling of local population movement patterns is a core, contemporary concern for urban policymakers, affecting both the short-term deployment of public transport resources and the longer-term planning of transport infrastructure. Yet, while macro-level population movement models (such as the gravity and radiation models) are well developed, micro-level alternatives are in much shorter supply, with most macro-models known to perform poorly at smaller geographical scales. In this paper, we take a first step to remedy this deficit, by leveraging two novel datasets to analyse where and why macro-level models of human mobility break down. We show how freely available data from OpenStreetMap concerning land use composition of different areas around the county of Oxfordshire in the UK can be used to diagnose mobility models and understand the types of trips they over- and underestimate when compared with empirical volumes derived from aggregated, anonymous smartphone location data. We argue for new modelling strategies that move beyond rough heuristics such as distance and population towards a detailed, granular understanding of the opportunities presented in different regions.",6,11,191034,,Software deployment; Mobility model; Geography; Open data; Local population; Land use; Public transport; Environmental planning,OpenStreetMap; human mobility; land use; open data; traffic models,,,Natural Environment Research Council; Lloyd's Register Foundation; InnovateUK,https://www.arxiv-vanity.com/papers/1905.07964/ https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.191034 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31827843 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1905.html#abs-1905-07964,http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsos.191034,10.1098/rsos.191034,2987302306,PMC6894559,0,001-873-157-030-785; 006-635-222-145-393; 007-052-221-075-524; 007-503-121-649-498; 013-445-037-365-411; 014-580-697-437-060; 015-986-975-678-62X; 020-132-620-861-048; 023-485-440-841-712; 023-863-596-799-317; 025-670-117-400-666; 025-905-251-162-252; 027-108-336-376-082; 029-020-548-249-508; 030-217-575-405-566; 031-931-488-038-539; 032-000-437-839-214; 035-577-047-601-038; 036-796-858-838-895; 037-050-535-204-295; 038-339-252-539-742; 038-976-596-179-447; 044-563-873-269-101; 052-200-840-177-558; 056-633-878-647-139; 057-258-043-171-640; 060-288-645-112-192; 060-303-615-333-085; 064-720-878-275-561; 065-123-979-139-260; 065-914-677-166-600; 067-239-136-983-225; 071-978-153-501-690; 073-480-282-116-582; 077-359-509-902-504; 077-646-788-395-710; 078-141-527-597-27X; 081-782-857-993-644; 082-014-960-103-720; 085-802-160-396-381; 088-339-711-439-200; 103-642-795-735-19X; 111-126-147-703-017; 123-275-222-285-877; 123-790-265-542-091; 129-790-932-928-886; 134-831-777-616-08X; 146-806-833-677-700; 149-266-632-136-785; 156-254-079-886-227; 164-079-790-424-029; 166-713-161-186-468; 190-065-916-547-91X,4,,(magid) 2987302306; (doi) 10.1098/rsos.191034; (pmid) 31827843; (pii) rsos191034; (pmcid) pmc6894559,en

However, little attention is given to understanding what factors, beyond individuals’ expertise, contribute to the success of VGI. In this chapter we ask whether society and its characteristics such as socio-economic factors have an impact on what part of the physical world is being digitally mapped. This question is necessary, so to understand where crowd-sourced map information can be relied upon (and crucially where not), with direct implications on the design of applications that rely on having complete and unbiased map knowledge.

Mapping the distribution of poverty in developing countries is essential for humanitarian organizations and policymakers to formulate targeted programs and aid. However, traditional methods for obtaining socioeconomic data can be time-consuming, expensive, and labor-intensive. Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of combining machine learning and satellite images to estimate wealth in sub-Saharan African countries (Xie et al., 2016, Jean et al., 2016). In this study, we investigate the extent to which this method can be applied in the context of the Philippine archipelago to predict four different socioeconomic indicators: wealth level, years of education, access to electricity, and access to water. We also propose an alternative, cost-effective approach that leverages a combination of volunteered geographic information from OpenStreetMap and nighttime lights satellite imagery for estimating socioeconomic indicators. The best models, which incorporate regional indicators as predictors, explain approximately 63% of the variation in asset-based wealth. Our findings also indicate that models trained on publicly available, volunteer-curated geographic data achieve the same predictive performance as that of models trained using proprietary satellite images.;                     </jats:p>",XLII-4/W19,,425,431,Deep learning; Machine learning; Socioeconomic status; Transfer of learning; Artificial intelligence; Poverty; Geography; Satellite imagery; Volunteered geographic information; Developing country; Geospatial analysis,,,,,https://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/XLII-4-W19/425/2019/isprs-archives-XLII-4-W19-425-2019.pdf https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ISPAr42W19..425/abstract https://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/XLII-4-W19/425/2019/,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-xlii-4-w19-425-2019,10.5194/isprs-archives-xlii-4-w19-425-2019,2997208123,,0,,5,,(magid) 2997208123; (doi) 10.5194/isprs-archives-xlii-4-w19-425-2019,en

Studies have analysed the quality of volunteered geographic information (VGI) datasets, assessing the positional accuracy of features and the completeness of specific attributes. While it has been shown that VGI can, in some context, reach a high positional accuracy, these works have also highlighted a large spatial heterogeneity in positional accuracy, completeness but also with regards to the semantics of the objects. Such high semantic heterogeneity of VGI datasets becomes a significant obstacle to a number of possible uses that could be made of the data. This paper proposes an approach for both improving the semantic quality and reducing the semantic heterogeneity of VGI dat asets. The improvement of the semantic quality is achieved by automatically suggesting attributes to contributors during the editing process. The reduction of semantic heterogeneity is achieved by automatically notifying contributors when two attributes are too similar or too dissimilar. The approach was implemented into a plugin for OpenStreetMap and different examples illustrate how this plugin can be used to improve the quality of VGI data.",XL-2/W1,1,143,148,Semantics; Semantic similarity; Spatial heterogeneity; Information retrieval; Data quality; Semantic heterogeneity; Completeness (statistics); Computer science; Plug-in; Volunteered geographic information,,,,,https://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/XL-2-W1/143/2013/isprsarchives-XL-2-W1-143-2013.pdf https://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/XL-2-W1/143/2013/ https://noa.gwlb.de/receive/cop_mods_00022741 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ISPAr.XL2a.143V/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/isprsarchives-xl-2-w1-143-2013,10.5194/isprsarchives-xl-2-w1-143-2013,2165445075,,0,001-173-413-824-668; 008-655-662-451-459; 008-714-358-699-609; 017-614-610-102-13X; 026-645-756-189-301; 029-963-409-674-751; 029-965-425-507-24X; 040-267-517-107-219; 041-658-614-339-032; 057-545-918-303-995; 071-490-604-491-921; 079-206-649-149-003; 083-390-104-481-847; 086-329-388-138-19X; 088-339-711-439-200; 094-288-127-563-800; 097-338-432-344-323; 097-612-174-011-049; 097-773-332-306-457; 115-156-765-087-939; 147-876-713-700-216; 169-004-007-623-620,17,,(magid) 2165445075; (doi) 10.5194/isprsarchives-xl-2-w1-143-2013; (coreid) 91974521,en

With the growth and advancements in mobile technologies, the Internet, and Web 2.0 technologies users are not only consumers of news, but also producers of online content. This has resulted in a novel and highly participatory cyber-physical news awareness ecosystem that fosters digital activism, in which volunteers contribute content to online communities. While studies have examined the various components of this news awareness ecosystem, little is still known about how news media coverage (and in particular digital media) impacts digital activism. In order to address this challenge and develop a greater understanding of it, this paper focuses on a specific form of digital activism, that of the production of digital geographical content through crowdsourcing efforts. Using refugee camps from around the world as a case study, we examine the relationship between news coverage (via Google news), search trends (via Google trends) and user edit contribution patterns in OpenStreetMap, a prominent geospatial data crowdsourcing platform. In addition, we compare and contrast these patterns with user edit patterns in Wikipedia, a well-known non-geospatial crowdsourcing platform. Using Google news and Google trends to derive a measure of thematic public awareness, our findings indicate that digital activism bursts tend to take place during periods of sustained build-up of public awareness deficit or surplus. These findings are in line with two prominent mass communication theories: agenda setting and corrective action, and suggest the emergence of a novel stimulus-awareness-activism framework in today's participatory digital age. Moreover, these findings further complement existing research examining the motivational factors that drive users to contribute to online collaborative communities. This paper brings us one step closer to understanding the underlying mechanisms that drive digital activism in particular in the geospatial domain.",13,11,e0206825,,Internet privacy; The Internet; Digital media; Political science; Citizen journalism; Social media; News media; Mobile technology; Crowdsourcing; Geospatial analysis,,Communication; Geography; Humans; Internet; Mass Media; Refugee Camps; Volunteers,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0206825 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018PLoSO..1306825M/abstract https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30408059 https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0206825,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0206825,10.1371/journal.pone.0206825,2900024009,PMC6226103,0,000-156-762-475-258; 000-841-397-940-136; 003-758-424-621-002; 004-044-614-458-455; 004-406-113-251-718; 005-911-351-463-576; 006-986-038-886-364; 008-175-680-479-428; 008-714-358-699-609; 010-242-782-778-938; 014-282-632-058-662; 014-425-368-123-634; 015-814-308-801-128; 019-918-406-817-766; 021-041-484-242-674; 021-250-046-772-166; 023-047-213-485-308; 025-003-320-349-780; 025-173-679-095-651; 026-839-507-648-103; 027-108-336-376-082; 029-483-592-645-517; 029-838-085-368-578; 031-450-942-446-667; 031-989-103-253-935; 032-098-616-798-946; 034-212-540-698-648; 038-976-596-179-447; 041-216-566-003-260; 042-768-442-032-678; 045-109-138-021-608; 045-258-513-547-978; 046-509-496-371-690; 047-345-482-219-207; 047-978-080-963-738; 050-166-777-818-228; 050-763-536-547-91X; 051-752-128-129-578; 053-163-523-125-558; 053-277-235-378-169; 053-284-939-450-881; 053-581-260-952-157; 053-620-292-475-147; 053-760-242-491-32X; 054-077-900-571-47X; 057-776-776-296-002; 058-603-050-068-490; 060-043-555-702-732; 060-647-054-175-919; 060-698-992-019-381; 063-590-498-525-638; 063-809-067-660-401; 063-971-154-016-775; 067-692-042-057-920; 069-078-486-662-155; 070-958-806-140-892; 072-782-620-602-784; 074-301-114-189-168; 077-048-071-673-998; 078-924-439-043-390; 079-836-800-478-181; 081-913-864-796-435; 082-760-902-603-182; 083-673-202-113-01X; 086-965-278-587-282; 091-443-458-261-338; 093-372-586-597-116; 096-425-905-384-43X; 096-895-399-512-668; 097-555-240-980-625; 100-012-798-681-910; 102-167-356-448-598; 103-126-821-145-716; 103-232-743-277-121; 105-604-468-103-297; 105-683-084-736-608; 105-788-258-962-068; 106-264-944-278-433; 107-810-139-791-092; 108-302-373-472-773; 110-742-997-008-478; 117-345-101-686-870; 117-889-713-446-267; 125-834-898-518-520; 126-038-885-781-767; 126-622-378-977-047; 135-315-223-941-716; 136-270-682-975-990; 137-771-059-235-159; 138-343-025-816-073; 139-731-269-678-261; 166-882-054-194-734; 168-706-880-364-117; 169-004-007-623-620; 172-555-895-270-323; 172-629-054-973-031; 172-875-511-052-662; 172-926-705-236-870; 173-942-778-481-160; 176-486-715-303-642; 181-797-057-406-154; 182-904-634-800-635; 198-122-408-150-421,8,"research support, non-u.s. gov't",(doi) 10.1371/journal.pone.0206825; (magid) 2900024009; (pmid) 30408059; (pii) pone-d-18-00722; (pmcid) pmc6226103,en

The technologies in smartphones allow citizens to act as sensors of their environment, producing and sharing rich spatial data useful for new types of collaborative governance set-ups. Data derived from Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) can support accessible, transparent, democratic, inclusive, and locally-based governance situations of interest to planners, citizens, politicians, and scientists. However, there are still uncertainties about how to actually conduct this in practice. This study explores how social media VGI can be used to document spatial tendencies regarding citizens’ uses and perceptions of urban nature with relevance for urban green space governance. Via the hashtag #sharingcph , created by the City of Copenhagen in 2014, VGI data consisting of geo-referenced images were collected from Instagram, categorised according to their content and analysed according to their spatial distribution patterns. The results show specific spatial distributions of the images and main hotspots. Many possibilities and much potential of using VGI for generating, sharing, visualising and communicating knowledge about citizens’ spatial uses and preferences exist, but as a tool to support scientific and democratic interaction, VGI data is challenged by practical, technical and ethical concerns. More research is needed in order to better understand the usefulness and application of this rich data source to governance.",1,2,1,17,Geography; E-governance; Collaborative governance; Green infrastructure; Corporate governance; Public relations; Urban planning; Social media; Volunteered geographic information; Ecosystem services,,,,,https://www.cogitatiopress.com/urbanplanning/article/view/609 https://econpapers.repec.org/article/cogurbpla/v_3a1_3ay_3a2016_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a1-17.htm https://www.repo.uni-hannover.de/handle/123456789/323 https://www.cogitatiopress.com/urbanplanning/article/download/609/609 https://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/handle/document/54291 https://core.ac.uk/display/52920062 https://ideas.repec.org/a/cog/urbpla/v1y2016i2p1-17.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.17645/up.v1i2.609,10.17645/up.v1i2.609,2417249256,,0,000-762-412-801-711; 002-292-797-382-632; 015-737-038-893-598; 017-729-697-559-131; 020-343-625-653-803; 020-418-156-315-492; 032-419-568-910-87X; 033-930-286-996-227; 044-490-806-685-768; 051-199-207-568-834; 057-545-918-303-995; 057-707-357-066-799; 063-118-362-653-80X; 072-239-178-756-507; 074-359-883-836-974; 074-845-352-838-528; 091-204-512-390-272; 093-587-108-990-94X; 095-014-504-868-510; 101-205-991-858-818; 104-587-476-809-38X; 114-336-180-761-571; 115-308-296-476-340; 118-329-814-294-419; 121-990-114-696-118; 151-763-899-673-255; 172-476-402-232-180,48,,(magid) 2417249256; (doi) 10.17645/up.v1i2.609,en

(UTPress),Canada,Sally Hermansen; Graeme Wynn,"Camosun Bog has existed for approximately two thousand years. Little is known about its use by indigenous people, but it was left essentially undisturbed by European newcomers until the twentieth century. Then, as the population of Vancouver and its neighbouring suburb of Point Grey (amalgamated with Vancouver in 1929) grew almost exponentially, the bog was subject to massively accelerated change. By 1980 it was a tiny, endangered remnant landscape, little understood, and valued even less, until a small group of volunteers constituting the Camosun Bog Restoration Society began to reverse the ravages of the previous seventy-five years. This paper combines careful Geographical Information Systems–based mapping of the bog, using evidence from aerial photographs, the scientific findings of botanists, and interviews with members of the Bog Restoration Society, with research in the City of Vancouver archives and newspaper files to detail the effects of human action upon the bog and to reflect upon what the history of this unique place reveals about changing attitudes toward nature in the city.",34,1,9,27,Bog; Archaeology; Endangered species; Newspaper; Population; Indigenous; History,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/59413643 https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-137764880/reflections-on-the-nature-of-an-urban-bog https://www.erudit.org/en/journals/uhr/2005-v34-n1-uhr0613/1016044ar/ https://www.erudit.org/fr/revues/uhr/2005-v34-n1-uhr0613/1016044ar.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.7202/1016044ar,10.7202/1016044ar,2083309655,,0,,4,,(coreid) 59413643; (magid) 2083309655; (doi) 10.7202/1016044ar,en

Spielman,"Collective intelligence is the idea that under the right circumstances collections of individuals are smarter than even the smartest individuals in the group, that is a group has an “intelligence” that is independent of the intelligence of its members. The ideology of collective intelligence undergirds much of the enthusiasm about the use of “volunteered” or crowd-sourced geographic information. Literature from a variety of fields makes clear that not all groups possess collective intelligence, this article identifies four pre-conditions for the emergence of collective intelligence and then examines the extent to which collectively generated mapping systems satisfy these conditions. However, the “intelligence” collectively generated maps is hard to assess because there are two difficult to reconcile perspectives on map quality – the credibility perspective and the accuracy perspective. Much of the current literature on user-generated maps focuses on assessing the quality of individual contributions.

From the popular OpenStreetMap (OSM) to many citizen science projects and social network platforms, the amount of geographically referenced information that is constantly being generated by citizens is burgeoning. The main issue that continues to hamper the full exploitation of VGI lies in its quality, which is by its nature typically undocumented and can range from very high quality to very poor. A crucial step towards improving VGI quality, which impacts on VGI usability, is the development and adoption of protocols, guidelines and best practices to assist users when collecting VGI. This chapter proposes a generic and flexible protocol for VGI data collection, which can be applied to new as well as to existing projects regardless of the specific type of geospatial information collected. The protocol is meant to balance the contrasting needs of providing VGI contributors with precise and detailed instructions while maintaining and growing the enthusiasm and motivation of contributors. Two real-world applications of the protocol are presented, which guide the collection of VGI in respectively the generation and updating of thematic information in a topographic building database; and the uploading of geotagged photographs for the improvement of land use and land cover maps. Technology is highlighted as a key factor in determining the success of the protocol implementation.",,,223,247,Data collection; Usability; Best practice; Citizen science; Data quality; Data science; Computer science; Volunteered geographic information; Social network; Geospatial analysis,,,,,https://estudogeral.sib.uc.pt/bitstream/10316/47981/1/Chapter%2010_the-relevance-of-protocols-for-vgi-collection.pdf https://vbn.aau.dk/files/272722873/the_relevance_of_protocols_for_vgi_collection.pdf https://www.ubiquitypress.com/site/chapters/e/10.5334/bbf.j/ https://www.ubiquitypress.com/site/chapters/10.5334/bbf.j/ https://vbn.aau.dk/da/publications/the-relevance-of-protocols-for-vgi-collection https://re.public.polimi.it/handle/11311/1053991 https://core.ac.uk/display/154929727 https://estudogeral.sib.uc.pt/handle/10316/47981,http://dx.doi.org/10.5334/bbf.j,10.5334/bbf.j,2755883469,,0,,3,,(doi) 10.5334/bbf.j; (magid) 2755883469,en

Yang; K. Zang; J. Zhou; Hongchao Fan; Bo Mao,"<jats:p>At the present, OpenStreetMap (OSM) is considered as one of the most successful and popular VGI (Volunteered Geographic Information) projects. It provides a platform that all the registered members coming from different areas in the world can cooperate with each other to mapping our world. Besides, OSM attracts more and more people, companies and even the governmental agencies because of its free and open source. Studies have proofed that both the quantity and quality of OSM data in several western countries, i.e. Germany, France and the Netherland are even better than the authority data. In recent years, the quantity of the OSM data and the number of contributors in China increased rapidly, but the overall distribution of OSM data is very fit with the distribution of population and the economic development and it displays an uneven development in different provinces and cities in China. Besides, the state of the OSM in China is just similar to that in Germany in 2010 in terms of data quantity and quality, although China is about 25 times to Germany regarding land area and the smartphone penetration in China and Germany does not have a large distance (51.7&amp;amp;thinsp;% to 68.8&amp;amp;thinsp;%). Why is the development of OSM in China so poor and backward when comparing that with western countries, although the environment in hardware and software in China are similar to the western countries? Attempting to answer this question, this paper presents a user survey in China. Mainly, knowledges and experiences about OSM and OSM contribution were asked in the user survey. The user survey was conducted both by paper and pen and by using online platform. Totally, over 1200 participants with the age range from 15 to 80 and a huge diverse of background took part in the user survey. In this paper, we would like to describe the design of the questions for the user survey at first. Then we will demonstrate the results of the user survey, as well as the analysis and conclusions, which can be drawn from the user survey.;                     </jats:p>",XLII-3,,1525,1531,Regional science; China; Citizen journalism; Geography; Population; Open source; User survey; Large distance; Social research; Volunteered geographic information,,,,,https://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/XLII-3/1525/2018/isprs-archives-XLII-3-1525-2018.pdf https://noa.gwlb.de/receive/cop_mods_00006484 https://core.ac.uk/display/156969841 https://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/XLII-3/1525/2018/ http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ISPAr42.3.1525S/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-xlii-3-1525-2018,10.5194/isprs-archives-xlii-3-1525-2018,2801512640,,0,,2,,(doi) 10.5194/isprs-archives-xlii-3-1525-2018; (magid) 2801512640,en

Contributors to a VGI project are normally free to choose whatever tags they feel are appropriate to annotate or describe a particular geographic object or place. In OpenStreetMap (OSM), the Map Features part of the OSM Wiki serves as the de-facto rulebook or ontology for the annotation of features in OSM. Within Map Features, suggestions and guidance on what combinations of tags to use for certain geographic objects are outlined. In this paper, we consider these suggestions and recommendations and analyse the OSM database for 40 cities around the world to ascertain if contributors to OSM in these urban areas are using this guidance in their tagging practices. Overall, we find that compliance with the suggestions and guidance in Map Features is generally average or poor. This leads us to conclude that contributors in these areas do not always tag features with the same level of annotation. Our paper also confirms anecdotal evidence that OSM Map Features is less influential in how OSM contributors tag objects.",5,12,232,,World Wide Web; Geography; Information retrieval; Ontology; Anecdotal evidence; Annotation; Folksonomy; Geographic object; Volunteered geographic information; Metadata,,,,COST,http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016IJGI....5..232D/abstract https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/6491214 https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/5/12/232 https://re.public.polimi.it/handle/11311/1011298 https://re.public.polimi.it/bitstream/11311/1011298/1/ijgi-05-00232.pdf https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi5120232 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ijgi/ijgi5.html#DavidovicMSM16 https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/5/12/232/pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/80335267,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi5120232,10.3390/ijgi5120232,2559801640,,0,000-701-242-851-10X; 004-965-743-543-468; 012-577-133-665-949; 013-516-235-069-82X; 015-142-302-327-569; 018-086-049-935-186; 019-411-275-579-426; 026-099-385-981-862; 029-018-635-018-764; 030-975-962-975-895; 033-438-105-936-678; 034-212-540-698-648; 041-196-942-730-571; 046-082-447-805-261; 047-071-282-670-380; 052-965-337-190-979; 057-012-745-462-629; 065-481-110-952-933; 067-270-674-961-475; 070-793-272-477-593; 082-654-797-167-817; 092-000-113-443-084; 097-338-432-344-323; 098-565-405-790-308; 117-020-910-971-510; 118-657-001-355-635; 128-630-302-259-009; 129-565-965-182-944; 129-909-646-150-845; 147-213-981-170-541; 147-876-713-700-216; 161-009-342-023-966; 177-613-737-494-721; 190-216-777-739-959,15,,(doi) 10.3390/ijgi5120232; (coreid) 90578060; (magid) 2559801640,it; en

Within the last years, several studies have been published analyzing the positional accuracy of features, completeness of specific attributes, or the topological consistency of line and polygon features. However, most of these studies do not take geographic feature types into account. This is for two reasons. First, and in contrast to street networks, choosing a reference set is difficult. Second, we lack the measures to quantify the degree of feature type miscategorization. In this work, we present a methodology to analyze the spatial-semantic interaction of point features in Volunteered Geographic Information. Feature types in VGI can be considered special in both, the way they are formed and the way they are applied. Given that they reflect community agreement more accurately than top-down approaches, we argue that they should be used as the primary basis for assessing spatial-semantic interaction. We present a case study on a spatial and semantic subset of OpenStreetMap, and introduce a novel semantic similarity measure based on the change history of OpenStreetMap elements. Our results set the stage for systems that assist VGI contributors in suggesting the types of new features, cleaning up existing data, and integrating data from different sources.",,,350,370,Semantic similarity; Point of interest; Point pattern analysis; Polygon; Geography; Information retrieval; Data quality; Data science; Completeness (statistics); Volunteered geographic information; Point process,,,,,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-23196-4_19 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-23196-4_19 https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-23196-4_19 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/cosit/cosit2011.html#MulligannJYL11,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-23196-4_19,10.1007/978-3-642-23196-4_19,1945144656,,0,001-230-126-359-300; 006-611-076-501-970; 013-735-898-550-999; 014-425-368-123-634; 014-818-480-999-908; 017-345-869-815-558; 017-349-318-774-487; 017-884-355-820-221; 018-524-907-721-692; 021-820-406-550-631; 024-403-212-152-856; 025-613-238-279-363; 030-217-575-405-566; 032-836-690-501-575; 048-587-117-313-594; 049-893-004-622-739; 051-978-330-522-842; 057-545-918-303-995; 058-029-140-081-708; 072-243-912-426-29X; 083-937-909-549-796; 085-169-510-383-214; 086-543-105-761-975; 094-288-127-563-800; 121-248-185-289-513; 130-532-045-006-563; 134-021-889-126-929; 155-551-193-026-890; 156-415-541-949-588; 169-004-007-623-620; 177-983-017-091-949; 184-653-311-636-497; 198-122-408-150-421,51,,(magid) 1945144656; (doi) 10.1007/978-3-642-23196-4_19,en

Ostermann; Laura Spinsanti; Werner Kuhn,"Although the integration of sensor-based information into analysis and decision making has been a research topic for many years, semantic interoperability has not yet been reached. The advent of user-generated content for the geospatial domain, Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI), makes it even more difficult to establish semantic integration. This paper proposes a novel approach to integrating conventional sensor information and VGI, which is exploited in the context of detecting forest fires. In contrast to common logic-based semantic descriptions, we present a formal system using algebraic specifications to unambiguously describe the processing steps from natural phenomena to value-added information. A generic ontology of observations is extended and profiled for forest fire detection in order to illustrate how the sensing process, and transformations between heterogeneous sensing systems, can be represented as mathematical functions and grouped into abstract data types. We discuss the required ontological commitments and a possible generalization.",4,3,807,829,Semantic integration; Abstract data type; Semantic interoperability; Ontology-based data integration; Information retrieval; Ontology; Computer science; Semantic computing; Volunteered geographic information; Geospatial analysis,,,,,https://research.utwente.nl/en/publications/semantic-observation-integration https://doi.org/10.3390/fi4030807 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/fi/fi4.html#SchadeOSK12 http://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC73717 https://www.mdpi.com/1999-5903/4/3/807/pdf https://www.mdpi.com/1999-5903/4/3/807,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fi4030807,10.3390/fi4030807,2000655505,,0,001-992-774-630-286; 005-374-785-075-748; 013-844-499-418-07X; 015-217-636-182-981; 016-043-506-725-203; 017-804-578-295-96X; 023-036-742-444-209; 024-848-286-367-819; 030-956-330-410-016; 032-903-495-847-439; 041-037-889-916-108; 043-577-672-938-47X; 050-400-163-822-153; 056-382-484-741-807; 068-930-003-699-346; 073-536-571-794-97X; 077-448-602-928-279; 078-460-486-926-118; 089-527-493-942-792; 095-068-586-489-015; 104-591-128-843-065; 106-275-177-954-00X; 107-088-642-587-78X; 111-163-933-663-414; 116-005-314-582-189; 124-168-903-289-593; 129-190-284-311-706; 136-870-363-919-712; 152-079-406-840-605; 153-940-799-073-233; 160-432-465-178-441; 163-448-497-410-351; 185-701-246-919-65X; 191-566-137-424-453; 191-807-648-603-984,11,,(magid) 2000655505; (doi) 10.3390/fi4030807; (coreid) 38624873,en

Research mostly focuses either on the data themselves while ignoring the social processes behind, or solely discusses the community-driven process without making sense of the data at a larger scale. A holistic understanding that takes these and other aspects into account is, however, seldom gained. This article describes a server infrastructure to collect and process data about different aspects of OpenStreetMap. The resulting data are offered publicly in a common container format, which fosters the simultaneous examination of different aspects with the aim of gaining a more holistic view and facilitates the results’ reproducibility. As an example of such uses, we discuss the project OSMvis. This project offers a number of visualizations, which use the datasets produced by the server infrastructure to explore and visually analyse different aspects of OpenStreetMap.

Using this available folksonomy in VGI services we propose a logical approach to highlight and possibly discover the characteristics of geographic places. The approach is based on the notion of spatial coverage and a model of tags categorization and on their semantic identification, using semantic services such as GeoNames, OpenStreetMap or WordNet. We illustrate our model with Flickr to retrieve the characteristics (function, usage?) of places even if those places have a small number of related photos. Those found characteristics allow tag disambiguation and can be use to complete the semantic gap on places and POIs such as the function of buildings, which can exist in geographic services",,,657,660,Geographic coordinate system; World Wide Web; WordNet; Information retrieval; Folksonomy; Computer science; Volunteered geographic information; Crowdsourcing; Semantic gap; Metadata; Categorization,,,,,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2872518.2890483 https://archive-ouverte.unige.ch/unige:83281/ATTACHMENT01 https://core.ac.uk/display/60981686 https://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2872518.2890483 https://archive-ouverte.unige.ch/unige:83281 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/www/www2016c.html#TardyMF16,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2872518.2890483,10.1145/2872518.2890483,2337470053,,0,014-595-250-557-455; 018-921-692-131-597; 019-758-033-385-103; 031-823-223-028-011; 036-670-900-801-09X; 039-538-974-616-760; 044-174-287-934-720; 047-391-702-837-697; 047-996-742-968-538; 049-430-126-005-48X; 052-959-680-697-143; 068-905-784-999-194; 095-559-536-377-273; 117-020-910-971-510; 134-359-742-244-38X; 138-686-570-651-782; 146-821-379-234-787; 157-383-142-605-799,2,,(magid) 2337470053; (coreid) 60981686; (doi) 10.1145/2872518.2890483,en

The gene pool and spatial configuration of human groups in this territory have been outlined throughout three historical stages: the Native pre-Hispanic world, Spanish colonization, and XIX century migrations. This research was designed with the goal of characterizing the diversity and distribution pattern of Y-chromosome lineages that are currently present in the Tolima and Huila departments (middle Magdalena River region). Historic cartography was used to identify the main geographic sites where the paternal lineages belonging to this area have gathered. Twelve municipalities were chosen, and a survey that included genealogical information was administered. Samples collected from 83 male volunteers were analyzed for 48 Y-SNPs and 17 Y-STRs. The results showed a highly diverse region characterized by the presence of 16 sublineages within the major clades R, Q, J, G, T and E and revealed that 93% (n = 77) of haplotypes were different. Among these haplogroups, European-specific R1b-M269 lineages were the most representative (57.83%), with six different subhaplogroups and 43 unique haplotypes. Native American paternal ancestry was also detected based on the presence of the Q1a2-M3*(xM19, M194, M199) and Q1a2-M346*(xM3) lineages. Interestingly, all Q1a2-M346*(xM3) samples (n = 7, with five different haplotypes) carried allele six at the DYS391 locus.

Typically, high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) or dense LiDAR point clouds are used to generate these building models. However, high-resolution LiDAR data are usually not available with extensive coverage, whereas globally available DEM data are often not detailed and accurate enough to provide sufficient input to the modeling of individual buildings. Therefore, this paper investigates the possibility of generating LOD1 building models from both volunteered geographic information (VGI) in the form of OpenStreetMap data and remote sensing-derived geodata improved by multi-sensor and multi-modal DEM fusion techniques or produced by synthetic aperture radar (SAR)-optical stereogrammetry. The results of this study show several things: First, it can be seen that the height information resulting from data fusion is of higher quality than the original data sources. Secondly, the study confirms that simple, prismatic building models can be reconstructed by combining OpenStreetMap building footprints and easily accessible, remote sensing-derived geodata, indicating the potential of application on extensive areas. The building models were created under the assumption of flat terrain at a constant height, which is valid in the selected study area.",8,4,193,,Point cloud; Terrain; Digital elevation model; CityGML; Building model; Sensor fusion; Computer science; Volunteered geographic information; Remote sensing; Synthetic aperture radar,,,,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; National Council for Eurasian and East European Research; Helmholtz-Gemeinschaft,https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/8/4/193/pdf https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019IJGI....8..193B/abstract https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi8040193 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ijgi/ijgi8.html#BagheriSZ19 https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/8/4/193,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi8040193,10.3390/ijgi8040193,2937716091,,0,001-109-699-924-050; 001-121-648-571-162; 002-439-908-421-774; 007-683-026-346-22X; 012-463-427-837-974; 014-216-260-626-888; 014-975-558-335-810; 015-321-680-169-688; 023-863-561-824-121; 029-994-843-045-589; 033-626-844-682-323; 034-311-211-670-277; 034-751-122-948-926; 036-871-559-282-943; 038-460-559-487-793; 048-532-824-699-221; 059-797-643-775-558; 070-414-170-105-585; 075-186-419-566-847; 089-836-193-502-735; 097-948-957-646-103; 140-736-059-185-256; 189-454-691-309-198,4,,(doi) 10.3390/ijgi8040193; (magid) 2937716091,en

In the past years Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) has emerged as a novel form of user-generated content, which involves active generation of geo-data for example in citizen science projects or during crisis mapping as well as the passive collection of data via the user’s location-enabled mobile devices. In addition there are more and more sensors available that detect our environment with ever greater detail and dynamics. These data can be used for a variety of applications, not only for the solution of societal tasks such as in environment, health or transport fields, but also for the development of commercial products and services. The interpretation, visualisation and usage of such multi-source data is challenging because of the large heterogeneity, the differences in quality, the high update frequencies, the varying spatial-temporal resolution, subjective characteristics and low semantic structuring. Therefore the German Research Foundation has launched a priority programme for the next 3–6 years which will support interdisciplinary research projects. This priority programme aims to provide a scientific basis for raising the potential of VGI- and sensor data. Research questions described more in detail in this short paper span from the extraction of spatial information, to the visual analysis and knowledge presentation, taking into account the social context while collecting and using VGI.",1,,15,5,Visual communication; Spatial analysis; Mobile device; Citizen science; Data science; Structuring; Visualization; Computer science; Volunteered geographic information; Social computing,,,,,https://www.proc-int-cartogr-assoc.net/1/15/2018/ica-proc-1-15-2018.pdf http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018PrICA...1...15B/abstract https://www.proc-int-cartogr-assoc.net/1/15/2018/ https://noa.gwlb.de/receive/cop_mods_00006054,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/ica-proc-1-15-2018,10.5194/ica-proc-1-15-2018,2804978872,,0,,2,,(magid) 2804978872; (doi) 10.5194/ica-proc-1-15-2018,en

Teymurian; Ali Asghar Alesheikh; Abbas Alimohammadi; Abolghasem Sadeghi-Niaraki,"Abstract. Recent advances in information technology have made geographic information system (GIS) a powerful and affordable tool for planning and decision making in various fields such as the public transportation. These technologies such as the social network (e.g. face-book, twitter), new technologies such as ubiquitous, mobile, Web 2.0, geo tagging and RFID can help to create better shapes and forms of the communication and geo-collaboration for public. By using these, user-generated content and spatial information can be easily and quickly produced and shared in a dynamic, interactive, multimedia and distributed environment. The concept of volunteered geographic information (VGI) has been introduced by the transaction from consultation to content interaction. VGI describes any type of content that has a geographic element and has been voluntarily collected. In other words, ordinary users; without a professional training, can participate in generating and using the spatial information. As a result, the gaps between the producers and users of GIS and spatial information, has been considerably reduced. Public transportation is one of the most important elements of the transportation system. Rapid growth of the cities has resulted in high increase of demand for the public transportation which created new challenges. Improvement of the desirability of public transportation can increase its efficiency, reduction of the environmental pollution (such as air and noise pollution), traffic problems, and fuel consumption. Hence, development of an urban public transportation system which is responsive to citizen's need and motivates them to use public transportation system is one of the most important objectives and issues that urban planners and designers are concerned about. One solution to achieve this, goal is to develop public transportation system by assistance from the system users. According to approach, users are considered as the valuable resources, because people who are in constant contact with the system can have detailed and updated information about the problems, solutions and they are affected by the related implemented policies. Thus user involvement is an essential part in public transport decision making process. Although GIS in transportation (GIS-T) has been used for data collection, spatial analysis, and spatial modeling, due to recent promotions, GIS-T is moving towards the use of capabilities of VGI to user-centric services. The main goals of this paper are two as follows: First is to survey and review the key concepts of the geo-collaboration, to introduce and present fields to utilizing the VGI in the public transportation system to improve the performance of that system. The Second goal is to propose a VGI-based public transport conceptual framework. in this paper in the first part capabilities of VGI is explored, and areas of public transport that can utilize the public involvement is assessed and classified. Then, by surveying the related works in this context, a classification based on the models of participation is provided. Finally, a VGI-based conceptual framework for organizing a public participation for performance measurement of urban public transport for Tehran city is proposed. Results of this paper show that utilizing VGI presents an efficient solution for public transport problems.",XL-1/W3,,425,430,GIS and public health; Information technology; Engineering; Conceptual framework; Transport engineering; Public participation; Environmental pollution; Geographic information system; Public transport; Volunteered geographic information,,,,,http://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/XL-1-W3/425/2013/isprsarchives-XL-1-W3-425-2013.pdf http://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/XL-1-W3/425/2013/ http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ISPAr.XL1c.425T/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/isprsarchives-xl-1-w3-425-2013,10.5194/isprsarchives-xl-1-w3-425-2013,2019052053,,0,000-023-169-498-61X; 010-646-838-522-132; 017-194-800-561-718; 017-695-753-475-803; 027-769-450-806-363; 031-302-647-555-751; 032-903-495-847-439; 040-555-759-889-280; 078-185-699-178-201; 081-161-722-744-630; 086-038-890-333-134; 123-555-479-678-146; 139-269-958-006-148; 145-938-203-040-981; 153-544-055-666-12X; 180-332-184-017-93X; 195-019-623-135-107; 195-305-395-054-07X; 195-407-967-678-724,2,,(magid) 2019052053; (doi) 10.5194/isprsarchives-xl-1-w3-425-2013; (coreid) 44492576,en

Jacquet; Chioma C.; Mary P. Chang; Jamil D. Bayram,"INTRODUCTION: Volunteers and members of relief organizations increasingly seek formal training prior to international field deployment. This paper identifies training programs for personnel responding to international disasters and complex humanitarian emergencies, and provides concise information - if available- regarding the founding organization, year established, location, cost, duration of training, participants targeted, and the content of each program. METHODS: An environmental scan was conducted through a combination of a peer-reviewed literature search and an open Internet search for the training programs. Literature search engines included EMBASE, Cochrane, Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science databases using the search terms ""international,"" ""disaster,"" ""complex humanitarian emergencies,"" ""training,"" and ""humanitarian response"". Both searches were conducted between January 2, 2013 and September 12, 2013. RESULTS: 14 peer-reviewed articles mentioned or described eight training programs, while open Internet search revealed 13 additional programs. In total, twenty-one training programs were identified as currently available for responders to international disasters and CHE. Each of the programs identified has different goals and objectives, duration, expenses, targeted trainees and modules. Each of the programs identified has different goals and objectives, duration, expenses, targeted trainees and modules. Seven programs (33%) are free of charge and four programs (19%) focus on the mental aspects of disasters. The mean duration for each training program is 5 to 7 days. Fourteen of the trainings are conducted in multiple locations (66%), two in Cuba (9%) and two in Australia (9%). The cost-reported in US dollars- ranges from $100 to $2,400 with a mean cost of $480 and a median cost of $135. Most of the programs are open to the public, but some are only available by invitation only, such as the International Mobilization Preparation for Action (IMPACT) and the United Nations Humanitarian Civil-Military Coordination (UN-CMCoord) Field Course. CONCLUSIONS: A variety of training programs are available for responders to disasters and complex humanitarian emergencies. These programs vary in their objectives, audiences, modules, geographical locations, eligibility and financial cost. This paper presents an overview of available programs and serves as a resource for potential responders interested in capacity-building training prior to deployment.

033-060-255-933-913,Deconstructing the binaries of spatial data production: Towards hybridity,2014-08-26,2014,journal article,The Canadian Geographer / Le Géographe canadien,00083658; 15410064,Wiley,United Kingdom,Jonathan Cinnamon,"Binaries, the most reductive form of categorization, can be usefully invoked to characterize emerging phenomena; yet, they are widely critiqued for oversimplifying a complex world and for their use as tools of social and political influence. Through a literature review and content analysis this article traces the emergence of volunteered geographic information (VGI), and identifies the recurrent use of several related binaries to contrast this phenomenon with the conventional spatial data production activities of states and corporations. Using several key examples, these binaries are deconstructed by identifying a mismatch in how VGI is conceptualized (bottom-up, amateur, asserted) in the literature and the reality of existing VGI projects. As an alternative to a binary conceptualization of spatial data production, a different representation is put forward that more accurately depicts what is in actuality a vast, shifting, and heterogeneous landscape of spatial data production approaches. Thinking about contemporary spatial data production not as a binary but as a continuum could encourage the development of hybridities that harness the benefits of different approaches—including the oversight and quality control of conventional methods, with the speed, low cost, and distributed nature of citizen-based spatial data production.; ; ; ; Deconstruire les valeurs binaires de la production de donnees spatiales: vers l'hybridite; Resume; ; Les nombres binaires, l'expression la plus simple de la categorisation, sont utiles pour caracteriser les phenomenes emergents ; pourtant, ils font l'objet de nombreuses critiques liees a leur conception simpliste du monde et a leur emploi comme moyen d'exercer une influence sociale et politique. Partant d'une recension des ecrits et d'une analyse de contenu, cet article retrace les origines de l'information geographique volontaire (IGV) et documente l'usage repete de plusieurs binaires semblables afin de mettre en opposition ce phenomene et les activites de production de donnees spatiales conventionnelles menees par des etats et des entreprises. A l'aide de plusieurs exemples probants, une deconstruction de ces binaires est operee en s'interrogeant sur le decalage entre la facon par laquelle l'IGV est conceptualisee dans la litterature (ascendante, amateur, affirmee) et les projets reels d'IGV. Une representation differente est proposee comme solution de rechange au concept bivalent de la production de donnees spatiales permettant de dresser un portrait plus precis de ce qui est en fait un paysage vaste, changeant et heterogene de modes de production de donnees spatiales. Envisager la production actuelle de donnees spatiales comme un continuum pourrait contribuer a l'emergence de formes hybrides qui tirent parti des differents modes, y compris la surveillance et le controle de la qualite propres aux methodes classiques, alliant la vitesse, le faible cout, et la distribution qui caracterisent la production citoyenne de donnees spatiales.",59,1,35,51,Humanities; Spatial analysis; Geography; Hybridity; Volunteered geographic information; Cartography,,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/handle/10871/16585 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cag.12119/full https://core.ac.uk/display/43094429,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cag.12119,10.1111/cag.12119,1575607941,,0,006-326-758-063-215; 006-630-937-571-991; 007-857-101-229-718; 008-655-662-451-459; 009-428-944-003-466; 013-803-494-618-557; 015-053-635-104-959; 016-351-820-160-022; 017-194-800-561-718; 020-749-054-636-988; 021-013-471-932-58X; 021-019-428-962-65X; 021-126-593-543-997; 023-351-967-000-166; 024-385-128-103-879; 028-415-291-488-692; 028-721-179-296-290; 030-331-558-007-119; 031-153-380-550-41X; 032-903-495-847-439; 032-957-523-378-339; 033-060-042-560-682; 034-296-402-405-270; 038-976-596-179-447; 040-136-840-595-371; 040-267-517-107-219; 043-094-641-466-186; 046-509-496-371-690; 047-100-212-874-054; 047-114-118-000-227; 049-641-424-372-181; 050-053-178-625-394; 050-809-137-344-219; 051-672-609-357-192; 052-805-326-187-771; 055-003-936-088-329; 055-536-295-769-811; 055-866-616-855-529; 056-955-969-822-504; 057-252-868-716-011; 057-460-271-254-631; 057-545-918-303-995; 060-566-519-898-822; 063-202-606-990-370; 063-231-503-055-665; 063-599-343-217-316; 074-845-352-838-528; 077-396-822-656-234; 079-150-284-796-055; 082-709-585-604-144; 083-254-133-621-603; 084-210-734-414-337; 085-276-654-810-864; 087-450-915-611-331; 087-652-291-860-625; 088-339-711-439-200; 089-694-446-714-832; 092-354-106-616-715; 093-817-122-662-126; 099-465-366-174-657; 100-866-038-545-202; 100-998-718-146-330; 101-730-056-244-941; 102-160-469-693-977; 102-515-255-327-189; 103-859-285-040-344; 106-209-907-666-435; 107-329-950-143-237; 107-809-776-769-180; 118-566-111-512-984; 118-667-574-084-819; 120-056-664-756-227; 122-151-014-222-395; 124-058-372-643-823; 125-991-260-683-438; 127-708-667-358-297; 135-360-535-210-851; 136-570-589-999-562; 137-746-440-183-269; 138-673-529-421-480; 141-214-330-148-611; 142-867-773-436-799; 147-539-342-970-008; 147-826-896-424-422; 148-040-832-068-635; 148-618-502-726-867; 152-929-987-512-578; 153-244-244-790-424; 155-245-952-776-532; 157-720-687-305-037; 158-847-532-778-731; 166-717-292-919-682; 168-321-638-734-354; 169-786-451-133-977; 171-544-875-588-246; 195-019-623-135-107,9,,(doi) 10.1111/cag.12119; (coreid) 43094429; (magid) 1575607941,en

Gething,"The primary aim of this review was to evaluate the state of knowledge of the geographical distribution of all infectious diseases of clinical significance to humans. A systematic review was conducted to enumerate cartographic progress, with respect to the data available for mapping and the methods currently applied. The results helped define the minimum information requirements for mapping infectious disease occurrence, and a quantitative framework for assessing the mapping opportunities for all infectious diseases. This revealed that of 355 infectious diseases identified, 174 (49%) have a strong rationale for mapping and of these only 7 (4%) had been comprehensively mapped. A variety of ambitions, such as the quantification of the global burden of infectious disease, international biosurveillance, assessing the likelihood of infectious disease outbreaks and exploring the propensity for infectious disease evolution and emergence, are limited by these omissions. An overview of the factors hindering progress in disease cartography is provided. It is argued that rapid improvement in the landscape of infectious diseases mapping can be made by embracing non-conventional data sources, automation of geo-positioning and mapping procedures enabled by machine learning and information technology, respectively, in addition to harnessing labour of the volunteer 'cognitive surplus' through crowdsourcing.",368,1614,20120250,20120250,Outbreak; Information technology; Public health; Geography; Data science; Disease; MEDLINE; Geographic Mapping; Infectious disease (medical specialty); Bioinformatics; Crowdsourcing,,Biosurveillance/methods; Communicable Diseases/epidemiology; Computational Biology/methods; Crowdsourcing/methods; Geographic Mapping; Global Health/statistics & numerical data; Humans,,Wellcome Trust (095066) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MR/K00669X/1) United Kingdom,https://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/368/1614/20120250/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23382431 https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2012.0250 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23382431/ https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk/publications/384207 https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/11708681 https://paperity.org/p/48674872/global-mapping-of-infectious-disease http://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/11708681/3679597.pdf?sequence=1 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/23382431,http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2012.0250,10.1098/rstb.2012.0250,2167831135,PMC3679597,0,000-412-221-309-054; 001-455-697-600-329; 001-727-916-458-235; 001-843-888-137-378; 001-873-286-777-359; 003-796-642-283-950; 003-860-975-044-185; 004-483-621-565-261; 008-825-106-579-151; 009-058-225-509-713; 009-723-435-843-397; 010-087-833-130-895; 010-569-351-591-711; 010-856-391-377-682; 011-619-707-570-997; 013-096-323-741-948; 014-640-078-260-51X; 015-143-165-400-903; 015-587-858-289-395; 015-731-903-065-547; 015-826-745-723-509; 016-025-054-963-569; 016-476-333-089-627; 016-962-356-267-530; 018-616-143-555-134; 019-164-981-417-39X; 019-385-365-609-725; 020-491-174-045-95X; 020-732-585-852-689; 022-089-871-465-295; 023-445-516-113-273; 024-214-804-060-32X; 025-136-848-812-955; 026-922-943-155-53X; 027-048-264-811-361; 027-658-273-109-054; 031-799-367-378-099; 031-946-741-053-276; 032-065-754-496-97X; 035-301-329-271-121; 036-340-091-490-882; 036-447-441-855-918; 037-236-584-905-51X; 037-276-581-955-024; 037-869-720-637-530; 037-921-916-759-56X; 039-343-259-048-864; 039-575-666-245-294; 039-626-282-406-623; 040-528-595-566-923; 041-366-516-191-99X; 043-324-332-090-26X; 044-056-610-413-080; 044-258-658-720-640; 044-345-261-905-116; 044-660-577-175-535; 047-299-107-241-416; 050-856-162-112-534; 051-275-682-667-745; 051-293-868-944-754; 051-855-287-652-173; 052-856-687-640-324; 054-719-672-814-872; 055-519-339-568-292; 058-627-818-566-996; 058-691-845-548-511; 058-890-581-607-777; 059-529-461-245-90X; 059-807-853-704-674; 060-623-327-109-647; 061-410-586-181-392; 062-749-562-683-119; 066-359-606-697-099; 067-082-359-465-561; 072-313-035-959-967; 074-765-280-905-911; 075-063-005-998-850; 076-588-701-664-350; 077-648-752-937-927; 077-861-810-615-735; 080-870-875-948-330; 081-862-147-022-712; 086-392-099-717-437; 086-685-350-382-999; 087-285-424-905-195; 088-643-024-079-449; 088-981-354-593-821; 088-985-752-085-521; 090-200-306-806-607; 090-902-007-815-155; 091-150-059-645-650; 092-876-125-944-376; 093-171-881-625-000; 098-684-039-509-759; 102-881-476-962-24X; 103-010-917-264-205; 105-154-828-117-436; 106-714-038-134-230; 111-199-902-525-435; 119-201-158-316-272; 120-827-721-750-044; 125-781-601-871-90X; 130-402-361-684-619; 131-291-179-371-605; 133-378-911-810-117; 133-429-425-335-880; 138-520-239-086-197; 140-855-399-427-778; 145-150-841-628-815; 147-119-230-627-255; 150-325-162-873-23X; 152-745-404-844-022; 174-129-134-688-718; 175-882-644-326-73X; 176-599-610-293-346; 178-509-194-861-658,138,"research support, non-u.s. gov't; research support, u.s. gov't, non-p.h.s.; review; systematic review",(pmid) 23382431; (doi) 10.1098/rstb.2012.0250; (pmcid) pmc3679597; (magid) 2167831135; (coreid) 96747784; (pii) rstb.2012.0250,en

In this context, to risk management and governance, in general, and to civil protection, specifically (termed differently in many countries, and includes, for instance: civil contingencies in the UK, homeland security in the USA, disaster risk reduction at the UN level). The main impetus of this article is to summarize key contributions and challenges in utilizing and accepting GIS and RS methods and data for disaster risk governance, which includes public bodies, but also risk managers in industry and practitioners in search and rescue organizations. The article analyzes certain method developments, such as vulnerability indicators, crowdsourcing, and emerging concepts, such as Volunteered Geographic Information, but also investigates the potential of the topic Critical Infrastructure as it could be applied on spatial assets and GIS and RS itself. Intended to stimulate research on new and emerging fields, this article’s main contribution is to move spatial research toward a more reflective stance where opportunities and challenges are equally and transparently addressed in order to gain more scientific quality. As a conclusion, GIS and RS can play a pivotal role not just in delivering data but also in connecting and analyzing data in a more integrative, holistic way.",4,4,1848,1869,GIS and public health; Geography; Risk governance; Disaster risk reduction; Critical infrastructure; Risk management; Geographic information system; Volunteered geographic information; Remote sensing; Enterprise GIS,,,,,https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01243702 https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi4041848 https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01243702/document https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/4/4/1848/htm https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015IJGI....4.1848F/abstract https://epub.ub.uni-muenchen.de/69035/index.html https://iris.unive.it/handle/10278/3667082 http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi4041848 https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/4/4/1848/pdf https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ijgi/ijgi4.html#FeketeTABGGMPSS15 https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi4041848 https://collections.unu.edu/view/UNU:3290,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi4041848,10.3390/ijgi4041848,1916896682,,0,000-267-501-004-10X; 005-132-706-907-509; 005-396-432-693-521; 005-734-526-617-289; 006-134-260-367-805; 008-655-662-451-459; 011-750-796-808-517; 014-425-368-123-634; 022-168-668-986-648; 023-884-838-352-570; 028-673-740-932-405; 029-658-228-001-151; 031-956-883-677-729; 034-769-370-145-714; 036-119-387-516-09X; 038-184-704-608-187; 044-648-833-019-004; 047-456-122-785-864; 048-084-337-077-680; 050-643-621-157-442; 051-509-627-874-329; 057-066-929-866-082; 057-545-918-303-995; 066-568-234-881-362; 066-802-149-719-275; 068-807-214-189-756; 071-810-423-178-995; 084-372-988-035-566; 092-201-781-715-103; 094-565-155-161-326; 095-519-345-235-436; 097-496-307-851-995; 103-618-152-534-300; 106-264-944-278-433; 106-445-019-129-230; 114-275-310-625-898; 115-971-869-515-441; 119-018-794-488-15X; 140-112-451-458-313; 141-777-860-661-809; 148-002-412-317-108; 158-176-788-928-823; 174-068-937-691-447; 198-122-408-150-421,21,,(magid) 1916896682; (coreid) 94859613; (doi) 10.3390/ijgi4041848,en

The purpose of this work is to provide quantitative descriptions of arterial branches, bifurcation patterns, shape, and geographical distribution of the arborization of the main cerebral arteries as well as estimations of the corresponding vascular territories. For this purpose, subject-specific digital reconstructions of the brain vascular network created from 3T magnetic resonance angiography images of healthy volunteers are used to derive population-averaged morphometric characteristics of the cerebral arterial trees.

033-918-845-284-84X,Biospecimen repositories: are blood donors willing to participate?,2010-05-07,2010,journal article,Transfusion,15372995; 00411132,Wiley-Blackwell,United Kingdom,Erik A. Scott; Karen S. Schlumpf; Sunitha Mathew; Alan E. Mast; Michael P. Busch; Jerome L. Gottschall,"A number of recent reports have described the utility of biospecimen repositories in transfusion medicine, both donor only repositories and matched donor-recipient repositories.1–5 Busch and Glynn recently editorialized on the usefulness of biospecimen repositories to blood-safety and infectious disease research alongside a study by Cannon et al. that utilized repository biospecimens to determine the transmission rate of human herpesvirus-8 through blood transfusion.6,7 Reesink and colleagues recently described the results of an international survey of repository practices, which indicated that many countries have a national policy requiring storage of biospecimens from blood donors.8 Although biospecimens are used mainly for infectious disease look-back investigations, testing new or more sensitive tests for products still in inventory, or for investigation of suspected TRALI cases, many countries also allow archived biospecimens to be used for research applications. Allain and Busch provide an extensive list of donor-only, recipient-only and linked donor-recipient repositories and cite over 200 original articles that use these repositories, emphasizing the high utility of biospecimen repositories.9; ; In the United States, there is no policy requiring storage of routine biospecimens from blood donors. Existing donor biospecimen repositories have been created through multi-center collaborative efforts such as the Transfusion-Transmitted Viruses Study, the Transfusion Safety Study, and the Retrovirus Epidemiology Donor Studies (REDS-I and II). The REDS-I group created four large repositories: the General Serum Repository (GSR), the General Leukocyte and Plasma Repository (GLPR), the REDS Allogeneic Donor and Recipient Repository (RADAR) and the HTLV Outcomes Study (HOST) repository, formerly known as the REDS HTLV Cohort.9 In most cases institutional review boards require that consent be obtained from participants before biospecimens are stored in repositories and allow patients/donors to refuse to participate. A potential limitation of volunteer-based biospecimen repositories is the representativeness of the participants to the population at large. More specifically, the well-documented limited participation of minorities in medical research studies may lead to under representation of some groups in studies performed using biospecimens obtained through volunteer repositories.10–12; ; In 1998, REDS-I conducted a comprehensive mail survey of volunteer allogeneic donors. The survey was designed to measure donor demographics and donation patterns as well as attitudes regarding a diverse range of topics, such as motivation to donate, blood donation incentives, knowledge of infectious disease screening and transmission and unreported deferrable risks, and the influence of computer assisted self-interviewing on the likelihood of disclosing sensitive information during donor screening.13–17 In addition to those and other topics, five questions designed to determine donor opinion regarding storage of residual biospecimens from blood donations as well as potential uses of those biospecimens were included in the survey.; ; As part of the second REDS (REDS-II) program, the Leukocyte Antibody Prevalence Study (LAPS), which was designed to determine the prevalence and characteristics of antibodies to human leukocyte antigens (HLA) in the allogeneic donor population of the United States, included a secondary objective to create a repository of plasma and DNA biospecimens collected from well-characterized donor-subjects who were also willing to allow residual biospecimens to be preserved and used for future transfusion medicine research. The rationale, design and implementation of LAPS has previously been described.18,19; ; The impetus for this analysis arose from an anecdotal observation by recruitment staff that minority donors, though willing to participate in the antibody screening arm of the LAPS protocol, were less likely to agree to also participate in the LAPS repository. This report describes subject participation rates in the LAPS biospecimen repository by race/ethnicity and other demographic parameters (e.g., gender, geographic region) and then compares them to donor opinions regarding the collection, storage and use of biospecimens for research collected through the 1998 REDS-I survey.",50,9,1943,1950,Epidemiology; Immunology; Donation; Population; Biospecimen; Blood donor; Antibody prevalence; Family medicine; Infectious disease (medical specialty); Medicine; Transfusion medicine,,Adult; African Americans; Aged; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Blood Donors/psychology; Blood Preservation/psychology; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Hispanic Americans; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Young Adult,,PHS HHS (HHSN268200517181C) United States; NHLBI NIH HHS (N01-HB-47175) United States; PHS HHS (HHSN268200417175C) United States; NHLBI NIH HHS (N01-HB-47174) United States; NHLBI NIH HHS (N01-HB-47168) United States; NHLBI NIH HHS (N01-HB-57181) United States; NHLBI NIH HHS (N01HB47168) United States; NHLBI NIH HHS (HHSN268200517181C) United States; NHLBI NIH HHS (HHSN268200417175C) United States,http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC2990341 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2990341/ https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1537-2995.2010.02667.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1537-2995.2010.02667.x,10.1111/j.1537-2995.2010.02667.x,1864873639,PMC2990341,0,003-687-307-165-786; 007-414-779-706-028; 007-665-258-317-832; 010-121-588-805-524; 011-881-865-715-550; 016-239-174-018-872; 016-370-714-077-528; 022-461-240-473-668; 024-149-023-643-102; 026-172-416-950-195; 026-380-874-279-972; 028-042-717-281-180; 031-212-744-690-104; 031-989-579-945-769; 033-028-632-728-908; 035-060-024-593-125; 038-294-776-510-370; 048-715-949-942-768; 052-083-271-586-086; 057-880-426-690-691; 057-919-089-643-215; 080-421-773-082-587; 084-281-741-729-773; 084-427-781-406-214,27,"research support, n.i.h., extramural",(pmcid) pmc2990341; (pmid) 20456705; (pii) trf2667; (doi) 10.1111/j.1537-2995.2010.02667.x; (magid) 1864873639,en

In this study, we investigate using OpenStreetMap data to integrate indoor and outdoor route planning for pedestrians. To support indoor and outdoor route planning, in this paper, we focus on the connections inside buildings and propose a data model, which uses OSM primitives (nodes, ways and relations) and tags to capture horizontal and vertical indoor components, as well as the connection between indoor and outdoor environments. A set of new approaches is developed to support indoor modeling and mapping. Based on the proposed data model, we present a workflow that enables automatic generation of a routing graph and provide an algorithm to calculate integrated indoor-outdoor routes. We applied our data model to a set of test cases. The application results demonstrate the capability of our data model in modeling built environments and its feasibility for the integration of indoor and outdoor navigation.",18,7,2100,,Data mining; Test case; Graph; Workflow; Route planning; Computer science; Volunteered geographic information; Horizontal and vertical; Data model,OpenStreetMap; indoor; outdoor; route planning,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/sensors/sensors18.html#WangN18 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6068512 https://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/381259 https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Adspace.library.uu.nl%3A1874%2F381259,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s18072100,10.3390/s18072100,2810456982,PMC6068512,0,006-705-913-521-168; 012-116-474-567-851; 015-321-680-169-688; 017-731-375-553-661; 030-416-570-557-01X; 034-769-370-145-714; 056-763-602-937-819; 057-545-918-303-995; 064-629-671-367-701; 082-366-214-673-579; 093-007-570-079-351; 102-160-469-693-977; 106-124-837-811-883; 117-421-082-753-08X; 132-246-550-138-466; 144-181-346-432-896; 171-216-372-434-859,8,,(pii) s18072100; (pmid) 29966340; (pmcid) pmc6068512; (doi) 10.3390/s18072100; (magid) 2810456982,en

M. M. Saldana-Perez; M. Moreno-Ibarra; M. Tores-Ruiz,"Abstract. The Volunteer Geographic Information (VGI) can be used to understand the urban dynamics. In the classification of traffic related short texts to analyze road problems in urban areas, a VGI data analysis is done over a social media’s publications, in order to classify traffic events at big cities that modify the movement of vehicles and people through the roads, such as car accidents, traffic and closures. The classification of traffic events described in short texts is done by applying a supervised machine learning algorithm. In the approach users are considered as sensors which describe their surroundings and provide their geographic position at the social network. The posts are treated by a text mining process and classified into five groups. Finally, the classified events are grouped in a data corpus and geo-visualized in the study area, to detect the places with more vehicular problems.",XLII-4/W3,,91,97,Geography; Data science; Social media; Volunteered geographic information; Social network,,,,,https://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/XLII-4-W3/91/2017/ https://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/XLII-4-W3/91/2017/isprs-archives-XLII-4-W3-91-2017.pdf https://noa.gwlb.de/receive/cop_mods_00008622 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ISPAr42W3...91S/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-xlii-4-w3-91-2017,10.5194/isprs-archives-xlii-4-w3-91-2017,2757091165,,0,,1,,(coreid) 87751628; (doi) 10.5194/isprs-archives-xlii-4-w3-91-2017; (magid) 2757091165,en

In January 2013 OSM gained its one millionth registered member. Several studies have shown that only a small percentage of these registered members carry out the large majority of the mapping and map editing work. In this article we discuss results from a social-network based analysis of seven major cities in OSM in an effort to understand if there is quantitative evidence of interaction and collaboration between OSM members in these areas. Are OSM contributors working on their own to build OSM databases in these cities or is there evidence of collaboration between OSM contributors? We find that in many cases high frequent contributors (“senior mappers”) perform very large amounts of mapping work on their own but do interact (edit/update) contributions from lower frequency contributors.,18,5,633,659,Human–computer interaction; The Internet; World Wide Web; Geography; Millionth; Qualitative evidence; Volunteered geographic information,,,,,https://www.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/tgis.12051 https://doi.org/10.1111/tgis.12051 http://www.cs.nuim.ie/~pmooney/websitePapers/TGIS_June2013_MooneyCorcoran.pdf http://orca.cf.ac.uk/89566/ https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tgis.12051/abstract https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/tgis/tgis18.html#MooneyC14 https://core.ac.uk/display/103581185,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tgis.12051,10.1111/tgis.12051,1873932332,,0,000-819-701-561-026; 001-706-105-558-15X; 008-714-358-699-609; 014-425-368-123-634; 021-041-484-242-674; 022-473-450-579-960; 023-284-720-663-016; 023-944-610-447-065; 026-645-756-189-301; 027-574-589-658-991; 027-736-997-184-595; 029-965-425-507-24X; 030-261-141-295-070; 035-161-913-145-763; 035-584-938-821-726; 046-748-518-892-808; 047-100-212-874-054; 050-761-862-900-919; 054-941-787-662-255; 060-955-315-523-841; 063-226-835-335-552; 075-869-838-337-064; 079-356-630-177-024; 084-998-354-024-835; 086-329-388-138-19X; 088-465-320-539-009; 088-792-943-887-374; 098-565-405-790-308; 105-213-938-893-054; 106-422-237-181-326; 129-909-646-150-845; 133-439-587-267-381; 144-429-196-088-386; 147-876-713-700-216; 161-366-624-528-677; 164-241-021-060-446; 164-852-447-232-420; 166-717-292-919-682; 198-122-408-150-421,52,,(doi) 10.1111/tgis.12051; (coreid) 32598197; (magid) 1873932332,en

035-722-979-649-865,Assessing geographic controls of hair isotopic variability in human populations: A case-study in Canada.,2020-08-10,2020,journal article,PloS one,19326203,Public Library of Science,United States,Clement P. Bataille; Michelle M. G. Chartrand; Francis Raposo; Gilles St-Jean,"Studying the isotope variability in fast-growing human tissues (e.g., hair, nails) is a powerful tool to investigate human nutrition. However, interpreting the controls of this isotopic variability at the population scale is often challenging as multiple factors can superimpose on the isotopic signals of a current population. Here, we analyse carbon, nitrogen, and sulphur isotopes in hair from 590 Canadian resident volunteers along with demographics, dietary and geographic information about each participant. We use a series of machine-learning regressions to demonstrate that the isotopic values in Canadian residents’ hair are not only influenced by dietary choices but by geographic controls. First, we show that isotopic values in Canadian residents’ hair have a limited range of variability consistent with the homogenization of Canadian dietary habits (as in other industrialized countries). As expected, some of the isotopic variability within the population correlates with recorded individual dietary choices. More interestingly, some regional spatial patterns emerge from carbon and sulphur isotope variations. The high carbon isotope composition of the hair of eastern Canadians relative to that of western Canadians correlates with the dominance of corn in the eastern Canadian food-industry. The gradient of sulphur isotope composition in Canadian hair from coast to inland regions correlates with the increasing soil pH and decreasing deposition of marine-derived sulphate aerosols in local food systems. We conclude that part of the isotopic variability found in the hair of Canadian residents reflects the isotopic signature associated with specific environmental conditions and agricultural practices of regional food systems transmitted to humans through the high consumption rate of intra-provincial food in Canada. Our study also underscores the strong potential of sulphur isotopes as tracers of human and food provenance.",15,8,e0237105,,Agriculture; Isotopic signature; Spatial ecology; Ecology; Geography; Provenance; Demographics; Population; High carbon; Food systems,,"Adult; Biological Variation, Population; Canada; Carbon Isotopes/analysis; Diet/statistics & numerical data; Female; Hair/chemistry; Humans; Male; Nitrogen Isotopes/analysis; Sulfur Isotopes/analysis",Carbon Isotopes; Nitrogen Isotopes; Sulfur Isotopes,"Chemical, Biological, Radiological-Nuclear and Explosives Research and Technology Initiative; Canadian Security and Safety Program Targeted Investment",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32776947 https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0237105 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7416927,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0237105,10.1371/journal.pone.0237105,3048456364,PMC7416927,0,000-588-732-963-014; 000-923-399-549-738; 001-673-898-065-487; 003-635-483-442-266; 005-689-831-584-583; 005-690-390-214-71X; 005-804-696-509-265; 007-592-083-200-290; 008-091-809-741-784; 008-988-610-925-777; 009-124-133-729-770; 009-150-650-483-472; 010-203-326-304-139; 010-363-530-356-73X; 011-832-284-209-771; 013-244-957-188-357; 013-712-009-531-770; 015-984-388-949-633; 016-038-068-183-849; 017-829-666-882-460; 018-433-542-584-846; 020-802-309-749-344; 021-035-622-675-208; 021-501-870-024-389; 021-680-227-852-181; 021-862-874-182-986; 022-591-288-559-888; 026-077-176-860-223; 032-786-131-743-997; 041-218-956-002-350; 043-234-881-551-357; 044-126-545-961-769; 044-710-576-171-682; 046-671-492-832-07X; 046-708-317-841-506; 053-892-322-225-181; 054-867-359-461-964; 055-864-025-783-413; 057-787-903-324-55X; 060-242-559-382-133; 060-613-009-848-760; 062-537-846-551-877; 064-592-318-743-968; 064-798-061-257-991; 065-256-656-443-400; 065-276-743-174-200; 065-390-589-334-104; 067-256-005-492-367; 067-288-389-432-553; 068-703-850-094-591; 071-562-971-410-628; 076-006-971-050-049; 076-093-711-415-476; 079-738-400-172-58X; 079-928-187-320-447; 080-175-441-180-091; 081-656-761-222-709; 081-661-435-297-656; 082-376-622-785-974; 085-263-995-445-444; 089-432-650-571-744; 091-651-983-179-814; 096-747-225-554-468; 096-905-006-728-940; 098-210-053-366-286; 099-653-513-602-34X; 101-375-647-003-388; 101-755-883-235-062; 102-484-086-083-785; 104-338-757-904-677; 109-063-234-278-736; 114-623-886-737-153; 117-602-179-097-755; 118-097-409-690-450; 119-266-156-310-691; 122-124-062-325-66X; 123-498-859-171-509; 130-262-716-370-941; 131-258-396-306-549; 131-665-335-490-942; 134-551-050-254-341; 151-438-707-622-236; 164-219-119-095-259; 176-899-813-633-456; 186-813-629-368-739,3,"research support, non-u.s. gov't",(pii) pone-d-20-08053; (magid) 3048456364; (pmcid) pmc7416927; (pmid) 32776947; (doi) 10.1371/journal.pone.0237105,en

Examples are the ‘Einzelfall-Map’ or earlier maps that were designed to show refugee infrastructure but doubled for use in planning attacks on refugees. A closer inspection of these maps shows the use of simplified and generalized language, disrespect for the rule of law and human rights, and xenophobic metaphorical language. While these characteristics are used not only by right-wing movements (they can also be identified in left-wing anti-globalization discourse), right-wing movements tend to use spatial language more often than other political tendencies. This paper analyses language used by rightwing populists in maps that are based on volunteered geographic information – as for example in the ‘Einzelfall-Map’. The analysis of the contents of the map, based on the ‘syndrome approach’, presents the various discourses that circulate around the topic ‘right-wing populism’. This analysis contributes to the development of teaching strategies that unearth the explicitly geographic language used by populist ideologies.",1,,36,48,Ideology; Human rights; Refugee; Rule of law; Media studies; Social media; Populism; Volunteered geographic information; Politics,,,,,http://www.austriaca.at/rootcollection?arp=0x00373575 https://austriaca.at/0xc1aa5576_0x00373575.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1553/giscience2017_02_s36,10.1553/giscience2017_02_s36,2772099977,,0,,2,,(magid) 2772099977; (doi) 10.1553/giscience2017_02_s36; (coreid) 141568125,en

This effect has a negative impact on energy management in buildings, and also has a direct impact on human health, especially for elderly people. With the advent of volunteered geographic information from private weather station networks, more high-resolution data are now available within cities to better analyze this effect. However, such datasets are large and have heterogeneous characteristics requiring visual-interactive applications to support further analysis.

Bishop,"<jats:p>High density residential development in metropolitan Melbourne, where contradictory imperatives of neighbourhood character and urban intensification play important roles, remains an uncertain practice. One key issue for plan implementation is the lack of consistency between authorities, developers and the community in interpreting the standards, design guidelines, and state/local strategies, especially those relating to neighbourhood character. There is currently no mechanism to incorporate community perceptions and place experiences as subjective aspects of neighbourhood character in development assessments. There is also little use of micro-scale and multi-dimensional spatial analysis to integrate these subjective aspects with objective measures (e.g. building volume and height; streetscape) to communicate effectively—and in a limited timeframe—with all stakeholders. This paper explores the potential of two emerging geospatial technologies that can be leveraged to respond to these problems. Evidence in the literature suggests that volunteered geographic information (VGI) can provide community input around subjective aspects of the urban environment. In addition, a deluge of three-dimensional (3D) spatial information (e.g. 3D city models) is increasingly available for micro-level (building- or property-level) assessment of the physical aspects of the urban environment. This paper formulates and discusses a conceptual framework to link these two spatial technological advancements in a virtual geographic environment (VGE) that accounts for micro-scale 3D spatial analysis incorporating both subjective and objective aspects of neighbourhood character relevant in implementing compact city strategies.</jats:p>",1,2,32,48,Conceptual framework; Civil engineering; Spatial analysis; Geography; 3D city models; Compact city; Urban studies; Neighbourhood character; Volunteered geographic information; Environmental planning; Geospatial analysis,,,,,https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/scholarlywork/1278167-leveraging-vgi-integrated-with-3d-spatial-technology-to-support-urban-intensification-in-melbourne--australia https://ideas.repec.org/a/cog/urbpla/v1y2016i2p32-48.html https://www.cogitatiopress.com/urbanplanning/article/view/623/623 https://core.ac.uk/display/87756371 https://www.cogitatiopress.com/urbanplanning/article/download/623/623,http://dx.doi.org/10.17645/up.v1i2.623,10.17645/up.v1i2.623,2444002369,,0,005-509-967-132-059; 009-186-050-043-099; 014-514-418-726-674; 014-595-250-557-455; 017-504-553-574-482; 018-633-909-125-205; 021-094-272-687-89X; 025-287-102-025-718; 027-343-564-939-502; 027-514-184-277-184; 032-165-152-377-20X; 032-168-427-347-215; 033-026-404-227-010; 038-415-228-857-355; 043-149-409-618-283; 046-402-335-208-278; 046-613-509-031-346; 047-133-845-411-886; 057-545-918-303-995; 057-605-542-776-453; 058-747-196-494-41X; 062-837-296-925-153; 063-810-405-846-144; 066-361-280-389-100; 069-566-524-554-386; 069-685-552-246-796; 070-724-339-689-787; 071-758-735-865-190; 082-550-762-385-455; 087-361-730-027-994; 091-204-512-390-272; 091-809-221-301-454; 094-538-615-032-514; 094-981-136-757-610; 096-094-553-934-739; 100-044-299-094-574; 109-491-491-329-398; 112-192-248-965-78X; 117-900-767-404-155; 117-963-668-495-643; 120-901-599-238-233; 121-452-462-497-467; 129-367-558-184-443; 134-610-492-402-257; 143-980-095-626-972; 144-334-111-592-574; 145-053-589-804-287; 147-550-752-318-925; 150-253-635-130-816; 161-284-307-894-703; 164-637-177-519-584; 176-138-800-799-610; 183-626-905-788-850,4,,(magid) 2444002369; (doi) 10.17645/up.v1i2.623,en

To this purpose, in literature VGI data has been sometime compared with authoritative geospatial data. Evaluation of single contributions to VGI databases is more relevant for some applications and typically relies on evaluating reputation of contributors and using it as proxy measures for data quality. In this paper, we present a novel approach for reputation evaluation that is based on the well known PageRank algorithm for Web pages. We use a simple model for describing different versions of a geospatial entity in terms of corrections and completions. Authors, VGI contributions and their mutual relationships are modeled as nodes of a graph.

The data reveal fine-grained spatial and temporal patterns within and across metropolitan housing markets in the United States.

038-382-270-008-623,Benefits and Drawbacks of Citizen Science to Complement Traditional Data Gathering Approaches for Medically Important Hard Ticks (Acari: Ixodidae) in the United States,2021-01-12,2021,journal article,Journal of medical entomology,19382928; 00222585,Entomological Society of America,United States,Lars Eisen; Rebecca J. Eisen,"Tick-borne diseases are increasing in North America. Knowledge of which tick species and associated human pathogens are present locally can inform the public and medical community about the acarological risk for tick bites and tick-borne infections. Citizen science (also called community-based monitoring, volunteer monitoring, or participatory science) is emerging as a potential approach to complement traditional tick record data gathering where all aspects of the work is done by researchers or public health professionals. One key question is how citizen science can best be used to generate high-quality data to fill knowledge gaps that are difficult to address using traditional data gathering approaches. Citizen science is particularly useful to generate information on human-tick encounters and may also contribute to geographical tick records to help define species distributions across large areas. Previous citizen science projects have utilized three distinct tick record data gathering methods including submission of: 1) physical tick specimens for identification by professional entomologists, 2) digital images of ticks for identification by professional entomologists, and 3) data where the tick species and life stage were identified by the citizen scientist. We explore the benefits and drawbacks of citizen science, relative to the traditional scientific approach, to generate data on tick records, with special emphasis on data quality for species identification and tick encounter locations. We recognize the value of citizen science to tick research but caution that the generated information must be interpreted cautiously with data quality limitations firmly in mind to avoid misleading conclusions.",58,1,1,9,Data collection; Public health; Citizen science; Data quality; Data science; Ixodidae; Tick; Hard ticks; Species identification; Biology,Ixodidae; citizen science; tick data collection; tick surveillance,Animals; Citizen Science/methods; Epidemiological Monitoring; Geography; Humans; Ixodes/classification; Ixodidae/classification; Tick Infestations/transmission; Tick-Borne Diseases/transmission; United States,,,https://academic.oup.com/jme/article/58/1/1/5890085 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32772108/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32772108,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jme/tjaa165,10.1093/jme/tjaa165,3047905284,,0,000-740-941-471-466; 001-117-752-253-058; 001-512-882-968-73X; 002-047-944-928-377; 003-589-808-377-681; 004-203-410-575-049; 004-270-578-055-08X; 004-892-863-467-573; 004-964-782-304-406; 005-574-367-263-080; 005-829-830-331-017; 007-953-384-453-727; 010-619-369-216-293; 012-996-505-754-35X; 016-409-685-577-026; 017-007-239-760-378; 019-182-823-271-611; 021-561-922-742-855; 023-696-083-017-740; 024-065-651-475-885; 024-076-844-295-841; 024-999-628-816-249; 025-117-982-894-409; 025-192-492-290-194; 025-195-337-291-625; 025-417-079-766-966; 026-619-471-966-227; 027-346-539-836-468; 027-821-272-307-371; 028-131-906-883-783; 029-259-430-459-950; 030-676-045-422-812; 031-115-525-596-48X; 034-388-962-863-446; 036-343-750-878-623; 037-208-197-357-076; 037-214-986-734-197; 038-410-459-677-252; 038-645-094-165-081; 039-637-928-816-298; 039-950-624-102-617; 040-487-202-443-87X; 042-283-407-343-774; 042-461-929-287-289; 044-915-280-463-562; 045-178-066-330-565; 046-821-656-722-215; 047-016-471-818-768; 048-075-634-707-613; 048-655-502-882-250; 049-842-420-096-547; 052-025-568-825-775; 058-081-609-364-173; 058-313-070-752-163; 058-434-584-454-850; 062-783-666-582-952; 064-326-545-155-275; 065-210-999-405-023; 065-397-600-650-661; 066-117-804-651-444; 068-476-529-990-894; 070-316-594-561-550; 073-852-001-962-227; 074-670-351-815-189; 075-138-395-866-231; 076-875-655-595-420; 078-597-830-839-927; 080-003-256-504-786; 081-752-881-971-472; 081-945-404-015-569; 082-010-020-637-978; 082-605-764-083-034; 082-869-082-140-037; 083-874-974-637-527; 084-719-425-496-000; 088-676-465-604-844; 090-290-171-230-904; 092-130-056-053-316; 092-376-142-185-809; 097-500-998-966-60X; 098-474-754-460-506; 098-710-449-806-330; 104-823-949-491-335; 106-135-552-618-67X; 120-122-756-759-137; 123-123-220-164-446; 126-208-864-179-258; 126-488-516-375-737; 131-728-101-624-333; 132-090-930-543-457; 133-885-599-182-561; 145-833-886-573-494; 147-179-778-499-329; 169-625-846-875-281; 177-283-856-137-955,2,review,(pmid) 32772108; (magid) 3047905284; (pii) 5890085; (doi) 10.1093/jme/tjaa165,en

It is necessary to continually extract current road structure, as it changes rapidly with the development of the city. Due to the success of semantic segmentation based on deep learning in the application of computer vision, extracting road networks from VHR (Very High Resolution) imagery becomes a method of updating geographic databases. The major shortcoming of deep learning methods for road networks extraction is that they need a massive amount of high quality pixel-wise training datasets, which is hard to obtain. Meanwhile, a large amount of different types of VGI (volunteer geographic information) data including road centerline has been accumulated in the past few decades. However, most road centerlines in VGI data lack precise width information and, therefore, cannot be directly applied to conventional supervised deep learning models. In this paper, we propose a novel weakly supervised method to extract road networks from VHR images using only the OSM (OpenStreetMap) road centerline as training data instead of high quality pixel-wise road width label. Large amounts of paired Google Earth images and OSM data are used to validate the approach. The results show that the proposed method can extract road networks from the VHR images both accurately and effectively without using pixel-wise road training data.",8,11,478,,Deep learning; Data mining; Artificial intelligence; Road networks; City management; Very high resolution; Computer science; Training set; Volunteered geographic information; Segmentation,,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China-Yunnan Joint Fund; National Natural Science Foundation of China-Yunnan Joint Fund,https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/8/11/478/htm https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019IJGI....8..478W/abstract https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/8/11/478/pdf https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ijgi/ijgi8.html#WuDCXGJ19,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi8110478,10.3390/ijgi8110478,2981329832,,0,000-479-999-808-045; 005-592-077-144-998; 005-704-074-323-353; 009-932-115-186-579; 013-197-185-992-222; 014-294-779-021-838; 014-573-609-611-247; 023-004-782-230-276; 027-448-723-977-030; 038-976-596-179-447; 041-469-337-563-26X; 048-954-961-610-481; 054-703-143-706-239; 061-536-810-837-565; 063-390-053-777-270; 075-505-206-339-830; 088-339-711-439-200; 104-563-287-492-276; 106-264-944-278-433; 111-851-503-610-696; 137-823-146-713-923; 163-191-345-579-376,6,,(doi) 10.3390/ijgi8110478; (magid) 2981329832,en

Software maintenance is a significant part of the software life-cycle cost. Current research focuses on the maintenance of application software. Despite increased focus on systems integration, there is limited research on maintaining integrated systems. Before progressing with informing software integration practice, researchers therefore need to better understand the actual work of maintaining integrated systems.</p><p><strong>Research</strong>. To this end, a study of maintaining an integrated system in practice has been conducted. The study is conducted in the context of a community of volunteer software integrators.

The main empirical contribution offered by this thesis is insight into the social and technical processes of maintaining an integrated system in a distributed community of volunteer software integrators.

Uhl; Deborah Balk; Bryan Jones,"Global data on settlements, built-up land and population distributions are becoming increasingly available and represent important inputs to a better understanding of key demographic processes such as urbanization and interactions between human and natural systems over time. One persistent drawback that prevents user communities from effectively and objectively using these data products more broadly, is the absence of thorough and transparent validation studies. This study develops a validation framework for accuracy assessment of multi-temporal built-up land layers using integrated public parcel and building records as validation data. The framework is based on measures derived from confusion matrices and incorporates a sensitivity analysis for potential spatial offsets between validation and test data as well as tests for the effects of varying criteria of the abstract term built-up land on accuracy measures. Furthermore, the framework allows for accuracy assessments by strata of built-up density, which provides important insights on the relationship between classification accuracy and development intensity to better instruct and educate user communities on quality aspects that might be relevant to different purposes. We use data from the newly-released Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL), for four epochs since 1975 and at fine spatial resolution (38m), in the United States for a demonstration of the framework. The results show very encouraging accuracy measures that vary across study areas, generally improve over time but show very distinct patterns across the rural-urban trajectories. Areas of higher development intensity are very accurately classified and highly reliable. Rural areas show low degrees of accuracy, which could be affected by misalignment between the reference data and the data under test in areas where built-up land is scattered and rare. However, a regression analysis, which examines how well GHSL can estimate built-up land using spatially aggregated analytical units, indicates that classification error is mainly of thematic nature. Thus, caution should be taken in using the data product in rural regions. The results can be useful in further improving classification procedures to create measures of the built environment. The validation framework can be extended to data-poor regions of the world using map data and Volunteered Geographic Information.",204,,898,917,Data mining; Built environment; Regression analysis; Test data; Reference data (financial markets); Urbanization; Computer science; Volunteered geographic information; Remote sensing; Data integration; Thematic map,Accuracy assessment; Data integration; Global Human Settlement Layer; Open data; Spatiotemporal uncertainty; Urban land,,,NICHD NIH HHS (P2C HD066613) United States,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018RSEnv.204..898L/abstract https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29599568 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425717304017 https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/5831244,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2017.08.035,10.1016/j.rse.2017.08.035,2763014865,PMC5868966,0,000-306-691-818-591; 003-677-713-873-99X; 004-688-425-626-855; 008-742-143-219-493; 010-707-346-843-745; 011-675-217-913-914; 016-962-356-267-530; 018-923-819-294-430; 026-107-179-509-492; 026-813-377-082-168; 030-691-047-640-843; 033-325-697-535-251; 033-370-372-421-734; 036-814-074-208-787; 037-878-446-368-706; 042-911-245-131-123; 044-898-668-023-385; 045-201-107-411-584; 045-417-249-670-015; 045-898-162-780-73X; 049-998-992-395-383; 051-439-250-950-246; 057-524-856-897-78X; 058-568-955-147-387; 060-788-547-234-349; 063-645-389-904-941; 069-048-542-531-065; 070-789-263-716-052; 071-720-382-141-598; 072-848-087-717-792; 080-156-480-293-52X; 093-749-242-539-999; 102-568-077-616-015; 104-115-412-837-909; 110-001-582-552-289; 110-803-437-205-218; 114-315-925-743-165; 116-141-368-783-855; 116-318-352-049-358; 118-467-132-246-271; 132-492-536-863-34X; 153-649-761-207-570; 154-494-120-673-582; 179-304-543-978-73X; 192-159-219-905-611; 196-826-352-496-812,42,,(pmcid) pmc5868966; (pmid) 29599568; (magid) 2763014865; (doi) 10.1016/j.rse.2017.08.035,en

Citizen science projects have the potential to expand upon data collected by specialist researchers as they are able to gain access to previously unattainable information, consequently increasing the likelihood of an effective management program. The primary objective of this research was to develop guidelines for a successful regional-scale citizen science project following a critical analysis of 12 existing citizen science case studies. Secondly, the effectiveness of these guidelines was measured through the implementation of a citizen science project, Koala Quest, for the purpose of estimating the presence of koalas in a fragmented landscape. Consequently, this research aimed to determine whether citizen-collected data can augment traditional science research methods, by comparing and contrasting the abundance of koala sightings gathered by citizen scientists and professional researchers. Based upon the guidelines developed, Koala Quest methodologies were designed, the study conducted, and the efficacy of the project assessed. To combat the high variability of estimated koala populations due to differences in counting techniques, a national monitoring and evaluation program is required, in addition to a standardised method for conducting koala population estimates. Citizen science is a useful method for monitoring animals such as the koala, which are sparsely distributed throughout a vast geographical area, as the large numbers of volunteers recruited by a citizen science project are capable of monitoring a similarly broad spatial range.",6,7,42,,Environmental resource management; Citizen science; Geography; Urban ecosystem; Monitoring and evaluation; Population; Phascolarctos cinereus; Effective management; High variability; Animal welfare,citizen science; citizen science guidelines; koala management,,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/6/7/42/pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/90127742 https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/6/7/42 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4961998/ https://habricentral.org/resources/59636 https://research-repository.griffith.edu.au/handle/10072/100381,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani6070042,10.3390/ani6070042,2468299334,PMC4961998,0,000-845-933-317-283; 001-117-752-253-058; 002-713-603-044-110; 011-384-692-027-866; 014-542-144-278-146; 015-184-313-581-154; 024-723-379-221-772; 027-034-641-090-057; 040-734-834-983-378; 041-594-070-848-049; 041-973-163-277-054; 045-655-691-277-404; 048-718-083-038-658; 049-169-404-857-089; 050-647-960-292-057; 052-876-526-578-636; 053-511-064-174-710; 056-738-598-873-714; 076-172-774-771-027; 079-919-539-407-227; 081-235-270-322-291; 082-068-003-678-745; 084-374-719-159-703; 087-181-384-403-02X; 092-487-663-770-386; 099-564-791-910-882; 100-625-700-238-382; 119-565-314-181-785; 129-214-248-332-116; 144-428-081-225-286; 159-963-301-919-239; 173-170-629-265-037; 174-763-812-563-18X; 182-860-695-091-455; 194-026-231-531-919,2,,(pmcid) pmc4961998; (pmid) 27429008; (doi) 10.3390/ani6070042; (pii) ani6070042; (coreid) 90127742; (magid) 2468299334,en
041-017-063-144-465,Using volunteered geographical information to map the November 2012 floods in Slovenia,2013-11-05,2013,journal article,Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences,16849981; 15618633,Copernicus GmbH,Germany,M. Triglav-Čekada; D. Radovan,"<jats:p>Abstract. Volunteered geographical information represents a promising field in the monitoring and mapping of natural disasters. The contributors of volunteered geographical information have the advantage that they are at the location of the natural disaster at exactly the time when the disaster happened. Therefore, they can provide the most complete account of the extent of the damage. This is not always possible when applying photogrammetric or remote-sensing methods, as prior to the data acquisition an order to carry out the measurements has to be made. On 5 and 6 November 2012 almost half of Slovenia was badly affected by floods. The gathering of volunteered geographical information in the form of images and videos of these floods is presented. Two strategies were used: (1) a public call for volunteered contributions and (2) a web search for useful images and their authors. The authorship of these images was verified with every contributor. In total, 15 contributors provided 102 terrestrial and aerial images and one aerial video, with 45% classified as potentially useful. For actual flood mapping 22 images and 12 sequences from video were used. With the help of the volunteered images 12% of the most severely affected river sections were mapped. Altogether, 1195.3 ha of flooded areas outside of the usual river beds along a total river length of 48 km were mapped. The results are compared with those from satellite mapping of the same floods, which successfully covered 18% of the most affected river sections.;                     </jats:p>",13,11,2753,2762,Photogrammetry; Natural disaster; Satellite; Geography; Aerial video; Flood mapping; Cartography; Remote sensing,,,,,https://nhess.copernicus.org/articles/13/2753/2013/nhess-13-2753-2013-discussion.html https://nhess.copernicus.org/articles/13/2753/2013/nhess-13-2753-2013.pdf https://noa.gwlb.de/receive/cop_mods_00021176 https://www.nat-hazards-earth-syst-sci.net/13/2753/2013/nhess-13-2753-2013.pdf http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013NHESD...1.2859T/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/nhess-13-2753-2013,10.5194/nhess-13-2753-2013,2055230908,,0,011-165-874-683-362; 012-385-805-199-658; 020-234-750-093-486; 038-100-702-021-293; 040-184-564-272-635; 052-232-116-683-034; 057-545-918-303-995; 072-615-071-188-518; 079-150-284-796-055; 085-438-405-707-582; 121-362-424-776-810; 176-325-087-688-467,34,,(doi) 10.5194/nhess-13-2753-2013; (coreid) 90081238; (magid) 2055230908,en

Stilwell; Donald C. Rundquist; David B. Marx; Gary L. Hein,"The wheat curl mite (WCM), Aceria tosichella Keifer, transmits three potentially devastating viruses to winter wheat. An increased understanding of mite movement and subsequent virus spread through the landscape is necessary to estimate the risk of epidemics by the virus in winter wheat. Owing to the small size of WCMs, their dispersal via wind is hard to monitor; however, the viruses they transmit produce symptoms that can be detected with remote sensing. The objective of this study was to characterize the spatial dispersal of the virus from a central mite-virus source. Virus infection gradients were measured spatially by using aerial remote sensing, ground measurements, geostatistics, and a geographic information system between 2006 and 2009. The red edge position vegetation index as measured via aerial imagery was significantly correlated with in-field biophysical measurements. The occurrence of virus symptoms extended differentially in all directions from mite-virus source plots, and predictions from cokriging revealed an oval pattern surrounding the source but displaced to the southeast. The variable dispersal in different directions appeared to be influenced by the mite source density and wind direction and speed, but temperature also seemed likely to have affected mite spread. The spatial spread revealed in this study may be used to estimate the potential sphere of influence of mite-infested volunteer wheat in production fields. These risk parameter estimates require further validation, but they may potentially aid growers in making better virus management decisions regarding differential virus spread potential away from a central source.",103,2,338,344,Wind direction; Geostatistics; Virus; Wheat streak mosaic virus; Mite; Red edge position; Winter wheat; Biological dispersal; Agronomy; Biology,,Animals; Mites/virology; Potyviridae/physiology; Triticum/virology,,USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture North Central Integrated Pest Management Grants Program,https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1782&context=entomologyfacpub https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/entomologyfacpub/747/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30562136,http://dx.doi.org/10.1094/pdis-01-18-0025-re,10.1094/pdis-01-18-0025-re,2888160528,,0,010-420-516-474-906; 010-900-435-175-974; 011-521-752-766-66X; 011-973-578-788-157; 012-061-714-018-849; 013-866-320-431-627; 020-935-195-148-397; 022-480-015-032-069; 023-652-737-209-078; 024-756-307-492-697; 025-520-205-514-010; 025-688-339-591-088; 029-183-544-150-160; 029-627-024-977-089; 030-633-357-982-077; 042-240-151-955-143; 042-581-077-460-120; 042-624-593-926-553; 046-993-350-874-030; 049-211-013-291-109; 051-092-747-869-62X; 051-442-119-908-007; 057-532-087-503-44X; 065-113-005-078-149; 068-953-042-916-456; 072-651-487-096-383; 095-115-526-131-133; 102-935-266-198-061; 103-728-392-588-794; 108-052-345-870-281; 112-497-791-089-993; 121-993-950-723-744; 126-978-499-167-224; 177-935-748-824-361; 192-011-036-913-589,2,,(pmid) 30562136; (doi) 10.1094/pdis-01-18-0025-re; (magid) 2888160528,en

Numerous studies have been accomplished to analyze and evaluate the tourism conditions of a place using free and near-real-time data sources such as social media. This study demonstrates the potential of volunteered geographic information, mainly Twitter and OpenStreetMap, for discovering tourism areas of interest. Active tweet clusters generated using Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) clustering algorithm and building footprint information are used to identify touristic places that ensure the availability of basic essential facilities for travelers. Furthermore, an investigation is made to examine the usefulness of nighttime light remotely sensed data to recognize such tourism areas. The study successfully discovered important tourism areas in urban and remote regions in Nepal which have relatively low social media penetration. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is examined using the F1 measure. The accuracy assessment showed F1 score of 0.72 and 0.74 in the selected regions.

This research proposes a new approach for the accumulation of OpenStreetMap (OSM) data by using OSM Notes and attempts to analyze the geographical distribution and the characteristics of the contents of the contributions, quantitatively and qualitatively. Subsequently, the results demonstrated regional differences in OSM Notes, but it provided users with an understanding of the new features of quality management in OSM, even in regions where OSM activities are not necessarily active. In addition, it was also possible to discover new factors such as the time transition required for the correction and contribution of anonymous users.

Beside the data itself, data about community activity provides valuable insights into the mapping progress which can be useful for estimating data quality, understanding the activity of VGI communities or predicting future developments. This work proposes a conceptual as well as technical framework for structuring and analyzing mapping activity building on the concepts of activity theory. Taking OpenStreetMap as an example, the work outlines the necessary steps for converting database changes into user- and feature-centered operations and higher-level actions acting as a universal scheme for arbitrary spatio-temporal analyses of mapping activities. Different examples from continent to region and city-scale analyses demonstrate the practicability of the approach. Instead of focusing on the interpretation of specific analysis results, the work contributes on a meta-level by addressing several conceptual and technical questions with respect to the overall process of analyzing VGI community activity",5,3,37,,Database-centric architecture; Geography; Data quality; Data science; Structuring; Open data; Knowledge management; Volunteered geographic information,,,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/5/3/37 https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi5030037 https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/5/3/37/pdf https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi5030037 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016IJGI....5...37R/abstract https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ijgi/ijgi5.html#RehrlG16 https://core.ac.uk/display/89676462,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi5030037,10.3390/ijgi5030037,2298533687,,0,000-701-242-851-10X; 008-714-358-699-609; 009-268-949-120-928; 016-707-019-886-869; 026-645-756-189-301; 029-340-611-176-878; 030-975-962-975-895; 034-212-540-698-648; 035-903-136-289-884; 042-402-901-389-048; 057-234-450-827-428; 057-545-918-303-995; 074-553-217-053-432; 075-869-838-337-064; 090-934-085-480-959; 106-146-414-874-935; 145-350-454-429-564; 147-876-713-700-216; 174-138-909-388-097,17,,(magid) 2298533687; (doi) 10.3390/ijgi5030037; (coreid) 89676462,en
043-048-736-852-883,A Review of OpenStreetMap Data,2017-09-11,2017,book chapter,Mapping and the Citizen Sensor,,Ubiquity Press,,Peter Mooney; Marco Minghini,"While there is now a considerable variety of sources of Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) available, discussion of this domain is often exemplified by and focused around OpenStreetMap (OSM). In a little over a decade OSM has become the leading example of VGI on the Internet. OSM is not just a crowdsourced spatial database of VGI; rather, it has grown to become a vast ecosystem of data, software systems and applications, tools, and Web-based information stores such as wikis. An increasing number of developers, industry actors, researchers and other end users are making use of OSM in their applications. OSM has been shown to compare favourably with other sources of spatial data in terms of data quality. In addition to this, a very large OSM community updates data within OSM on a regular basis. This chapter provides an introduction to and review of OSM and the ecosystem which has grown to support the mission of creating a free, editable map of the whole world. The chapter is especially meant for readers who have no or little knowledge about the range, maturity and complexity of the tools, services, applications and organisations working with OSM data. We provide examples of tools and services to access, edit, visualise and make quality assessments of OSM data. We also provide a number of examples of applications, such as some of those used in navigation and routing, that use OSM data directly. The chapter finishes with an indication of where OSM will be discussed in the other chapters in this book, and we provide a brief speculative outlook on what the future holds for the OSM project.",,,37,59,The Internet; Software system; Spatial analysis; Spatial database; Data quality; Data science; Open data; Computer science; Volunteered geographic information; End user,,,,,https://www.ubiquitypress.com/site/chapters/10.5334/bbf.c/ https://core.ac.uk/display/157613691 https://www.ubiquitypress.com/site/chapters/e/10.5334/bbf.c/,http://dx.doi.org/10.5334/bbf.c,10.5334/bbf.c,2756319556,,0,,29,,(doi) 10.5334/bbf.c; (magid) 2756319556,en

Although they have free and openly availability advantages, only a small proportion is related to situation awareness, and reliability or trustworthiness is a challenge. A credibility framework is proposed for Twitter data in the context of disaster situation awareness. The framework is derived from crowdsourcing, which states that errors propagated in volunteered information decrease as the number of contributors increases. In the proposed framework, credibility is hierarchically assessed on two tweet levels. The framework was tested using Hurricane Harvey Twitter data, in which situation awareness related tweets were extracted using a set of predefined keywords including power, shelter, damage, casualty, and flood. For each tweet, text messages and associated URLs were integrated to enhance the information completeness. Events were identified by aggregating tweets based on their topics and spatiotemporal characteristics. Credibility for events was calculated and analyzed against the spatial, temporal, and social impacting scales. This framework has the potential to calculate the evolving credibility in real time, providing users insight on the most important and trustworthy events.</jats:p>",8,3,111,,Situation awareness; Trustworthiness; Data science; Credibility; Natural hazard; Completeness (statistics); Computer science; Social media; Crowdsourcing; Flood myth,,,,"Center for Hierarchical Manufacturing, National Science Foundation",https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ijgi/ijgi8.html#YangYQLY19 https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/8/3/111/pdf https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/8/3/111 https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi8030111,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi8030111,10.3390/ijgi8030111,2918166202,,0,002-757-931-017-087; 005-896-305-143-114; 007-803-954-123-68X; 012-199-283-061-141; 020-132-620-861-048; 028-695-040-854-706; 033-222-825-921-797; 033-497-992-382-885; 039-937-817-932-418; 049-887-957-428-731; 051-840-520-474-368; 055-692-184-508-904; 056-753-232-667-081; 057-545-918-303-995; 073-021-026-754-291; 077-234-041-484-589; 084-811-015-817-002; 088-972-413-213-004; 094-797-724-860-542; 097-612-174-011-049; 102-750-049-393-724; 105-033-023-866-21X; 108-557-946-585-914; 120-518-308-946-554; 131-803-513-768-170,11,,(doi) 10.3390/ijgi8030111; (magid) 2918166202,en

W. Lurz; Walter Bertoldi,"In the UK, alien grey squirrels have been replacing the native red squirrel for >100 years and by the turn of the century the distribution of grey squirrels had extended to most of central and southern England and Wales (apart from some islands), and large parts of Scotland and Ireland. To understand how this species replacement may continue into the future, we explore 20 years of squirrel records (1991-2010) collected in an unsystematic way by volunteers in northern England and Scotland. To aid analysis, we standardised the data to one record of squirrel presence per 4 km square per year in each of six geographic regions, two in northern England and four in Scotland. Over the 20 years and across all regions, the number of 4 km squares that returned the presence of squirrels increased from 23% to 80%. The evolving distribution pattern of red and grey squirrels differed among the regions and was complex with occupancy records for many 4 km squares changing from red to grey squirrel from one year to the next, but also some changing from grey to red squirrel. The net rate of change, however, was from red to grey squirrel with the exception of the more recent years, 2007-2010, when this trend became less distinct. Estimates of the complete loss of red squirrels assuming current trends, varied from the 2020s in northern England to 2104 in North East Scotland. The recent incertitudes in the replacement of red by grey squirrels may, at least in part, result from increasing efforts to control grey squirrels in these regions. Although the volunteer data presented are valuable, monitoring aims must be clearly defined and sampling designs involving volunteers and professionals must be systematic and of sufficient effort to obtain reliable information on changes in distribution and population trends.

043-484-989-874-942,Natural disasters: arsenic spike from Ike.,,2009,journal article,Environmental health perspectives,15529924; 00916765,"Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services",United States,Naomi Lubick,"A study of the sediment left behind by flooding from Hurricane Ike in September 2008 shows that although levels of most of the toxic compounds assayed are low, some concerns remain about elevated arsenic levels. The larger impact, however, may come from the cooperation between scientists and community members, whose combined effort has yielded valuable insights as coastal communities gear up for the 2009 hurricane season.; ; To determine exactly what Hurricane Ike delivered, researchers from the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) in Galveston joined local volunteers from community organizations to collect sediment samples. The samples, collected from hard surfaces to distinguish flood-borne sediment from pre-existing soil, were analyzed at a nearby laboratory. The results showed mostly “good news,” the team reported in the February 2009 white paper “Analysis for Toxic Materials in Sediments from Hurricane Ike in Galveston, TX.” The sediment did not contain sufficient levels of most pollutants measured—such as polychlorinated biphenyls, dioxins, and petroleum products—to require remediation.; ; However, several sites had elevated levels of some metals, including arsenic at amounts up to 48 times the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s residential screening level, although below the level that legally requires cleanup. Moreover, the highest arsenic levels were found in a particularly poor neighborhood. “Without adequate information and self-protection,” the team wrote, “this community will likely suffer a heavier exposure burden, and may be most vulnerable to the effects of that burden.”; ; The report is not comprehensive, the team acknowledges; the nine samples collected cannot show the complete picture, and the analytical tests were basic. However, with the resources at hand (and a $7,500 budget), the minimal data set is enough to support the team’s basic conclusions: floodwaters tend to stir up what’s already there, while sometimes adding more contaminants from elsewhere, depending on where the floodwaters originated.; ; Some likely sources of the arsenic in Galveston include now-defunct industrial sites, says project co-investigator Jonathan Ward. An old tin smelter across Galveston Bay, for example, once dumped its waste into a channel that directly flowed into the estuary, Ward says. Co-investigator Sharon Petronella says the UTMB team wants to map out such “legacy” contaminants in a geographic information system to serve as a “predecessor for a risk assessment working backwards.”; ; Howard Mielke, a research professor at Tulane University who has documented lead-laden soils of New Orleans and other cities, notes that such a historical record would have been useful in assessing Hurricane Ike flood deposits. With 22% of the Galveston samples containing lead levels over 200 ppm, Mielke says the post-Ike lead content seems relatively high. He adds, “Because of their extraordinary vulnerability, no child should be playing in soil with a lead content above 100 ppm.”; ; The sediment monitoring project is part of UTMB’s LEAST Lead Initiative, which seeks to reduce lead poisoning in Galveston in cooperation with county and state agencies and with St. Vincent’s House, a nonprofit social service agency. The impetus for the monitoring project came from St. Vincent’s executive director Michael Jackson, who rallied support at a meeting in the gutted bottom story of the agency a few weeks after Ike struck. Petronella says, “If you don’t have a community voice at the table, you are not going to understand what the community needs.” Community involvement such as having residents tell their neighbors how to protect babies from hand-to-mouth exposure had been important to LEAST Lead’s efforts prior to Hurricane Ike and proved equally effective with regard to exposure to flood debris and sediments.; ; Researchers outside the project agree that the collaborative nature of the work is a positive highlight of the report. Research geochemist Geoff Plumlee of the U.S. Geological Survey, who assessed New Orleans flood deposits after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, says the report “actually got me thinking about things we could do at the local grass-roots level, because that’s clearly where the impacts are.”",117,7,A294,,Environmental resource management; Natural disaster; Social work; Flooding (psychology); Ecology; Geography; White paper; Geological survey; Community organization; Environmental monitoring; Flood myth,,Arsenic/analysis; Disasters; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants/analysis; Geologic Sediments/analysis; Humans; Texas; United States,Environmental Pollutants; Arsenic,,https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/ehp.117-a294a https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2717156/ http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC2717156 https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-206048817/arsenic-spike-from-ike,http://dx.doi.org/10.1289/ehp.117-a294a,10.1289/ehp.117-a294a,66959788,PMC2717156,0,,1,,(pmcid) pmc2717156; (pmid) 19654899; (doi) 10.1289/ehp.117-a294a; (magid) 66959788,en

The effects of the Shenzhen greenway network on supporting physical activities,,2016,journal article,Landscape and Urban Planning,01692046,Elsevier BV,Netherlands,Kun Liu; Kin Wai Michael Siu; Xi Yong Gong; Yuan Gao; Dan Lu,"In recent decades, greenways have been the focus of an international movement to improve urban environment quality. In metropolitan areas, more greenways are interconnected, forming a greenway network (GN). A GN is considered to encourage physical activities, but verifying this statement is difficult, as traditional social survey methods do not obtain fine-grain activity geographic data on a large scale. In view of this shortcoming, the volunteered geographic information and the geographic information system techniques were used to describe the distribution of physical activities in a GN, to explore the effects of greenway network features on supporting activities. The 1640-km-long Shenzhen GN was selected as a representative case, and walking, jogging and cycling were chosen as typical activities. The results showed that only a quarter of greenways were with activities. Greenways with dense residences, mixed land-use, advanced street network and large parks yielded positive effects on supporting physical activities, and advanced public transportation further improved activity diversity. Due to the spatial mismatch between the GN distribution and well-developed areas, the GN density showed negative effects on the presence of physical activities; within the greenways in use, the GN density significantly improved activity diversity, indicating the positive effect of network feature on supporting activities. Compared with neighbourhood greenways, city and regional greenways supported more physical activities due to richer natural resources. The findings reveal that GN in green and welldeveloped areas supports physical activities better. Location, green quality and network form are necessary for greenways and should be integrated into GN planning.School of Desig",152,,49,58,Built environment; Metropolitan area; Neighbourhood (mathematics); Geography; Street network; Geographic information system; Public transport; Volunteered geographic information; Spatial mismatch; Environmental planning,,,,Hong Kong Polytechnic University; National Natural Science Foundation of China; Landscape and Urban Planning,https://research.polyu.edu.hk/en/publications/where-do-networks-really-work-the-effects-of-the-shenzhen-greenwa http://ira.lib.polyu.edu.hk/bitstream/10397/61479/1/Liu_Where_networks_really.pdf http://ira.lib.polyu.edu.hk/handle/10397/61479 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169204616300160 https://core.ac.uk/display/78915448,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2016.04.001,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2016.04.001,2342451409,,0,000-925-165-034-140; 001-839-222-833-367; 010-290-394-258-945; 014-856-191-062-980; 025-003-532-395-842; 025-956-408-020-683; 028-925-284-905-769; 033-909-729-049-67X; 043-214-274-950-542; 044-386-634-692-67X; 056-806-128-680-725; 057-545-918-303-995; 064-503-437-272-786; 065-711-998-427-082; 067-868-441-981-797; 069-841-017-770-192; 070-186-545-599-883; 075-008-815-861-053; 076-484-786-191-188; 087-796-176-262-366; 093-546-326-236-290; 103-415-392-299-709; 117-441-600-178-416; 117-813-640-396-404; 117-971-355-916-646; 122-906-321-873-764; 129-612-820-182-74X; 137-767-043-242-379; 144-027-353-702-561; 150-550-994-428-05X; 153-542-156-060-937; 162-866-903-375-287; 165-731-623-170-624; 171-904-759-316-08X; 178-493-212-000-912; 191-055-475-123-333,24,,(doi) 10.1016/j.landurbplan.2016.04.001; (magid) 2342451409; (coreid) 78915448,en

Since an easy to use high-level language for querying and manipulating collections of possibly geo-tagged JSON objects is still unavailable, we propose a truly declarative language, named J-CO-QL, that is based on a well-defined execution model. A plug-in for a GIS permits to visualize geo-tagged data sets stored in a NoSQL database such as MongoDB; furthermore, the same plug-in can be used to write and execute J-CO-QL queries on those databases.

Goodchild,"The past four decades have witnessed a rapid and accelerating growth in the use of computers to handle geographic information. As machines, computers require that inputs be formalized, following well-defined rules and using shared definitions of terms. This requirement has created a fundamental tension with the informal world of human discourse, and nowhere is this more apparent than over the vague concept of place. The chapter explores this tension from various perspectives: current methods of geographic representation in digital form, inherent ambiguities, the case of the gazetteer, the role of volunteered geographic information, and place as an expression of context. Examples are used to illustrate the basic principles.",,,21,33,Data science; Computer science; Geographic information system; Volunteered geographic information,,,,,https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4419-7482-2_2 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4419-7482-2_2/fulltext.html https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-1-4419-7482-2_2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4419-7482-2_2,10.1007/978-1-4419-7482-2_2,148230327,,0,004-331-296-096-867; 007-564-489-271-445; 010-799-188-284-44X; 012-799-188-583-493; 019-029-287-138-022; 025-827-031-800-338; 032-583-038-746-042; 035-488-601-792-552; 036-654-682-958-24X; 040-617-828-342-31X; 055-698-036-607-609; 061-268-888-638-760; 078-121-721-499-499; 080-837-714-027-886; 081-673-402-045-602; 081-688-302-981-112; 083-277-505-532-209; 083-809-207-024-729; 088-838-729-451-140; 106-209-907-666-435; 106-922-295-646-807; 110-815-359-805-370; 150-030-781-614-896; 159-096-514-056-331; 198-527-202-666-479,63,,(doi) 10.1007/978-1-4419-7482-2_2; (magid) 148230327,en

Hence, new opportunities arise for regional exploration that can lead to improvements in the lives of citizens through spatial decision support. We believe that the VGI data of the urban environment could be used to present a constructive overview of the regional infrastructure with the advent of web technologies. Current location-based services provide general map-based information for the end users with conventional local search functionality, and hence, the presentation of the rich urban information is limited. In this work, we analyze the OSM data to classify the geo entities into consequential categories with facilities, landscape and land use distribution. We employ a visual overlay of heat map and interactive visualizations to present the regional characterization on OSM data classification. In the proposed interface, users are allowed to express a variety of spatial queries to exemplify their geographic interests. They can compare the characterization of urban areas with respect to multiple spatial dimensions of interest and can search for the most suitable region. The search experience is further enhanced via efficient optimization and interaction methods to support the decision making of end users. We report the end user acceptability and efficiency of the proposed system via usability studies and performance analysis comparison",4,1,87,104,Decision support system; Local search (optimization); Spatial analysis; Usability; Geography; Data science; Data classification; Land use; Volunteered geographic information; End user,,,,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft,https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/4/1/87 http://core.ac.uk/display/29431269 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015IJGI....4...87K/abstract https://core.ac.uk/display/29431269 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ijgi/ijgi4.html#KumarHB15 https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/4/1/87/pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi4010087,10.3390/ijgi4010087,2076889106,,0,008-097-974-700-035; 012-367-847-168-56X; 014-294-840-220-474; 021-585-871-448-213; 024-246-787-231-540; 027-277-768-551-574; 038-976-596-179-447; 039-008-601-346-536; 039-277-140-490-345; 039-331-737-803-505; 043-714-141-467-996; 049-323-396-604-497; 049-440-336-275-591; 050-056-957-578-770; 053-305-406-664-158; 057-545-918-303-995; 059-470-641-221-645; 062-081-433-137-886; 063-796-085-526-580; 066-052-455-453-487; 083-020-091-311-559; 085-320-053-548-931; 118-571-042-399-012; 127-803-600-594-629; 132-433-687-035-672; 144-517-582-895-274; 190-216-777-739-959,6,,(magid) 2076889106; (doi) 10.3390/ijgi4010087; (coreid) 29431269,en

This paper, based on the data from China’s OpenStreetMap road network in May 2014, taking 340 prefecture-level cities in China as its study area, presents the geometric-related (road density) and attribute-related (type diversity) spatial patterns of the OpenStreetMap road network, and explores their relationship. The results are as follows. (1) The distribution of OpenStreetMap road density in Shenzhen, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Macao predominantly obeys a “positive skewness distribution”. OpenStreetMap data for eastern China shows a higher overall and circular structure. In central China, there are noticeable discrepancies in the road density, whereas in western China, the road density is low. (2) The OpenStreetMap road diversity shows a normal distribution. The spatial pattern for the so-called “Hu Huanyong line” was broken by the effect of diplomatic and strategic factors, showing a high diversity along the peripheral border, coastal cities, and core inland cites. (3) China’s OpenStreetMap is partitioned into four parts according to road density and diversity: high density and high diversity; low density and low diversity; high density and low diversity; and low density high diversity. (4) The OpenStreetMap geographical information-collection process and mechanism were analyzed, demonstrating that the road density reflects the preponderance of traffic in the real world. OpenStreetMap road diversity reflects the road-related geographic information demand and value, and it also reflects the interests of users toward to OpenStreetMap geographical information.",4,2,135,146,Spatial ecology; Common spatial pattern; China; Geography; Neogeography; Global Map; Road networks; Central china; Volunteered geographic information; Cartography,,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2226585615000199 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2226585615000199 https://core.ac.uk/display/90860959 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82414839.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jum.2015.10.001,10.1016/j.jum.2015.10.001,2208484583,,0,005-577-928-894-522; 022-473-450-579-960; 022-816-728-271-154; 026-645-756-189-301; 028-739-825-417-25X; 030-389-215-141-473; 030-438-589-276-899; 038-976-596-179-447; 039-008-601-346-536; 041-490-320-644-385; 047-100-212-874-054; 057-545-918-303-995; 057-723-556-715-325; 065-721-408-933-444; 066-101-498-522-68X; 068-196-620-287-79X; 071-081-887-211-637; 080-711-536-952-88X; 083-815-629-123-031; 084-376-137-252-907; 088-339-711-439-200; 098-565-405-790-308; 100-487-196-651-545; 103-231-819-030-471; 106-264-944-278-433; 107-669-843-668-207; 111-836-676-602-656; 131-407-165-298-680; 136-570-589-999-562; 141-379-047-933-361; 147-122-185-848-274; 158-284-945-233-768; 170-767-348-108-054; 180-811-306-799-043; 190-216-777-739-959; 195-019-623-135-107,28,,(magid) 2208484583; (doi) 10.1016/j.jum.2015.10.001; (coreid) 82414839,en

Some VGI is very focused on the creation of map-based products, while in other applications location is simply one attribute that is routinely collected, due to the proliferation of Global Positioning System (GPS) enabled devices, e.g. mobile phones and tablets. This chapter aims to provide an overview of the variety of sources of VGI currently available, categorised according to whether they can contribute to framework data (i.e. the type of data that are commonly part of the spatial data infrastructure of national mapping agencies and governments) or not and whether the data have been actively or passively collected. A range of examples are presented to illustrate the different types of VGI in each of these main categories.

Six years later (2005-2011), OpenStreetMap and Google Earth (GE) are now full-fledged, crowdsourced 'Wikipedias of the Earth' par excellence, with millions of users contributing their own layers to GE, attaching photos, videos, notes and even 3-D (three dimensional) models to locations in GE. From using Twitter in participatory sensing and bicycle-mounted sensors in pervasive environmental sensing, to creating a 100,000-sensor geo-mashup using Semantic Web technology, to the 3-D visualisation of indoor and outdoor surveillance data in real-time and the development of next-generation, collaborative natural user interfaces that will power the spatially-enabled public health and emergency situation rooms of the future, where sensor data and citizen reports can be triaged and acted upon in real-time by distributed teams of professionals, this paper offers a comprehensive state-of-the-art review of the overlapping domains of the Sensor Web, citizen sensing and 'human-in-the-loop sensing' in the era of the Mobile and Social Web, and the roles these domains can play in environmental and public health surveillance and crisis/disaster informatics. We provide an in-depth review of the key issues and trends in these areas, the challenges faced when reasoning and making decisions with real-time crowdsourced data (such as issues of information overload, ""noise"", misinformation, bias and trust), the core technologies and Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards involved (Sensor Web Enablement and Open GeoSMS), as well as a few outstanding project implementation examples from around the world.",10,1,67,67,Data mining; Web 2.0; World Wide Web; Sensor web; Semantic Web; Geoweb; Participatory sensing; Computer science; Social web; Volunteered geographic information; Crowdsourcing,,"Algorithms; Computer Simulation; Computer Systems; Crowding; Data Collection/instrumentation; Environmental Health/instrumentation; Geographic Information Systems/instrumentation; Global Health; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Internet/instrumentation; Knowledge; Man-Machine Systems; Medical Informatics; Population Surveillance/methods; Public Health/instrumentation; Social Media/instrumentation; Software; United Kingdom",,,https://aran.library.nuigalway.ie/handle/10379/7230 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22188675 https://paperity.org/p/56217413/crowdsourcing-citizen-sensing-and-sensor-web-technologies-for-public-and-environmental http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3271966 http://www.ij-healthgeographics.com/content/pdf/1476-072X-10-67.pdf https://pure.uhi.ac.uk/en/publications/crowdsourcing-citizen-sensing-and-sensor-web-technologies-for-pub https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1186/1476-072X-10-67 https://ij-healthgeographics.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/1476-072X-10-67 https://www.library.nuigalway.ie/handle/10379/7230?show=full https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/69246 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1476-072X-10-67 https://www.deri.ie/sites/default/files/publications/boulos-et-al-crowdsourcing-citizen-sensing-and-sensor-web-technologies-for-public-and-environmental-health-surveillance-and-crisis-management-trends-ogc-standards-and-application-examples.pdf https://doaj.org/article/2c9adc5da89e4f949b0fefdf1d45bcaa https://aran.library.nuigalway.ie/bitstream/10379/7230/1/20111211_ijhg2011.pdf https://uni-salzburg.elsevierpure.com/de/publications/crowdsourcing-citizen-sensing-and-sensor-web-technologies-for-pub https://ij-healthgeographics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1476-072X-10-67,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1476-072x-10-67,10.1186/1476-072x-10-67,2122803056,PMC3271966,7,001-092-652-733-283; 001-992-774-630-286; 002-962-088-383-077; 005-940-255-051-072; 011-971-070-363-896; 014-022-399-856-21X; 014-364-377-181-59X; 017-884-355-820-221; 024-852-705-207-396; 027-991-394-082-053; 029-939-574-461-258; 032-083-558-684-470; 043-610-630-357-898; 043-973-536-005-16X; 044-928-993-484-614; 045-893-102-253-572; 051-733-151-918-029; 052-600-202-607-624; 056-382-484-741-807; 057-040-097-643-496; 057-545-918-303-995; 062-497-209-491-935; 064-336-422-589-187; 071-550-241-237-001; 074-228-201-992-823; 079-017-160-423-908; 080-546-859-360-065; 081-561-900-584-186; 088-595-202-611-159; 090-009-664-150-622; 095-697-695-786-782; 097-063-730-605-915; 098-717-959-350-523; 100-238-668-851-40X; 105-687-904-950-668; 112-900-932-253-652; 118-535-591-586-816; 123-747-356-349-71X; 135-360-535-210-851; 138-274-536-532-623; 140-412-510-067-65X; 162-971-952-988-80X; 163-489-782-272-411; 164-706-255-616-635; 165-323-367-273-989; 178-841-402-537-081; 183-974-374-663-979; 193-075-819-835-459; 193-310-519-349-536,335,"research support, non-u.s. gov't",(doi) 10.1186/1476-072x-10-67; (magid) 2122803056; (pmcid) pmc3271966; (pii) 1476-072x-10-67; (pmid) 22188675; (coreid) 28475699,en

Taking advantage of these technological achievements, this paper presents a new approach for a citizen-orientated framework of spatial planning that aims at integrating participatory community work into existing decision-making structures. One major cornerstone of the presented approach is the application of a social geoweb platform (the GeoCitizen platform) that combines geo-web technologies and social media in one single tool allowing citizens to collaboratively report observations, discuss ideas, solve, and monitor problems in their living environment at a local level.

The process is mostly automated, it was developed to be applied in a time- and resource-constrained environment and keeps the human factor in the loop in order to control the final decisions. We show that through this process the cognitive load (CL) for an expert image analyst will be reduced by 70%, while the process will successfully identify 85.6% of the potential landing sites.

Kröhnert; A. Eltner,"<jats:p>In the last decades, an increase in the number of extreme precipitation events has been observed, which leads to increasing risks for flash floods and landslides. Thereby, conventional gauging stations are indispensable for monitoring and prediction. However, they are expensive in construction, management, and maintenance. Thus, density of observation networks is rather low, leading to insufficient spatio-temporal resolution to capture hydrological extreme events that occur with short response times especially in small-scale catchments. Smaller creeks and rivers require permanent observation, as well, to allow for a better understanding of the underlying processes and to enhance forecasting reliability.&lt;br&gt; Today’s smartphones with inbuilt cameras, positioning sensors and powerful processing units may serve as wide-spread measurement devices for event-based water gauging during floods. With the aid of volunteered geographic information (VGI), the hydrological network of water gauges can be highly densified in its spatial and temporal domain even for currently unobserved catchments. Furthermore, stationary low-cost solutions based on Raspberry Pi imaging systems are versatile for permanent monitoring of hydrological parameters. Both complementary systems, i.e. smartphone and Raspberry Pi camera, share the same methodology to extract water levels automatically, which is explained in the paper in detail. The annotation of 3D reference data by 2D image measurements is addressed depending on camera setup and river section to be monitored. Accuracies for water stage measurements are in range of several millimetres up to few centimetres.;                     </jats:p>",XLII-2,,543,550,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-xlii-2-543-2018,10.5194/isprs-archives-xlii-2-543-2018,,,0,,5,,(doi) 10.5194/isprs-archives-xlii-2-543-2018,en

H. van Vliet,"The increasing availability of volunteered geographic information (VGI) enables novel studies in many scientific domains. However, inconsistent VGI can negatively affect these studies. This paper describes a workflow that checks the consistency of Volunteered Phenological Observations (VPOs) while considering the synchrony of observations (i.e., the temporal dispersion of a phenological event). The geographic coordinates, day of the year (DOY) of the observed event, and the accumulation of daily temperature until that DOY were used to: (1) spatially group VPOs by connecting observations that are near to each other, (2) define consistency constraints, (3) check the consistency of VPOs by evaluating the defined constraints, and (4) optimize the constraints by analysing the effect of inconsistent VPOs on the synchrony models derived from the observations. This workflow was tested using VPOs collected in the Netherlands during the period 2003–2015. We found that the average percentage of inconsistent observations was low to moderate (ranging from 1% for wood anemone and pedunculate oak to 15% for cow parsley species). This indicates that volunteers provide reliable phenological information. We also found a significant correlation between the standard deviation of DOY of the observed events and the accumulation of daily temperature (with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.78 for lesser celandine, and 0.60 for pedunculate oak). This confirmed that colder days in late winter and early spring lead to synchronous flowering and leafing onsets. Our results highlighted the potential of synchrony information and geographical context for checking the consistency of phenological VGI. Other domains using VGI can adapt this geocomputational workflow to check the consistency of their data, and hence the robustness of their analyses.",7,12,487,,Statistics; Correlation; Standard deviation; Data quality; Synchronous flowering; Late winter; Mathematics; Phenology; Volunteered geographic information,,,,,https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Alibrary.wur.nl%3Awurpubs%2F553302 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018IJGI....7..487M/abstract https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/6492127 https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/7/12/487/pdf https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi7120487 https://research.utwente.nl/en/publications/checking-the-consistency-of-volunteered-phenological-observations https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ijgi/ijgi7.html#MehdipoorZAV18 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20193507078 https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/7/12/487,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi7120487,10.3390/ijgi7120487,2904715114,,0,001-312-513-342-639; 002-092-842-194-504; 003-562-196-270-786; 008-468-938-437-452; 008-655-662-451-459; 008-687-218-014-777; 010-328-091-480-769; 010-436-855-495-142; 015-101-584-755-308; 015-678-344-819-698; 017-279-450-521-443; 017-430-639-729-730; 020-132-620-861-048; 023-477-967-802-189; 024-421-722-979-369; 025-847-175-638-067; 026-256-495-228-931; 028-831-155-605-965; 030-975-962-975-895; 031-565-891-241-935; 033-549-829-176-725; 038-976-596-179-447; 041-832-785-591-882; 042-759-985-127-425; 043-785-921-142-584; 047-906-687-312-234; 048-400-414-195-536; 050-413-731-527-439; 051-618-797-342-926; 051-714-154-594-660; 053-942-002-329-363; 060-515-184-203-565; 068-012-890-337-292; 075-237-579-647-74X; 076-172-774-771-027; 076-328-384-024-286; 081-735-103-507-572; 083-343-893-611-103; 089-445-519-317-292; 094-687-538-506-972; 097-338-432-344-323; 097-612-174-011-049; 099-187-285-555-637; 100-212-436-983-387; 100-950-754-400-778; 103-236-644-586-971; 109-645-535-836-965; 111-584-437-903-293; 124-941-043-215-302; 129-840-535-945-781; 130-608-795-409-423; 130-612-326-532-455; 170-614-254-653-257,3,,(doi) 10.3390/ijgi7120487; (magid) 2904715114,en

With the increasing size and complexity of public buildings, such as universities or hotels, there is also an increasing demand for information about indoor spaces. Trying to stimulate this growing demand, both researchers and Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) communities envision to extend established communities towards indoors. It has already been showcased that VGI from OpenStreetMap (OSM) can be utilized for different applications in Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDIs) as well as for simple shortest path computations inside buildings. The here presented research now tries to utilize crowdsourced indoor geodata for more complex indoor routing scenarios of multiple users. Essentially, it will be investigated if, and to what extent, the available data can be utilized for performing indoor evacuation simulations with the simulation framework MATSim. That is, this paper investigates the suitability of crowdsourced indoor information from OSM (IndoorOSM) for evacuation simulations. Additionally, the applicability of MATSim for agent-based indoor evacuation simulations is conducted. The paper discusses the automatic generation simulation-related data, and provides experimental results for two different evacuation scenarios. Furthermore, limitations of the IndoorOSM data and the MATSim framework for indoor evacuation simulations are elaborated and discussed",1,2,186,208,Spatial analysis; Shortest path problem; Data science; Data source; Visualization; Computer science; Volunteered geographic information; Emergency management,,,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/1/2/186/pdf https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012IJGI....1..186G/abstract https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi1020186 https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/1/2/186/htm https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ijgi/ijgi1.html#GoetzZ12,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi1020186,10.3390/ijgi1020186,2079192563,,0,003-537-107-493-677; 005-101-249-573-547; 006-612-965-080-699; 006-617-036-861-469; 010-024-340-417-726; 011-176-035-251-669; 012-899-171-790-38X; 013-321-433-085-185; 013-606-860-303-027; 016-478-978-876-010; 022-273-441-346-181; 022-473-450-579-960; 030-009-656-088-543; 030-217-575-405-566; 032-903-495-847-439; 034-519-237-386-277; 035-122-350-169-435; 038-525-978-985-871; 038-976-596-179-447; 059-922-526-536-531; 064-053-186-811-574; 072-041-535-169-121; 082-276-990-325-922; 083-390-104-481-847; 089-782-469-573-067; 091-404-022-931-861; 093-859-602-633-178; 099-522-795-801-557; 102-782-825-885-948; 107-570-842-090-36X; 118-627-932-611-054; 124-538-052-936-283; 125-059-008-856-41X; 129-105-802-705-002; 132-246-550-138-466; 132-824-163-335-760; 133-529-569-791-605; 138-044-812-913-606; 144-453-856-641-029; 148-382-295-044-151; 148-661-339-137-379; 154-446-904-389-006; 166-885-588-645-839; 184-463-060-847-216; 186-501-134-083-827,19,,(magid) 2079192563; (coreid) 28639592; (doi) 10.3390/ijgi1020186,en

Traditionally, the disease mapping tasks have faced many challenges—(1) authors rarely documented the evidence that were used to create map, (2) before evolution of GIS, many errors aroused in mapping tasks which were expanded extremely at global scales, and (3) there were no fidelity assessment of maps which resulted in inaccurate precision. This study on infectious diseases geo-surveillance is divided into four broad sections with emphasis on handling geographical and temporal issues to help in public health decision-making and planning policies: (1) geospatial mapping of diseases using its spatial and temporal information to understand their behaviour across geography; (2) the citizen’s involvement as volunteers in giving health and disease data to assess the critical situation for disease’s spread and prevention in neighbourhood effect; (3) scientific analysis of health-related behaviour using mathematical epidemiological and geo-statistical approaches with (4) capacity building program. To illustrate each theme, recent case studies are cited and case studies are performed on COVID-19 to demonstrate selected models.",48,8,1121,1138,Geomatics; Public health; Geography; Data science; Neighbourhood effect;

049-887-957-428-731,Constructing gazetteers from volunteered Big Geo-Data based on Hadoop,,2017,journal article,"Computers, Environment and Urban Systems",01989715,Elsevier BV,United Kingdom,Song Gao; Linna Li; Wenwen Li; Krzysztof Janowicz; Yue Zhang,"Traditional gazetteers are built and maintained by authoritative mapping agencies. In the age of Big Data, it is possible to construct gazetteers in a data-driven approach by mining rich volunteered geographic information (VGI) from the Web. In this research, we build a scalable distributed platform and a high-performance geoprocessing workflow based on the Hadoop ecosystem to harvest crowd-sourced gazetteer entries. Using experiments based on geotagged datasets in Flickr, we find that the MapReduce-based workflow running on the spatially enabled Hadoop cluster can reduce the processing time compared with traditional desktop-based operations by an order of magnitude. We demonstrate how to use such a novel spatial-computing infrastructure to facilitate gazetteer research. In addition, we introduce a provenance-based trust model for quality assurance. This work offers new insights on enriching future gazetteers with the use of Hadoop clusters, and makes contributions in connecting GIS to the cloud computing environment for the next frontier of Big Geo-Data analytics.",61,,172,186,Workflow; Geography; Scalable distributed; Geoprocessing workflow; Volunteered geographic information; Big data; Database; Analytics; Cloud computing,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/urban/urban61.html#GaoLLJZ17 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0198971514000209 https://asu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/constructing-gazetteers-from-volunteered-big-geo-data-based-on-ha https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2014.02.004 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0198971514000209,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2014.02.004,10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2014.02.004,2013326020,,0,002-845-432-282-687; 003-838-121-608-097; 005-042-475-367-015; 005-115-376-031-182; 010-469-991-531-778; 011-932-157-652-226; 017-234-652-439-270; 017-747-119-857-611; 017-803-695-631-446; 019-029-287-138-022; 024-250-992-858-248; 026-683-284-616-420; 029-992-786-593-650; 030-223-570-943-665; 034-539-717-431-186; 035-488-601-792-552; 036-654-682-958-24X; 037-451-487-988-458; 040-973-172-347-222; 044-805-473-856-154; 045-217-853-307-195; 048-437-514-437-220; 048-456-967-705-578; 050-332-396-706-418; 051-663-339-530-447; 053-351-390-495-712; 057-545-918-303-995; 059-811-556-102-839; 060-759-954-862-489; 061-033-869-892-660; 065-764-095-693-40X; 065-779-566-608-032; 067-004-999-377-689; 068-049-983-471-609; 068-905-784-999-194; 069-557-620-863-889; 070-576-892-690-271; 071-176-047-886-027; 074-601-456-725-244; 076-968-702-944-72X; 082-545-288-475-456; 082-748-136-701-581; 083-302-243-880-167; 085-661-844-387-826; 088-838-729-451-140; 092-655-509-442-333; 093-048-216-011-38X; 096-213-725-575-04X; 097-338-432-344-323; 097-612-174-011-049; 097-773-332-306-457; 104-500-714-314-370; 105-625-163-810-540; 109-154-193-004-774; 112-447-000-278-072; 117-125-910-733-353; 133-685-124-076-865; 133-769-166-401-88X; 137-292-579-653-532; 146-830-533-083-951; 152-938-290-104-165; 159-815-683-933-84X; 171-539-777-335-775; 175-585-517-644-881; 196-288-317-318-177; 198-527-202-666-479; 199-342-702-513-271,86,,(doi) 10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2014.02.004; (magid) 2013326020,en

Comber; Peter Mooney; Ross S. Purves; Duccio Rocchini; Ariane Walz,"Abstract. This paper describes a simple comparison of the distributions of land cover features identified from volunteered data contributed by different social groups – in this case comparing two groups of Geo-Wiki campaigns. Understanding the impacts on analyses of citizen science data contributed by different groups is critical to ensure robust scientific outputs and to fully realise the potential benefits to formal scientific research. It is well known that different people, with different backgrounds and subject to different cultural factors, hold varying landscape conceptualisations. This paper analyses volunteered geographical information on land cover to generate land cover maps. It uses a geographically weighted approach to generate land cover mappings. The mappings generated by different groups (in this case a from a specific unnamed country) are compared and the results show how the predicted land cover distributions vary, with large differences in some classes (e.g. Barren land, Shrubland, Wetland) and little difference in others (e.g. Tree cover). This suggests that for some landscape features cultural and national differences matter when it comes to using crowdsourced data in formal scientific analyses and highlights the potential problems of not considering contributor backgrounds in citizen science. This is important because such data re now routinely being used to develop global land cover data, to generate uncertainty estimates of existing global land cover products and to generate global forest inventories. These in turn are being suggested as suitable inputs to such things as global climate models. A number of critical research directions arising from these findings are discussed.",XL-3/W3,,71,75,Environmental resource management; Semantics; Social group; Citizen science; Geography; Land cover; Volunteered geographic information; Cartography; Shrubland; Scientific method; Wetland,,,,,https://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/XL-3-W3/71/2015/isprsarchives-XL-3-W3-71-2015.pdf https://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/XL-3-W3/71/2015/ https://noa.gwlb.de/receive/cop_mods_00015515 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ISPAr.XL3...71C/abstract https://openpub.fmach.it/bitstream/10449/29088/4/isprsarchives-XL-3-W3-71-2015.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/isprsarchives-xl-3-w3-71-2015,10.5194/isprsarchives-xl-3-w3-71-2015,2178823567,,0,001-117-752-253-058; 002-555-907-164-663; 010-390-048-140-045; 016-528-071-877-966; 019-868-554-220-635; 021-841-854-481-10X; 023-953-201-270-443; 025-757-285-604-803; 026-187-546-805-334; 027-736-997-184-595; 034-084-644-191-151; 038-976-596-179-447; 040-345-907-238-389; 046-883-091-265-750; 057-545-918-303-995; 064-150-749-224-539; 078-715-695-348-758; 099-523-636-461-537; 107-651-735-933-928; 111-249-750-238-260; 136-570-589-999-562; 141-047-060-911-705; 147-658-527-072-695,2,,(doi) 10.5194/isprsarchives-xl-3-w3-71-2015; (magid) 2178823567; (coreid) 91779442,en

Some daily tasks require visualization skills, especially when in a map-reading context. Augmented Reality systems could provide substantial improvement to geovisualization once it enhances a real scene with virtual information. However, relatively little research has worked on assessing the effective contribution of such systems during map reading. So, this research aims to provide a first look into the usability of an Augmented Reality system prototype for interaction with geoinformation. For this purpose, we have designed an activity with volunteers in order to assess the system prototype usability. We have interviewed 14 users (three experts and 11 non-experts), where experts were subjects with the following characteristics: a professor; with a PhD degree in Cartography, GIS, Geography, or Environmental Sciences/Water Resources; and with experience treating spatial information related to water resources. The activity aimed to detect where the system really helps the user to interpret a hydrographic map and how the users were helped by the Augmented Reality system prototype. We may conclude that the Augmented Reality system was helpful to the users during the map reading, as well as allowing the construction of spatial knowledge within the proposed scenario.",2,3,20,,Human–computer interaction; Geovisualization; Augmented reality; Spatial analysis; Usability; Geography; Augmented reality systems; Map reading; Visualization; Geographic information system,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/bdcc/bdcc2.html#PereiraBC18 https://doi.org/10.3390/bdcc2030020 https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/2/3/20 https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/2/3/20/pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/bdcc2030020,10.3390/bdcc2030020,2887205253,,0,000-978-077-100-135; 003-404-626-709-354; 006-321-683-326-419; 014-164-053-168-093; 022-305-046-187-006; 024-854-754-938-792; 033-261-147-570-546; 035-724-327-430-437; 044-834-431-144-346; 045-869-394-365-700; 047-356-993-207-404; 057-815-547-418-140; 059-837-652-276-332; 070-451-527-219-394; 082-353-783-337-396; 089-604-263-208-804; 094-841-103-679-199; 108-956-312-085-502; 111-558-050-241-679; 129-171-122-225-975; 129-941-718-264-869; 131-016-886-187-878; 151-003-848-105-715; 152-826-980-812-250,1,,(magid) 2887205253; (doi) 10.3390/bdcc2030020,en

Gardner; P. Mooney; S. De Sabbata; L. Dowthwaite,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>; <jats:p>This paper presents the results of an exploratory quantitative analysis of gendered contributions to the online mapping project OpenStreetMap (OSM), in which previous research has identified a strong male participation bias. On these grounds, theories of representation in volunteered geographic information (VGI) have argued that this kind of crowdsourced data fails to embody the geospatial interests of the wider community. The observed effects of the bias however, remain conspicuously absent from discourses of VGI and gender, which proceed with little sense of impact. This study addresses this void by analysing OSM contributions by gender and thus identifies differences in men’s and women’s mapping practices. An online survey uniquely captured the OSM IDs as well as the declared gender of 293 OSM users. Statistics relating to users’ editing and tagging behaviours openly accessible via the ‘how did you contribute to OSM’ wiki page were subsequently analysed. The results reveal that volumes of overall activity as well editing and tagging actions in OSM remain significantly dominated by men. They also indicate subtle but impactful differences in men’s and women’s preferences for modifying and creating data, as well as the tagging categories to which they contribute. Discourses of gender and ICT, gender relations in online VGI environments and competing motivational factors are implicated in these observations. As well as updating estimates of the gender participation bias in OSM, this paper aims to inform and stimulate subsequent discourses of gender and representation towards a new rationale for widening participation in VGI.</jats:p>",85,6,1603,1620,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10708-019-10035-z,10.1007/s10708-019-10035-z,,,0,000-754-835-429-245; 002-033-358-303-30X; 003-991-180-509-807; 004-784-430-672-741; 007-149-376-280-304; 008-655-662-451-459; 008-714-358-699-609; 012-649-655-761-647; 016-053-191-886-30X; 017-194-800-561-718; 018-149-318-770-531; 021-041-484-242-674; 022-990-663-378-930; 024-403-212-152-856; 026-219-167-680-926; 028-279-691-254-250; 028-707-326-304-991; 031-450-942-446-667; 034-259-873-982-477; 035-161-913-145-763; 044-295-844-689-731; 044-765-171-944-913; 045-231-924-208-508; 045-258-513-547-978; 047-068-085-985-722; 057-545-918-303-995; 059-842-118-804-12X; 066-101-498-522-68X; 066-652-233-253-956; 070-417-466-216-149; 071-516-807-119-516; 073-839-691-445-270; 088-726-168-316-873; 089-318-185-123-321; 100-866-038-545-202; 101-876-710-642-146; 106-264-944-278-433; 122-656-286-991-79X; 140-402-968-092-997; 144-999-465-771-314; 171-544-875-588-246; 175-225-651-992-60X,1,,(doi) 10.1007/s10708-019-10035-z,en

Camargo; Jonathan Bright; Graham McNeill; Sridhar Raman; Scott A. Hale,"Accurate understanding and forecasting of traffic is a key contemporary problem for policymakers. Road networks are increasingly congested, yet traffic data is often expensive to obtain, making informed policy-making harder. This paper explores the extent to which traffic disruption can be estimated using features from the volunteered geographic information site OpenStreetMap (OSM). We use OSM features as predictors for linear regressions of counts of traffic disruptions and traffic volume at 6,500 points in the road network within 112 regions of Oxfordshire, UK. We show that more than half the variation in traffic volume and disruptions can be explained with OSM features alone, and use cross-validation and recursive feature elimination to evaluate the predictive power and importance of different land use categories. Finally, we show that using OSM's granular point of interest data allows for better predictions than the broader categories typically used in studies of transportation and land use.",10,1,1271,,Recursion; Point of interest; Traffic volume; Transport engineering; Predictive power; Road networks; Computer science; Land use; Linear regression; Volunteered geographic information,,,,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31988334/ https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019arXiv190705162C/abstract https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-57882-2.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31988334 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1907.html#abs-1907-05162 http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-57882-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-57882-2,10.1038/s41598-020-57882-2,3001474901,PMC6985234,0,006-101-714-460-131; 007-052-221-075-524; 007-503-121-649-498; 013-445-037-365-411; 015-408-226-704-89X; 019-372-217-323-829; 020-132-620-861-048; 023-863-596-799-317; 024-619-305-888-806; 026-880-763-567-171; 027-108-336-376-082; 029-020-548-249-508; 029-029-002-740-224; 030-217-575-405-566; 031-931-488-038-539; 037-050-535-204-295; 038-976-596-179-447; 050-742-692-404-192; 056-077-921-386-807; 056-666-976-384-900; 060-288-645-112-192; 064-446-298-175-776; 073-480-282-116-582; 077-359-509-902-504; 085-802-160-396-381; 088-339-711-439-200; 095-660-474-996-103; 106-048-692-512-337; 113-070-923-635-401; 114-585-177-520-897; 122-480-812-989-491; 190-065-916-547-91X,4,,(pmcid) pmc6985234; (magid) 3001474901; (doi) 10.1038/s41598-020-57882-2; (pii) 10.1038/s41598-020-57882-2; (pmid) 31988334,en
052-201-779-099-005,The Countercultural Potential of Citizen Science,2014-10-12,2014,journal article,M/C Journal,14412616,Queensland University of Technology,,Daniel McQuillan,"<jats:p>What is the countercultural potential of citizen science? As a participant in the wider citizen science movement, I can attest that contemporary citizen science initiatives rarely characterise themselves as countercultural. Rather, the goal of most citizen science projects is to be seen as producing orthodox scientific knowledge: the ethos is respectability rather than rebellion (NERC). I will suggest instead that there are resonances with the counterculture that emerged in the 1960s, most visibly through an emphasis on participatory experimentation and the principles of environmental sustainability and social justice.   This will be illustrated by example, through two citizen science projects that have a commitment to combining social values with scientific practice. I will then describe the explicitly countercultural organisation, Science for the People, which arose from within the scientific community itself, out of opposition to the Vietnam War. Methodological and conceptual weaknesses in the authoritative model of science are explored, suggesting that there is an opportunity for citizen science to become anti-hegemonic by challenging the hegemony of science itself. This reformulation will be expressed through Deleuze and Guattari's notion of nomadic science, the means through which citizen science could become countercultural.   Counterculture   Before examining the countercultural potential of citizen science, I set out some of the grounds for identifying a counterculture drawing on the ideas of Theodore Roszak, who invented the term counterculture to describe the new forms of youth movements that emerged in the 1960s (Roszak). This was a perspective that allowed the carnivalesque procession of beatniks, hippies and the New Left to be seen as a single paradigm shift combining psychic and social revolution. But just as striking and more often forgotten is the way Roszak characterised the role of the counterculture as mobilising a vital critique of the scientific worldview (Roszak 273-274). The concept of counterculture has been taken up in diverse ways since its original formation. We can draw, for example, on Lawrence Grossberg's more contemporary analysis of counterculture (Grossberg) to clarify the main concepts and contrast them with a scientific approach.   Firstly, a counterculture works on and through cultural formations. This positions it as something the scientific community would see as the other, as the opposite to the objective, repeatable and quantitative truth-seeking of science. Secondly, a counterculture is a diverse and hybrid space without a unitary identity. Again, scientists would often see science as a singular activity applied in modulated forms depending on the context, although in practice the different sciences can experience each other as different tribes. Thirdly, a counterculture is lived as a transformative experience where the participant is fundamentally changed at a psychic level through participation in unique events. Contrast this with the scientific idea of the separation of observer and observed, and the objective repeatability of the experiment irrespective of the experimenter.   Fourthly, a counterculture is associated with a unique moment in time, a point of shift from the old to the new. For the counterculture of the 1960s this was the Age of Aquarius. In general, the aim of science and scientists is to contribute to a form of truth that is essentially timeless, in that a physical law is assumed to hold across all time (and space), although science also has moments of radical change with regard to scientific paradigms. Finally, and significantly for the conclusions of this paper, according to Roszak a counterculture stands against the mainstream. It offers a challenge not at the level of detail but, to the fundamental assumptions of the status quo. This is what “science” cannot do, in as much as science itself has become the mainstream.   It was the character of science as the bedrock of all values that Roszak himself opposed and for which he named and welcomed the counterculture. Although critical of some of the more shallow aspects of its psychedelic experimentation or political militancy, he shared its criticism of the technocratic society (the technocracy) and the egocentric mode of consciousness. His hope was that the counterculture could help restore a visionary imagination along with a more human sense of community.  What Is Citizen Science?  In recent years the concept of citizen science has grown massively in popularity, but is still an open and unstable term with many variants. Current moves towards institutionalisation (Citizen Science Association) are attempting to marry growth and stabilisation, with the first Annual General Meeting of the European Citizen Science Association securing a tentative agreement on the common principles of citizen science (Haklay, ""European"").   Key papers and presentations in the mainstream of the movement emphasise that citizen science is not a new activity (Bonney et al.) with much being made of the fact that the National Audubon Society started its annual Christmas Bird Count in 1900 (National Audubon Society). However, this elides the key role of the Internet in the current surge, which takes two distinct forms; the organisation of distributed fieldwork, and the online crowdsourcing of data analysis.   To scientists, the appeal of citizen science fieldwork follows from its distributed character; they can research patterns over large scales and across latitudes in ways that would be impossible for a researcher at a single study site (Toomey). Gathering together the volunteer, observations are made possible by an infrastructure of web tools. The role of the citizen in this is to be a careful observer; the eyes and ears of the scientist in cyberspace. In online crowdsourcing, the internet is used to present pattern recognition tasks; enrolling users in searching images for signs of new planets or the jets of material from black holes.   The growth of science crowdsourcing is exponential; one of the largest sites facilitating this kind of citizen science now has well in excess of a million registered users (Zooniverse). Such is the force of the technological aura around crowdsourced science that mainstream publications often conflate it with the whole of citizen science (Parr).  There are projects within citizen science which share core values with the counterculture as originally defined by Roszak, in particular open participation and social justice. These projects also show characteristics from Grossberg's analysis of counterculture; they are diverse and hybrid spaces, carry a sense of moving from an old era to a new one, and have cultural forms of their own. They open up the full range of the scientific method to participation, including problem definition, research design, analysis and action. Citizen science projects that aim for participation in all these areas include the Extreme Citizen Science research group (ExCiteS) at University College London (UCL), the associated social enterprise Mapping for Change (Mapping for Change), and the Public Laboratory for Open Technology and Science (Public Lab).  ExCiteS sees its version of citizen science as ""a situated, bottom-up practice"" that ""takes into account local needs, practices and culture"". Public Lab, meanwhile, argue that many citizen science projects only offer non-scientists token forms of participation in scientific inquiry that rarely amount to more that data collection and record keeping. They counter this through an open process which tries to involve communities all the way from framing the research questions, to prototyping tools, to collating and interpreting the measurements.   ExCiteS and Public Lab also share an implicit commitment to social justice through scientific activity. The Public Lab mission is to ""put scientific inquiry at the heart of civic life"" and the UCL research group strive for ""new devices and knowledge creation processes that can transform the world"". All of their work is framed by environmental sustainability and care for the planet, whether it's enabling environmental monitoring by indigenous communities in the Congo (ExCiteS) or developing do-it-yourself spectrometry kits to detect crude oil pollution (Public Lab, ""Homebrew""). Having provided a case for elements of countercultural DNA being present in bottom-up and problem-driven citizen science, we can contrast this with Science for the People, a scientific movement that was born out of the counterculture.   Countercultural Science from the 1970s: Science for the People  Science for the People (SftP) was a scientific movement seeded by a rebellion of young physicists against the role of US science in the Vietnam War. Young members of the American Physical Society (APS) lobbied for it to take a position against the war but were heavily criticised by other members, whose written complaints in the communications of the APS focused on the importance of scientific neutrality and the need to maintain the association's purely scientific nature rather than allowing science to become contaminated by politics (Sarah Bridger, in Plenary 2, 0:46 to 1:04).   The counter-narrative from the dissidents argued that science is not neutral, invoking the example of Nazi science as a justification for taking a stand. After losing the internal vote the young radicals left to form Scientists and Engineers for Social and Political Action (SESPA), which later became Science for the People (SftP). As well as opposition to the Vietnam War, SftP embodied from the start other key themes of the counterculture, such as civil rights and feminism. For example, the first edition of Science for the People magazine (appearing as Vol. 2, No. 2 of the SESPA Newsletter) included an article about leading Black Panther, Bobby Seale, alongside a piece entitled “Women Demand Equality in Science.”   The final articles in the same issue are indicators of SftP's dual approach to science and change; both the radicalisation of professionals (“Computer Professionals for Peace”) and the demystification of technical practices (“Statistics for the People”) (Science for the People). Science for the People was by no means just a magazine. For example, their technical assistance programme provided practical support to street health clinics run by the Black Panthers, and brought SftP under FBI surveillance (Herb Fox, in Plenary 1, 0:25 to 0:35).   Both as a magazine and as a movement, SftP showed a tenacious longevity, with the publication being produced every two months between August 1970 and May/June 1989. It mutated through a network of affiliated local groups and international links, and was deeply involved in constructing early critiques of nuclear power and genetic determinism.   SftP itself seems to have had a consistent commitment to non-hierarchical processes and, as one of the founders expressed it, a “shit kicking” approach to putting its principles in to practice (Al Weinrub, in Plenary 1, 0:25 to 0:35). SftP criticised power, front and centre. It is this opposition to hegemony that puts the “counter” into counterculture, and is missing from citizen science as currently practised.   Cracks in the authority of orthodox science, which can be traced to both methodologies and basic concepts, follow in this paper. These can be seen as an opportunity for citizen science to directly challenge orthodox science and thus establish an anti-hegemonic stance of its own.   Weaknesses of Scientific Hegemony  In this section I argue that the weaknesses of scientific hegemony are in proportion to its claims to authority (Feyerabend). Through my scientific training as an experimental particle physicist I have participated in many discussions about the ontological and epistemological grounds for scientific authority. While most scientists choose to present their practice publicly as an infallible machine for the production of truths, the opinions behind the curtain are far more mixed. Physicist Lee Somolin has written a devastating critique of science-in-practice that focuses on the capture of the institutional economy of science by an ideological grouping of string theorists (Smolin), and his account is replete with questions about science itself and ethnographic details that bring to life the messy behind-the-scenes conflicts in scientific-knowledge making.   Knowledge of this messiness has prompted some citizen science advocates to take science to task, for example for demanding higher standards in data consistency from citizen science than is often the case in orthodox science (Haklay, ""Assertions""; Freitag, ""Good Science""). Scientists will also and invariably refer to reproducibility as the basis for the authority of scientific truths. The principle that the same experiments always get the same results, irrespective of who is doing the experiment, and as long as they follow the same method, is a foundation of scientific objectivity.   However, a 2012 study of landmark results in cancer science was able to reproduce only 11 per cent of the original findings (Begley and Ellis). While this may be an outlier case, there are broader issues with statistics and falsification, a bias on positive results, weaknesses in peer review and the “publish or perish” academic culture (The Economist).   While the pressures are all-too-human, the resulting distortions are rarely acknowledged in public by scientists themselves. On the other hand, citizen science has been slow to pick up the gauntlet. For example, while some scientists involved in citizen science have commented on the inequality and inappropriateness of orthodox peer review for citizen science papers (Freitag, “What Is the Role”) there has been no direct challenge to any significant part of the scientific edifice.   I argue that the nearest thing to a real challenge to orthodox science is the proposal for a post-normal science, which pre-dates the current wave of citizen science. Post-normal science tries to accommodate the philosophical implications of post-structuralism and at the same time position science to tackle problems such as climate change, intractable to reproducibility (Funtowicz and Ravetz).   It accomplishes this by extending the domains in which science can provide meaningful answers to include issues such as global warming, which involve high decision stakes and high uncertainty. It extends traditional peer review into an extended peer community, which includes all the stakeholders in an issue, and may involve active research as well as quality assessment.   The idea of extended peer review has obvious overlaps with community-oriented citizen science, but has yet to be widely mobilised as a theoretical buttress for citizen-led science. Prior even to post-normal science are the potential cracks in the core philosophy of science. In her book Cosmopolitics, Isabelle Stengers characterises the essential nature of scientific truth as the ability to disqualify and exclude other truth claims. This, she asserts, is the hegemony of physics and its singular claim to decide what is real and what is true.   Stengers traces this, in part, to the confrontation more than one hundred years ago between Max Planck and Ernst Mach, whereas the latter argued that claims to an absolute truth should be replaced by formulations that tied physical laws to the human practices that produced them. Planck stood firmly for knowledge forms that were unbounded by time, space or specific social-material procedures (Stengers). Although contemporary understandings of science are based on Planck's version, citizen science has the potential to re-open these questions in a productive manner for its own practices, if it can re-conceive of itself as what Deleuze and Guattari would call nomadic science (Deleuze; Deleuze &amp; Guattari).   Citizen Science as Nomadic Science  Deleuze and Guattari referred to orthodox science as Royal Science or Striated Science, referring in part to its state-like form of authority and practice, as well as its psycho-social character. Their alternative is a smooth or nomadic science that, importantly for citizen science, does not have the ambition to totalise knowledge.   Nomadic science is a form of empirical investigation that has no need to be hooked up to a grand narrative. The concept of nomadic science is a natural fit for bottom-up citizen science because it can valorise truths that are non-dual and that go beyond objectivity to include the experiential. In this sense it is like the extended peer review of post-normal science but without the need to be limited to high-risk high-stakes questions. As there is no a priori problem with provisional knowledges, it naturally inclines towards the local, the situated and the culturally reflective. The apparent unreliability of citizen science in terms of participants and tools, which is solely a source of anxiety, can become heuristic for nomadic science when re-cast through the forgotten alternatives like Mach's formulation; that truths are never separated from the specifics of the context and process that produced them (Stengers 6-18; 223).   Nomadic science, I believe, will start to emerge through projects that are prepared to tackle toxic epistemology as much as toxic pollutants. For example, the Community Based Auditing (CBA) developed by environmental activists in Tasmania (Tattersall) challenges local alliances of state and extractive industries by undermining their own truth claims with regards to environmental impact, a process described in the CBA Toolbox as disconfirmation. In CBA, this mixture of post-normal science and Stenger's critique is combined with forms of data collection and analysis known as Community Based Sampling (Tattersall et al.), which would be recognisable to any citizen science project.   The change from citizen science to nomadic science is not a total rupture but a shift in the starting point: it is based on an overt critique of power. One way to bring this about is being tested in the “Kosovo Science for Change” project (Science for Change Kosovo), where I am a researcher and where we have adopted the critical pedagogy of Paulo Freire as the starting point for our empirical investigations (Freire). Critical pedagogy is learning as the co-operative activity of understanding—how our lived experience is constructed by power, and how to make a difference in the world. Taking a position such as nomadic science, openly critical of Royal Science, is the anti-hegemonic stance that could qualify citizen science as properly countercultural.  Citizen Science and Counterculture  Counterculture, as I have expressed it, stands against or rejects the hegemonic culture. However, there is a strong tendency in contemporary social movements to take a stance not only against the dominant structures but against hegemony itself. They contest what Richard Day calls the hegemony of hegemony (Day).   I witnessed this during the counter-G8 mobilisation of 2001. Having been an activist in the 1980s and 1990s I was wearily familiar with the sectarian competitiveness of various radical narratives, each seeking to establish itself as the correct path. So it was a strongly affective experience to stand in the convergence centre and listen to so many divergent social groups and movements agree to support each other's tactics, expressing a solidarity based on a non-judgemental pluralism. Since then we have seen the emergence of similarly anti-hegemonic countercultures around the Occupy and Anonymous movements. It is in this context of counterculture that I will try to summarise and evaluate the countercultural potential of citizen science and what being countercultural might offer to citizen science itself.   To be countercultural it is not enough for citizen science to counterpose participation against the institutional and hierarchical aspects of professional science. As an activity defined purely by engagement it offers to plug the legitimacy gap for science while still being wholly dependent on it. A countercultural citizen science must pose a strong challenge to the status quo, and I have suggested that a route to this would be to develop as nomadic science. This does not mean replacing or overthrowing science but constructing an other to science with its own claim to empirical methods. It is fair to ask what this would offer citizen science that it does not already have. At an abstract level it would gain a freedom of movement; an ability to occupy Deleuzian smooth spaces rather than be constrained by the striation of established science.   The founders of Science for the People are clear that it could never have existed if it had not been able to draw on the mass movements of its time. Being countercultural would give citizen science an affinity with the bottom-up, local and community-based issues where empirical methods are likely to have the most social impact.   One of many examples is the movement against fracking (the hydraulic fracturing of deep rock formations to release shale gas). Together, these benefits of being countercultural open up the possibility for forms of citizen science to spread rhizomatically in a way that is not about immaterial virtual labour but is itself part of a wider cultural change. The possibility of a nomadic science stands as a doorway to the change that Roszak saw at the heart of the counterculture, a renewal of the visionary imagination.  References  Begley, C.

This paper presents the concept of Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) as an integral part of future inclusive services. By utilising crowd-sourced data, services can become more efficient, intuitive and relevant for a wider population than previously possible.

In 1970, the Institute of Geography of the University of; Bern initiated the phenological observation network BernClim. Seasonality; information from plants, fog and snow was originally available for applications in; urban and regional planning and agricultural and touristic suitability and is; now a valuable data set for climate change impact studies. Covering the; growing season, volunteer observers record the dates of key development; stages of hazel (Corylus avellana), dandelion (Taraxacum officinale), apple; tree (Pyrus malus) and beech (Fagus sylvatica). All observations consist of; detailed site information, including location, altitude, exposition (aspect); and inclination, that makes BernClim unique in its richness in detail on decadal; timescales. Quality control (QC) by experts and statistical analyses of the; data have been performed to flag impossible dates, dates outside the; biologically plausible range, repeated dates in the same year, stretches of; consecutive identical dates and statistically inconsistent dates (outliers; in time or in space). Here, we report BernClim data of 7414 plant; phenological observations from 1970 to 2018 from 1304 sites at 110 stations, the QC procedure and selected applications (Rutishauser et al., 2019: https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.900102 ). The QC points to very good; internal consistency (only 0.2 % were flagged as internally inconsistent) and likely high quality of the data. BernClim data indicate a trend towards an extended growing season. They also track the regime shift in the late 1980s well to pronounced earlier dates like numerous other phenological records across the Northern Hemisphere.",11,4,1645,1654,Physical geography; Seasonality; Climate change; Growing season; Geography; Beech; Fagus sylvatica; Altitude; Apple tree; Phenology,,,,,https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.900102 https://www.earth-syst-sci-data.net/11/1645/2019/ https://boris.unibe.ch/131698/ https://noa.gwlb.de/receive/cop_mods_00040704 https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/11/1645/2019/ https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/11/1645/2019/essd-11-1645-2019.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/essd-11-1645-2019,10.5194/essd-11-1645-2019,2950179607,,0,005-140-326-019-235; 009-482-880-163-256; 015-101-584-755-308; 017-048-038-914-685; 018-289-169-447-128; 024-421-722-979-369; 025-520-322-969-903; 025-826-287-858-651; 037-374-163-144-738; 049-136-928-531-484; 053-597-750-015-63X; 061-624-390-942-94X; 082-574-247-704-681; 083-343-893-611-103; 117-171-068-240-692; 139-430-618-628-23X; 195-193-967-192-598,1,,(magid) 2950179607; (doi) 10.5194/essd-11-1645-2019,en

Rosemartin; Katharine L. Gerst; Jake F. Weltzin,"Recent improvements in online information communication and mobile location-aware technologies have led to the production of large volumes of volunteered geographic information. Widespread, large-scale efforts by volunteers to collect data can inform and drive scientific advances in diverse fields, including ecology and climatology. Traditional workflows to check the quality of such volunteered information can be costly and time consuming as they heavily rely on human interventions. However, identifying factors that can influence data quality, such as inconsistency, is crucial when these data are used in modeling and decision-making frameworks. Recently developed workflows use simple statistical approaches that assume that the majority of the information is consistent. However, this assumption is not generalizable, and ignores underlying geographic and environmental contextual variability that may explain apparent inconsistencies. Here we describe an automated workflow to check inconsistency based on the availability of contextual environmental information for sampling locations. The workflow consists of three steps: (1) dimensionality reduction to facilitate further analysis and interpretation of results, (2) model-based clustering to group observations according to their contextual conditions, and (3) identification of inconsistent observations within each cluster. The workflow was applied to volunteered observations of flowering in common and cloned lilac plants (Syringa vulgaris and Syringa x chinensis) in the United States for the period 1980 to 2013. About 97% of the observations for both common and cloned lilacs were flagged as consistent, indicating that volunteers provided reliable information for this case study. Relative to the original dataset, the exclusion of inconsistent observations changed the apparent rate of change in lilac bloom dates by two days per decade, indicating the importance of inconsistency checking as a key step in data quality assessment for volunteered geographic information. Initiatives that leverage volunteered geographic information can adapt this workflow to improve the quality of their datasets and the robustness of their scientific analyses.",10,10,140811,,Geoinformatics; Data visualization; Workflow; Data quality; Data science; Volunteered geographic information; Bioinformatics; Dimensionality reduction; Cluster analysis; Biology; Sampling (statistics),,Algorithms; Cluster Analysis; Data Accuracy; Environment; United States; Workflow,,,http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0140811 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015PLoSO..1040811M/abstract https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26485157 https://paperity.org/p/74296760/developing-a-workflow-to-identify-inconsistencies-in-volunteered-geographic-information-a https://core.ac.uk/display/92558019 https://arizona.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/developing-a-workflow-to-identify-inconsistencies-in-volunteered- https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0140811 https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70159427 https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/PMC4618855 https://research.utwente.nl/en/publications/developing-a-workflow-to-identify-inconsistencies-in-volunteered- https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Aris.utwente.nl%3Apublications%2F80d99ac6-0891-44fe-8095-c997e76e651e,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0140811,10.1371/journal.pone.0140811,1846707281,PMC4618855,0,002-978-775-225-739; 006-020-317-080-640; 006-624-487-268-707; 008-352-980-171-366; 008-976-078-444-281; 010-436-855-495-142; 010-904-178-957-577; 012-542-522-483-858; 012-742-769-460-136; 014-536-793-657-604; 015-063-175-189-638; 015-101-584-755-308; 015-678-344-819-698; 016-590-693-609-330; 023-479-488-890-096; 024-723-379-221-772; 025-847-175-638-067; 026-256-495-228-931; 027-736-997-184-595; 029-340-960-234-28X; 029-821-149-312-872; 031-899-200-118-496; 038-484-162-722-261; 040-267-517-107-219; 043-652-160-518-655; 046-026-102-253-397; 047-100-212-874-054; 053-620-292-475-147; 057-545-918-303-995; 064-287-901-698-702; 064-325-446-233-173; 068-147-889-206-824; 072-243-912-426-29X; 073-459-865-380-004; 075-110-583-299-364; 075-490-705-402-567; 077-402-637-308-519; 084-342-782-933-902; 085-952-781-110-685; 096-166-001-995-63X; 097-612-174-011-049; 100-635-968-014-055; 102-356-905-335-178; 106-362-555-436-687; 117-392-548-043-830; 118-419-615-998-48X; 119-356-314-019-189; 119-499-697-137-614; 130-700-123-619-585; 134-032-121-295-112; 135-360-535-210-851; 138-673-529-421-480; 143-816-305-815-241; 153-639-024-781-899; 163-902-715-686-434; 169-004-007-623-620; 171-544-875-588-246; 188-678-650-340-531,19,"research support, non-u.s. gov't",(pmcid) pmc4618855; (pmid) 26485157; (pii) pone-d-15-17611; (coreid) 92558019; (doi) 10.1371/journal.pone.0140811; (magid) 1846707281,en

Effectively mitigating air pollution in urban areas necessitates accurate air quality exposure information. Recent advancements in sensor technology and the increasing popularity of volunteered geographic information (VGI) open up new possibilities for air quality exposure assessment in cities. However, citizens and their sensors are put in areas deemed to be subjectively of interest (e.g., where citizens live, school of their kids or working spaces), and this leads to missed opportunities when it comes to optimal air quality exposure assessment. In addition, while the current literature on VGI has extensively discussed data quality and citizen engagement issues, few works, if any, offer techniques to fine-tune VGI contributions for an optimal air quality exposure assessment. This article presents and tests an approach to minimise land use regression prediction errors on citizen-contributed data. The approach was evaluated using a dataset (N = 116 sensors) from the city of Stuttgart, Germany. The comparison between the existing network design and the combination of locations selected by the optimisation method has shown a drop in spatial mean prediction error by 52%. The ideas presented in this article are useful for the systematic deployment of VGI air quality sensors, and can aid in the creation of higher resolution, more realistic maps for air quality monitoring in cities.</jats:p>",7,12,468,,Software deployment; Air quality index; Exposure assessment; Transport engineering; Data quality; Popularity; Computer science; Air pollution; Volunteered geographic information; Crowdsourcing,,,,,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018IJGI....7..468G/abstract https://run.unl.pt/bitstream/10362/61648/1/SGupta_EPebesma_ADegbelo_ACCosta_2018.pdf https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/7/12/468 https://run.unl.pt/handle/10362/61648 https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi7120468 https://novaresearch.unl.pt/en/publications/optimising-citizen-driven-air-quality-monitoring-networks-for-cit https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ijgi/ijgi7.html#GuptaPDC18,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi7120468,10.3390/ijgi7120468,2902404791,,0,000-760-066-466-404; 001-930-387-268-471; 005-544-646-390-165; 006-878-054-090-464; 007-684-128-166-136; 008-655-662-451-459; 011-268-109-088-314; 012-654-416-190-003; 013-349-571-215-560; 014-728-060-777-322; 014-881-705-112-653; 019-755-756-580-857; 020-132-620-861-048; 022-731-432-318-109; 022-871-582-053-876; 022-929-362-950-881; 023-674-829-642-546; 030-364-691-709-487; 031-116-113-990-880; 032-146-267-618-794; 033-648-762-703-044; 038-918-301-258-557; 038-976-596-179-447; 040-654-371-575-326; 043-976-629-549-119; 045-118-202-479-74X; 047-833-007-161-424; 049-911-115-671-935; 050-639-526-736-188; 051-754-034-422-940; 056-824-658-349-801; 058-142-173-467-409; 065-737-457-383-414; 066-819-591-703-12X; 068-402-228-133-117; 072-462-802-963-000; 072-677-608-018-409; 076-452-151-364-763; 077-238-781-120-797; 084-630-670-678-464; 091-548-517-603-379; 094-531-145-686-043; 097-612-174-011-049; 100-900-774-899-216; 106-907-202-837-351; 115-357-742-026-253; 117-903-500-257-09X; 119-156-989-154-761; 122-283-726-916-031; 148-230-422-979-361; 151-958-568-644-134,2,,(doi) 10.3390/ijgi7120468; (magid) 2902404791,en

The phenomenon itself, however, remains poorly understood. To study the connection between PSC and classical meridians, we applied a geographic information system (GIS) to analyze sketches of acupuncture sensations from healthy volunteers after laser acupuncture. As PSC can be subtle, we aimed at reducing the confounding impact of external stimuli by carrying out the experiment in a floatation tank under restricted environmental stimulation. 82.4% of the subjects experienced PSC, that is, they had line-like or 2-dimensional sensations, although there were some doubts that these were related to the laser stimulation. Line-like sensations on the same limb were averaged to calculate sensation mean courses, which were then compared to classical meridians by measuring the mean distance between the two. Distances ranged from 0.83 cm in the case of the heart (HT) and spleen (SP) meridian to 6.27 cm in the case of the kidney (KI) meridian. Furthermore, PSC was observed to ""jump"" between adjacent meridians. In summary, GIS has proven to be a valuable tool to study PSC, and our results suggest a close connection between PSC and classical meridians.",2012,,591304,591304,Sensation; Pathology; Stimulus (physiology); Meridian (astronomy); Sensory deprivation; Laser Acupuncture; Basic research; Healthy volunteers; Audiology; Acupuncture; Medicine,,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23243458 https://www.scienceopen.com/document?vid=e0f65181-c07e-4bfc-a794-ac1b7bbe817c http://publikationen.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/frontdoor/index/index/docId/29450 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3518766 http://www.sowen.it/studi/studenti/download.asp?nome_file=acupuncture+sensation+patterns.pdf&livello=livello1&id=1/&url=utenti/livello1/acupuncture+sensation+patterns.pdf https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2012/591304.pdf https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2012/591304/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2012/591304,10.1155/2012/591304,2152676175,PMC3518766,0,006-526-678-536-824; 008-593-727-407-045; 015-510-319-016-958; 016-163-994-340-965; 016-757-818-595-721; 018-969-442-650-506; 020-308-799-570-115; 023-475-284-890-029; 027-528-089-076-111; 027-534-963-374-053; 027-745-576-165-286; 029-040-658-925-00X; 034-182-559-682-289; 038-736-358-804-873; 043-425-823-263-80X; 048-698-656-957-382; 064-091-513-279-974; 064-933-203-345-284; 074-607-091-712-359; 078-735-436-538-686; 089-852-526-978-732; 091-526-532-657-706; 121-828-331-136-138,25,,(doi) 10.1155/2012/591304; (pmid) 23243458; (magid) 2152676175; (pmcid) pmc3518766,en

Fletcher; John P. Hirdes,"Background: fear of falling may lead to avoidance of activities for seniors, even though they may be able to perform these activities. SpeciWc risk factors for fear of falling that are amenable to change among various populations have been identiWed within the literature; however, detailed information about the risk factors for fear of falling, speciWcally among communitybased seniors receiving home care services, is limited. Objective: the aim of this cross-sectional study was to examine the factors associated with restriction of activity resulting from fear of falling among 2,300 seniors receiving home care services. Participants: all participants (n = 2,304) in this study were receiving home care services between 1999 and 2001 from a sample of 10 volunteering community-based agencies (Community Care Access Centres) representing the major geographic regions of Ontario, Canada. Community care access centres act as gatekeeping organisations assessing need and contracting out for a broad range of community-based services. Measurements: the Minimum Data Set for Home Care, a comprehensive and standardised assessment tool used to evaluate the needs and ability levels of older adults utilising home care services, covers several key domains, such as service use, function, health and social support. Nurses trained to administer the Minimum Data Set for Home Care assessed each of the participants within their homes. Results: of the 2,304 seniors within the study, 41.2% of participants expressed they restricted their activity for fear of falling. Percentages reporting fear of falling within the literature are considerably lower than the present Wndings, and probably attributable to the frailer, home care population within the present study. In the Wnal logistic regression model, being female, having various impairments/limitations, lack of support and being a multiple faller signiWcantly increased risk of fear of falling, whereas individuals that used antipsychotics and individuals that had Alzheimer’s disease were less likely to report restricting their activity. Conclusions: the results from this study provide information about a group void in the literature pertaining to activity restriction from fear of falling – community-based seniors receiving home care services. The comprehensive nature of the Minimum Data Set for Home Care allowed for a myriad of factors to be assessed and subsequently analysed with respect to the outcome variable. The inclusion of items on falls, fear of falling, and risk factors for both adverse outcomes means that home care professionals using this instrument will have a unique opportunity to identify and respond to problems that have an important impact on the client’s quality of life.",33,3,273,279,Quality of life; Logistic regression; Social support; Minimum Data Set; Disease; Fear of falling; Population; Medicine; Gatekeeping; Gerontology,,"Accidental Falls; Age Distribution; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aging/physiology; Fear; Female; Frail Elderly; Home Care Services; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Motor Activity; Ontario/epidemiology; Risk Factors",,,https://academic.oup.com/ageing/article-pdf/33/3/273/49312/afh077.pdf https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Paula_Fletcher/publication/8621643_Restriction_in_activity_associated_with_fear_of_falling_among_community-based_seniors_using_home_care_services/links/00b7d5149b2f16f70e000000.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15082433,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ageing/afh077,10.1093/ageing/afh077,2137568193,,0,007-122-486-239-492; 007-773-232-007-375; 009-121-228-103-312; 009-439-272-337-44X; 009-905-813-427-751; 011-160-507-652-73X; 011-246-012-807-231; 012-318-809-200-564; 012-632-494-297-933; 014-525-152-452-699; 015-765-990-999-983; 023-321-319-964-103; 033-004-154-548-497; 037-821-396-012-519; 039-281-852-338-159; 041-861-433-495-443; 043-418-961-017-839; 047-470-281-673-625; 064-606-088-641-521; 067-089-087-739-443; 071-261-844-541-546; 075-857-836-482-737; 084-476-871-275-335; 092-582-117-946-79X; 094-194-289-010-398; 117-278-242-183-030; 131-935-542-230-403; 140-502-138-551-152; 148-595-854-336-37X; 189-286-841-659-071,258,"research support, non-u.s. gov't",(doi) 10.1093/ageing/afh077; (pmid) 15082433; (magid) 2137568193; (pii) 33/3/273,en

B. van Wamel; Hubert P. Endtz; Alex van Belkum; Manfred Kayser,"Human fingertip microflora is transferred to touched objects and may provide forensically relevant information on individual hosts, such as on geographic origins, if endogenous microbial skin species/strains would be retrievable from physical fingerprints and would carry geographically restricted DNA diversity. We tested the suitability of physical fingerprints for revealing human host information, with geographic inference as example, via microbial DNA fingerprinting. We showed that the transient exogenous fingertip microflora is frequently different from the resident endogenous bacteria of the same individuals. In only 54% of the experiments, the DNA analysis of the transient fingertip microflora allowed the detection of defined, but often not the major, elements of the resident microflora. Although we found microbial persistency in certain individuals, time-wise variation of transient and resident microflora within individuals was also observed when resampling fingerprints after 3 weeks. While microbial species differed considerably in their frequency spectrum between fingerprint samples from volunteers in Europe and southern Asia, there was no clear geographic distinction between Staphylococcus strains in a cluster analysis, although bacterial genotypes did not overlap between both continental regions. Our results, though limited in quantity, clearly demonstrate that the dynamic fingerprint microflora challenges human host inferences for forensic purposes including geographic ones. Overall, our results suggest that human fingerprint microflora is too dynamic to allow for forensic marker developments for retrieving human information.",124,5,477,481,Frequency spectrum; Ecology; Fingerprint; Colonization; Microbial DNA; Relevant information; Evolutionary biology; DNA profiling; Biology,,"Bangladesh; DNA Fingerprinting; DNA, Bacterial/genetics; Dermatoglyphics; Electrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field; Fingers/microbiology; Genotype; Humans; Netherlands; Skin/microbiology","DNA, Bacterial",,https://core.ac.uk/display/19195820 https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hubert_Endtz/publication/26315820_Microbial_DNA_fingerprinting_of_human_fingerprints_dynamic_colonization_of_fingertip_microflora_challenges_human_host_inferences_for_forensic_purposes/links/0c960516c5613c32ef000000.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2955242/ http://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/wurpubs/380956 https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai:repub.eur.nl:26951 https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00414-009-0352-9 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs00414-009-0352-9.pdf https://paperity.org/p/28278610/microbial-dna-fingerprinting-of-human-fingerprints-dynamic-colonization-of-fingertip https://doi.org/10.1007%2Fs00414-009-0352-9 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00414-009-0352-9 https://repub.eur.nl/pub/26951/ http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC2955242,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00414-009-0352-9,10.1007/s00414-009-0352-9,2120781473,PMC2955242,0,001-274-190-618-623; 001-340-424-093-608; 008-073-937-260-601; 008-561-172-289-56X; 012-631-695-599-722; 018-363-945-602-358; 020-172-048-751-53X; 026-381-438-579-447; 028-854-200-410-158; 029-135-087-125-878; 039-111-442-175-148; 043-247-930-468-609; 048-973-792-755-332; 054-423-320-985-392; 069-120-017-542-835; 077-505-688-131-938; 077-817-374-399-643; 084-923-253-908-475; 088-399-566-644-148; 095-202-195-115-758; 108-047-101-862-481; 119-943-100-258-324; 180-188-401-949-642,20,"research support, non-u.s. gov't",(magid) 2120781473; (pmcid) pmc2955242; (doi) 10.1007/s00414-009-0352-9; (coreid) 19195820; (pmid) 19551400,en

Morgan,"Abstract. In the last number of years there has been increased interest from researchers in investigating and understanding the characteristics and backgrounds of citizens who contribute to Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) and Citizen Science (CS) projects. Much of the reluctance from stakeholders such as National Mapping Agencies, Environmental Ministries, etc. to use data and information generated and collected by VGI and CS projects grows from the lack of knowledge and understanding about who these contributors are. As they are drawn from the crowd there is a sense of the unknown about these citizens. Subsequently there are justifiable concerns about these citizens’ ability to collect, generate and manage high quality and accurate spatial, scientific and environmental data and information.

Malini,"<AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"" NlmCategory=""BACKGROUND"">India is characterized by the presence of a large number of endogamous castes, tribes and religions, having second largest concentration of tribal population in the World with differed genetic ethnicity, lifestyle and environmental habitat from those of mainstream population. Lack of data is constraint when it comes to tracking the tribal population health status, specifically reproductive health aspects by experimental approaches. The male fertility impairment depends on Y chromosome azoospermia factor c (AZFc) subdeletions, which varies highly in different geographical populations and in an Indian admixed population the frequency and effect of deletion on fertility is relatively poorly documented. Therefore, the current study has been initiated to enumerate and characterize the strength of association between Yq11 AZFc subdeletions and fertility impairment among Siddi tribal men of Western Ghats, India.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">Here, using predesigned performa we collected personal as well as familial information of 200 volunteered male subjects and grouped them into: (i) 104 married individuals with proven fertility, and (ii) 96 unmarried men with unknown fertility status. Quantification of reproductive hormones such as follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), leutinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone were studied. Oxidative stress markers like total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and super oxide dismutase (SOD) along with analysis of five sequence tagged site (STS) hotspot markers were employed for mapping of Y chromosome AZFc subdeletions. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">Hormonal analysis and estimation of oxidative stress markers showed normal values with no significant differences between two subgroups. However, the Y chromosome AZFc subdeletion mapping revealed evident results as an individual displayed absence of STS sY1191 marker indicating b2/b3 deletion, whereas rest of the subjects exhibited no deletion for all the five STS markers. While, the individual has fathered two children, at this point it is difficult to draw a causal link between the observed deletion and its effect on fertility.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Thus, our current study suggests that the association between AZFc subdeletions with its effect on infertility varies highly in this study cohort compared to other Indian ethnic groups, exhibiting lower risk factor and non-association reaching insignificance among Siddi tribal men.</AbstractText>",25,1,1,10,Demography; Azoospermia factor; Male infertility; Infertility; Y chromosome; Population; Super oxide dismutase; Fertility; Genetics; Cohort; Biology,Ethnicity; Male infertility; Siddi tribe; Subdeletions; Y chromosome,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25901288 https://bacandrology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12610-014-0017-5 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4404687 https://paperity.org/p/59014225/impact-of-y-chromosome-azfc-subdeletion-shows-lower-risk-of-fertility-impairment-in-siddi https://bacandrology.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12610-014-0017-5?site=bacandrology.biomedcentral.com https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12610-014-0017-5 https://core.ac.uk/display/81718281 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81718281.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12610-014-0017-5,10.1186/s12610-014-0017-5,2128695130,PMC4404687,0,003-563-395-534-451; 004-051-101-753-956; 005-722-463-965-56X; 006-109-232-867-20X; 006-640-218-980-114; 009-176-627-113-591; 010-704-956-172-412; 010-929-542-239-653; 013-659-599-395-392; 014-687-498-007-033; 019-409-543-910-945; 020-021-228-262-84X; 021-019-066-019-540; 022-782-862-586-39X; 025-027-607-884-365; 028-376-531-867-570; 030-308-062-239-236; 031-349-930-094-290; 032-418-937-781-360; 033-344-663-229-145; 035-283-426-888-055; 036-449-444-873-790; 037-355-698-843-419; 040-220-354-545-207; 044-914-230-754-48X; 045-156-186-840-941; 045-785-415-504-493; 049-822-061-947-160; 052-088-387-793-573; 052-991-549-285-303; 053-427-000-411-009; 059-146-385-933-63X; 059-165-659-457-41X; 062-302-376-675-376; 067-520-760-852-768; 070-022-197-649-66X; 073-089-459-731-23X; 076-734-728-279-05X; 078-205-707-395-907; 080-051-952-913-467; 080-083-648-648-810; 082-798-902-963-974; 086-055-652-412-405; 090-937-450-332-182; 093-209-796-004-980; 094-927-359-211-490; 104-299-806-825-766; 106-949-387-313-436; 111-140-430-283-442; 111-279-753-112-046; 113-681-227-350-974; 119-129-611-574-381; 125-732-005-449-015; 126-326-443-014-84X; 134-121-515-479-461; 134-915-772-378-244; 153-377-813-278-586; 166-487-621-401-550; 170-371-811-512-673; 188-867-586-103-904; 195-550-583-132-29X,5,,(magid) 2128695130; (pmcid) pmc4404687; (pii) 17; (doi) 10.1186/s12610-014-0017-5; (coreid) 81718281; (pmid) 25901288,en

In this work, we specifically consider the problem of geospatial information extraction and representation, where one can exploit diverse sources of information (such as image and audio data, text data, etc), going beyond traditional volunteered geographic information. Our ambition is to include available narrative information in an effort to better explain geospatial relationships: with spatial reasoning being a basic form of human cognition, narratives expressing such experiences typically contain qualitative spatial data, i.e., spatial objects and spatial relationships. ; To this end, we formulate a quantitative approach for the representation of qualitative spatial relations extracted from UGC in the form of texts. The proposed method quantifies such relations based on multiple text observations. Such observations provide distance and orientation features which are utilized by a greedy Expectation Maximization-based (EM) algorithm to infer a probability distribution over predefined spatial relationships; the latter represent the quantified relationships under user-defined probabilistic assumptions. We evaluate the applicability and quality of the proposed approach using real UGC data originating from an actual travel blog text corpus. To verify the quality of the result, we generate grid-based maps visualizing the spatial extent of the various relations.",,,71,78,Spatial intelligence; Spatial analysis; Grid; Information retrieval; Text corpus; Spatial relation; Computer science; Probabilistic logic; Volunteered geographic information; Geospatial analysis; Data mining; Spatial intelligence; Spatial analysis; Grid; Spatial database; Spatial relation; Computer science; Probabilistic logic; Volunteered geographic information; Geospatial analysis,,,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.5204 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013arXiv1311.5204S/abstract https://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.5204.pdf http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.5204,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2534732.2534742,10.1145/2534732.2534742,3105588589; 2138825248,,0,002-978-775-225-739; 007-512-146-614-819; 007-970-670-861-523; 010-469-621-923-010; 015-063-175-189-638; 019-552-813-138-572; 024-879-652-427-626; 039-336-463-223-740; 040-123-867-943-476; 046-301-337-074-792; 047-349-555-344-403; 048-617-708-041-425; 049-767-961-875-693; 058-613-634-378-838; 063-765-123-517-027; 084-492-557-652-999; 088-443-155-927-050; 088-571-682-364-508; 089-611-265-795-438; 091-120-199-665-664; 097-466-542-149-672; 098-482-990-302-833; 102-124-274-700-075; 124-987-846-390-634; 127-121-257-725-477; 127-301-780-466-834; 130-299-344-667-304; 138-443-999-333-799; 142-743-007-431-871; 145-148-992-397-257; 147-516-912-068-269; 152-244-485-064-355; 166-910-784-564-122; 197-424-011-697-784,12,repository,(doi) 10.1145/2534732.2534742; (magid) 3105588589; (magid) 2138825248; (coreid) 24980952,en

As with all VGI, however, there is uncertainty concerning data quality and fitness-for-use. Currently, the task of evaluating fitness-for-use of POI is left to the data user, with no guidance framework being available which is why this research proposes a generic approach to choose appropriate measures for assessing fitness-for-use of crowdsourced POI for different tasks. (2) Methods: POI are related to the higher-level concept of geo-atoms in order to identify and distinguish their two basic functions, geo-referencing and object-referencing. Then, for each of these functions, suitable measures of positional and thematic quality are developed based on existing quality indicators. (3) Results: Typical use cases of POI are evaluated with regards to their use of the two basic functions of POI, and allocated appropriate measures for fitness-for-use. The general procedure is illustrated on a brief practical example. (4) Conclusion: This research addresses the issue of fitness-for-use of POI on a higher conceptual level by relating it to more fundamental notions of geographical information representation. The results are expected to assist users of crowdsourced POI datasets in determining an appropriate method to evaluate fitness-for-use",5,9,149,,World Wide Web; Point of interest; Geography; Information retrieval; Data quality; Information representation; Conceptual level; Use case; Volunteered geographic information; Thematic map,,,,,http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016IJGI....5..149J/abstract https://core.ac.uk/display/89313675 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ijgi/ijgi5.html#JonietzZ16 https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi5090149 https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi5090149 https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/5/9/149/pdf https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/5/9/149,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi5090149,10.3390/ijgi5090149,2515934971,,0,003-812-086-971-695; 013-516-235-069-82X; 014-818-480-999-908; 015-108-836-970-103; 017-008-646-646-77X; 019-126-880-210-368; 020-132-620-861-048; 023-686-029-571-733; 027-108-336-376-082; 029-963-409-674-751; 029-965-425-507-24X; 030-217-575-405-566; 030-416-570-557-01X; 030-975-962-975-895; 037-643-751-932-944; 038-976-596-179-447; 039-499-260-186-536; 040-267-517-107-219; 041-722-088-664-946; 044-801-465-338-965; 048-400-414-195-536; 068-749-131-980-38X; 072-399-891-869-702; 077-168-921-821-421; 084-229-520-705-235; 084-271-557-767-164; 086-758-442-428-039; 088-339-711-439-200; 094-792-785-337-138; 103-859-285-040-344; 112-325-364-706-730; 131-202-499-073-829; 134-461-535-456-989; 158-847-532-778-731; 171-544-875-588-246; 172-982-172-812-105; 185-700-850-296-212; 188-036-379-826-379,18,,(doi) 10.3390/ijgi5090149; (magid) 2515934971; (coreid) 89313675,en

Goodchild,"In recent months there has been an explosion of interest in using the Web to create, assemble, and disseminate geographic information provided voluntarily by individuals. Sites such as Wikimapia and OpenStreetMap are empowering citizens to create a global patchwork of geographic information, while Google Earth and other virtual globes are encouraging volunteers to develop inter- esting applications using their own data.

It helps to determine many community-based projects by identifying the material to be digitally maintained in multimedia collections provided by communities of volunteers, rather than for-profit businesses or government entities. Considering that the search and browsing of texts, images, video, and 3D models related to places is more essential than using a simple text-based search, an interactive multimedia map was implemented in this study. The map, which is loaded on a single HyperText Markup Language (HTML) page using AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML), with a client-side control mechanism utilising jQuery components that are both freely available and ad-hoc developed, is updated according to user interaction. To simplify the publication of geo-referenced information, the application stores all the data in a Geographic JavaScript Object Notation (GeoJSON) file rather than in a database. The multimedia contents—associated with the selected Points of Interest (PoIs)—can be selected through text search and list browsing as well as by viewing their previews one by one in a sequence all together in a scrolling window (respectively: “Table”, “Folder”, and “Tile” functions). PoIs—visualised on the map with multi-shape markers using a set of unambiguous colours—can be filtered through their categories and types, accessibility status and timeline, thus improving the system usability. The map functions are illustrated using data collected in a Comenius project.

057-773-748-599-619,Quantifying urban areas with multi-source data based on percolation theory,,2020,journal article,Remote Sensing of Environment,00344257,Elsevier BV,Netherlands,Wenpu Cao; Lei Dong; Lun Wu; Yu Liu,"Abstract Quantifying urban areas is crucial for addressing associated urban issues such as environmental and sustainable problems. Remote sensing data, especially the nighttime light images, have been widely used to delineate urbanized areas across the world. Meanwhile, some emerging urban data, such as volunteered geographical information (e.g., OpenStreetMap) and social sensing data (e.g., mobile phone and social media), have also shown great potential in revealing urban boundaries and dynamics. However, consistent and robust methods to quantify urban areas from these multi-source data have remained elusive. Here, we propose a percolation-based method to extract urban areas from these multi-source urban data. We derive the optimal urban/non-urban threshold by considering the critical nature of urban systems with the support of the percolation theory. Furthermore, we apply the method with three open-source datasets – population, road, and nighttime light – to 28 countries. We show that the proposed method captures the similar urban characteristics in terms of urban areas from multi-source data, and Zipf's law holds well in most countries. The accuracy of the derived urban areas by different datasets has been validated with the Landsat-based reference data in 10 cities, and the accuracy can be further improved through data fusion (κ = 0.69–0.85, mean κ = 0.78). Our study not only provides an efficient method to quantify urban areas with open-source data, but also deepens the understanding of urban systems and sheds some light on multi-source data fusion in geographical fields.",241,,111730,,Percolation theory; Zipf's law; Percolation; Mobile phone; Reference data (financial markets); Population; Sensor fusion; Computer science; Social media; Cartography; Remote sensing,,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation,http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019arXiv191012593C/abstract https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425720301000 https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/6845835,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2020.111730,10.1016/j.rse.2020.111730,3011301395,,0,002-283-643-240-063; 005-616-686-214-908; 006-008-142-168-349; 008-632-874-873-483; 012-234-778-590-855; 012-466-113-186-842; 016-530-050-596-674; 018-087-409-743-562; 020-621-418-408-327; 021-784-174-518-37X; 022-955-180-770-926; 024-819-036-950-072; 025-055-960-383-850; 029-171-590-002-849; 029-684-988-187-963; 030-326-735-720-737; 033-930-286-996-227; 035-330-712-776-483; 036-137-127-081-578; 038-739-744-351-183; 038-976-596-179-447; 045-348-848-215-886; 045-652-623-471-420; 046-710-718-173-361; 050-822-006-784-907; 051-703-948-988-107; 053-246-793-483-308; 053-687-377-456-240; 054-810-467-714-706; 057-545-918-303-995; 061-907-351-057-761; 063-144-713-034-736; 063-645-389-904-941; 064-794-917-153-64X; 067-213-684-126-245; 068-105-804-637-583; 070-328-778-973-857; 076-124-101-969-489; 076-913-637-716-617; 077-559-556-088-126; 079-133-928-309-378; 083-042-668-565-471; 087-401-634-324-001; 094-624-467-845-935; 096-977-459-155-826; 098-818-838-153-462; 103-777-506-943-151; 107-134-909-784-729; 109-124-599-485-080; 110-732-694-899-251; 135-269-448-655-396; 138-580-050-870-644; 141-084-053-292-259; 151-750-798-520-548; 173-395-460-832-004; 179-434-875-927-23X,5,,(doi) 10.1016/j.rse.2020.111730; (magid) 3011301395,en

Within this framework, there is a clear interest in better understanding how and why people value certain places over others. We introduce a new method that measures cultural preferences by exploring the potential of multiple online georeferenced digital photograph collections. Using ecological and social considerations, our study contributes to the detection of places that provide cultural ecosystem services. The degree of appreciation of a specific place is derived from the number of people taking and sharing pictures of it. The sequence of decisions and actions taken to share a digital picture of a given place includes the effort to travel to the place, the willingness to take a picture, the decision to geolocate the picture, and the action of sharing it through the Internet. Hence, the social activity of sharing pictures leaves digital proxies of spatial preferences, with people sharing specific photos considering the depicted place not only ""worth visiting"" but also ""worth sharing visually."" Using South Wales as a case study, we demonstrate how the proposed methodology can help identify key geographic features of high cultural value. These results highlight how the inclusion of geographical user-generated content, also known as volunteered geographic information, can be very effective in addressing some of the current priorities in conservation. Indeed, the detection of the most appreciated nonurban areas could be used for better prioritization, planning, and management",21,3,,,Environmental resource management; Wildlife conservation; Geography; Prioritization; Social activity; Social preferences; Volunteered geographic information; Ecosystem services; Crowdsourcing,,,,,https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol21/iss3/art6/ https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1493358/ https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol21/iss3/art6/ES-2016-8436.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.5751/es-08436-210306,10.5751/es-08436-210306,2465734108,,0,,41,,(magid) 2465734108; (coreid) 89402767; (doi) 10.5751/es-08436-210306,en

We present a new method for extracting main roads from high-resolution grayscale imagery based on directional mathematical morphology and prior knowledge obtained from the Volunteered Geographic Information found in the OpenStreetMap. The two salient steps in this strategy are: (1) using directional mathematical morphology to enhance the contrast between roads and non-roads; (2) using OpenStreetMap roads as prior knowledge to segment the remotely sensed imagery. Experiments were conducted on two ZiYuan-3 images and one QuickBird high-resolution grayscale image to compare our proposed method to other commonly used techniques for road feature extraction.

062-261-606-113-54X,Contingent Spaces of Collective Action: Evoking Translocal Concerns,2010-11-17,2010,journal article,M/C Journal,14412616,Queensland University of Technology,,Tarmo Pikner,"<jats:p>Collectives bring people and their concerns together. In the twenty-first century, this assembly happens across different material and virtual spaces that, together, establish connective layers of society. A kind of politics has emerged that seeks new forms of communication and expression and proposes new modes of (co)existence. Riots in the suburbs of metropolitan areas, the repair of a public village centre, railway workers’ strikes, green activists’ protests, songs in support of tsunami victims… These are some examples of collective actions that unite people and places. But very often these kinds of events and social practices take place and fade away too quickly without visible traces of becoming collectives. This article focuses on the contingent spaces that enable collective action and provide possibilities for “peripheral” concerns and communities to become public. The concept of “diasporas” is widened to permit discussion of how emerging (international) communities make their voices heard through political events. Some theoretical concepts will be illustrated, using two examples of collective action on 1 May 2009 that demonstrate different initiatives concerning the global (economic) crisis. Assembling Collectives and Affective Events  Building a house/centre and singing for something: these are examples of practices that bring people and their ideals together in a collective action or event. This article discusses the different communities that evolve within spaces that enable collective action. These communities are formed not only on the basis of nationality, occupation, or race; elements of (temporal) membership are created out of a wide spectrum of affiliations and a sense of solidarity. Hinchliffe (13) argues that collective action can be seen as a collection of affects that link together disparate places and times, and thus the collective is a matter of considerable political interest. The emergent spaces of collective action publicise particular concerns that may connect already existing but (spatially) dispersed communities and diasporas. However, there is a need to discuss the affects, places, and temporalities that make the assemblage of new collectivities possible. The political potential of collective spaces needs careful elaboration in order that such initiatives may continue to grow without extending the influence of existing (capitalist) powers.  Various communities connected “glocally” (locally and globally) can call new publics into existence, posing questions to politics which are not yet “of politics” (Thrift 3). Thus collective action can invent new connecting concerns and practices that catalyse (political) change in society. To understand the complex spatiality of collective action and community formations, it is crucial to look at processes of “affect”. Affects occur in society as “in-becoming” atmospheres and “imitation-suggestions” (Brennan 1-10) that stimulate concerns and motivate practices. The “imitation” can also be an invention that creatively binds existing know-how and experiences into a local-social context. Thinking about affects within the spaces of collective action provides a challenge to rethink what is referred to simply as the “social”. Massumi (228) argues that such affects are virtual expressions of the actually existing things that embody them; however, affects such as emotions and feelings are also autonomous to the degree that they exceed the particular body within which they are presently confined. The emerging bodies, or spaces, of collective action thus carry the potential to transform coexistence across both intellectual and physical boundaries, and communication technology has been instrumental in linking the affective spaces of collective action across both time and space.  According to Thrift, the collision of different space-times very often provokes a “stutter” in social relations: the jolt which arises from new encounters, new connections, new ways of proceeding. But how can these turbulent spheres and trajectories of collective action be described and discussed? Here the mechanisms of “events” themselves need to be addressed. The “event” represents, abstractly, a spatio-temporal locus where different concerns and practices are encountered and negotiated. “Event” refers to an incoming, or emerging, object (agent) triggering, through various affective responses, new ideas and initiatives (Clark 33). In addition to revolutions or tsunamis, there are also smaller-scale events that change how people live and come together. In this sense, events can be understood to combine individual and social “bodies” within collective action and imaginations. As Appadurai has argued, the imagination is central to all forms of agency, is itself a social practice, and is the key component of our new global order (Appadurai 29-30). Flusty (7) argues that the production of the global is as present in our day-to-day thoughts and actions as it is in the mass movement of capital, information, and populations which means that there should be the potential to include more people in the democratic process (Whatmore). This process can be seen to be a defining characteristic of the term cosmopolitics which Thrift describes as: “one of the best hopes for changing our engagement with the political by simply acknowledging that there is more there” (Thrift 189). For many, these hopes are based on a new kind of telematic connectedness, in which tele- and digital communications represent the beginning of a global networked consciousness based on the continuous exchange of ideas, both cognitive and affective.   Examples of Events and Collectives Taking Place on 1 May 2009  The first day in May is traditionally dedicated to working people, and there are many public gatherings to express solidarity with workers and left-wing (“red”) policy. Issues concerning work and various productions are complex, and recently the global economic crisis exposed some weaknesses in neoliberal capitalism. Different participatory/collective actions and spaces are formed to make some common concerns public at the same time in various locations. The two following examples are part of wider “ideoscapes” (official state ideologies and counter-ideologies) (see Appadurai) in action that help to illustrate both the workings of twenty-first century global capitalism and the translocal character of the public concern.  EuroMayDay  One alternative form of collective action is EuroMayDay, which has taken place on May 1 every year since 2001 in several cities across (mainly Western) Europe. For example, in 2006 a total of about 300,000 young demonstrators took part in EuroMayDay parades in 20 EU cities (Wikipedia). The purpose of this political action is “to fight against the widespread precarisation of youth and the discrimination of migrants in Europe and beyond: no borders, no workfare, no precarity!” (EuroMayDay). This manifesto indicates that the aim of the collective action is to direct public attention to the insecure conditions of immigrants and young people across Europe. These groups may be seen to constitute a kind of European “diasporic collective” in which the whole of Europe is figured as a “problem area” in which unemployment, displacement, and (possibly) destitution threaten millions of lives. In this emerging “glocality”, there is a common, and urgent, need to overcome the boundaries of exclusion. Here, the proposed collective body (EuroMayDay) is described as a process for action, thus inviting translocal public participation. The body has active nodes in (Western) Europe (Bremen, Dortmund, Geneva, Hamburg, Hanau, Lisbon, Lausanne, Malaga, Milan, Palermo, Tübingen, Zürich) and beyond (Tokyo, Toronto, Tsukuba). The collective process marks these cities on the map through a webpage offering contacts with each of the “nodes” in the network. On 1 May 2009, May Day events, or parades, took place in all the cities listed above. The “nodes” of the EuroMayDay process prepared posters and activities following some common lines, although collective action had to be performed locally in every city. By way of example, let’s look at how this collective action realised its potential in Berlin, Germany. The posters (EuroMayDay Berlin, ""Call"") articulate the oppressive and competitive power of capitalism which affects everyone, everyday, like a machine: it constitutes “the permanent crisis”. One’s actual or potential unemployment and/or immigrant status may cause insecurity about the future. There is also a focus on liminal or transitional time, and a call for a new collectivity to overcome oppressive forces from above that protect the interests of the State and the banks. EuroMayDay thus calls for the weaving together of different forms of resistance against a deeply embedded capitalist system and the bringing together of common concerns for the attention of the general public through the May Day parade. Another poster (EuroMayDay Berlin, ""May""), depicting the May Day parade, centres around the word “KRISE?” (“crisis”). The poster ends with an optimistic call to action, expressing a desire to free capitalism from institutional oppression and recreate it in a more humanistic way. Together, these two posters represent fragments of the “ideoscope” informing the wider, collective process.  In Berlin in 2009, thousands of people (mostly young) participated in the May Day parade (which started from the public square Bebelplatz), backed by a musical soundtrack (see Rudi). Some people also had posters in their hands, displaying slogans like: “For Human Rights”; “Class Struggle”; “Social Change Not Climate Change”; and “Make Capitalism a Thing of the Past”. Simultaneously, dozens of other similar parades were taking place across the cities of Europe, all bearing “accelerated affective hope” (Rosa) for political change and demanding justice in society. Unfortunately, the May Day parade in Berlin took a violent turn at night, when some demonstrators attacked police and set cars on fire. There were also clashes during demonstrations in Hamburg (Kirschbaum). The media blamed the clashes also on the economic recession and recently dashed hopes for change.  The Berlin May Day parade event was covered on the EuroMayDay webpage and on television news. This collective action connected many people; some participated in the parade, and many more saw the clashes and burning cars on their screens. The destructive and critical force of the collective action brought attention to some of the problems associated with youth employment and immigration though, sadly, without offering any concrete proposals for a solution to the problem. The emotional character of the street marches, and later the street fighting, were arguably an important aspect of the collective action inasmuch as they demonstrated the potential for citizens to unite, translocally, around affective as well as material grief (a process that has been given dramatic expression in more recent times with events in Egypt, Libya, and Syria). Further, although the recent May Day events have achieved very little in terms of material results, the network remains active, and further initiatives are likely in the future.   “Let’s Do It! My Estonia” On 1 May 2009, about 11,000 people participated in a public “thought-bee” in Estonia (located in north-eastern Europe in the region of the Baltic Sea) and (through the Estonian diaspora) abroad. The “thought-bee” can be understood as a civil society initiative designed to bring people together for discussion and problem-solving with regards to everyday social issues. The concept of the “bee” combines work with pleasure. The bee tradition was practised in old Estonian farming communities, when families in adjacent villages helped one another. Bees were often organised for autumn harvesting, and the intense, communal work was celebrated by offering participants food and drink. Similarly, during the Soviet era, on certain Saturdays there were organised days (obligatory) for collective working (e.g. to reconstruct sites or to pick up litter). Now the “bee” concept has become associated with brainstorming in small groups across the country as well as abroad. The number of participants in the May 1st thought-bee was relatively large, given that Estonia’s total population is only 1.4 million. The funding of the initiative combined public and private sources, e.g. Estonian Civil Society Foundation, the European Commission, and some companies.  The information sheet, presented to participants of the May 1st thought-bee, explains the event’s purpose in this way:  The main purpose of today’s thought-bee is to initiate as many actions as possible that can change life in Estonia for the better. My Estonia, our more enjoyable and more efficient society, will appear through smaller and bigger thoughts. In the thought-bee we think how to make life better for our own home-place... Let’s think together and do it! (Teeme Ära, ""Teeme"", translated from Estonian)  The civil society event grew out of a collective action on 3 May 2008 to pick up and dispose of litter throughout Estonia. The thought-bee initiative was coordinated by volunteers. The emotional appeal to participate in the thought-bee event on May 1st was presented and circulated in newspapers, radio, television, Internet portals, and e-mails. Famous people called on residents to take part in the public discussion events. Some examples of arguments for the collective activity included the economic crisis, the need for new jobs, self-responsibility, environmental pressures, and the general need to learn and find communal solutions. The thought-bee initiative took place simultaneously in about 500 “thought-halls” all over Estonia and abroad. Small groups of people registered, chose main discussion topics (with many suggestions from organisers of the bee) and made their groups visible as nodes on the “initiative” webpage. Other people had the opportunity of reading several proposals from the various thought-halls and of joining as members of the public brainstorming event on 1 May. The virtual and living map of the halls presented them as (green) nodes with location, topics, members, and discussion leaders. Various sites such as schools, clubs, cultural centres, municipality buildings, and theatres became part of the multiple and synchronous “space-times” within the half-day thought-bee event. Participants in the thought-bee were asked to bring their own food to share and, in some municipalities, open concerts were held to celebrate the day. These practices indicate some continuity with the national tradition of bees, where work has always been combined with pleasure. Most “thought-halls” were located in towns and smaller local centres as well as on several Estonian islands. Moreover, these thought-halls provided for both as face-to-face and online encounters. Further, one English-speaking discussion group was organised in Tallinn so that non-Estonian speakers could also participate. However, the involvement of Russian-speaking people in the initiative remained rather limited. It is important to note that these embodied spaces of participation were also to be found outside of Estonia—in Brussels, Amsterdam, Toronto, Oslo, Stockholm, Helsinki, Copenhagen, Prague, Baltimore, New York, and San Diego—and, in this way, the Estonian diaspora was also given the opportunity to become involved in the collective action. Following the theories of Thrift and Clark cited at the beginning of this article, it is interesting to see an event in which simultaneously connected places, embodying multiple voices, becomes part of the communal present with a shared vision of the future.  The conclusions of each thought-hall discussion group were recorded on video shortly after the event. These videos were made available on the “Let’s Do It! My Estonia” webpage. The most frequently addressed topics of the thought-bee (in order of importance) were: community activities and collaboration; entrepreneurship and new jobs; education, values; free time and sport; regional development; rural life; and the environment and nature conservation (PRAXIS). The participants of the collective action were aware of the importance of local as well as national initiatives as a catalyst for change. The initiative “Let’s Do It! My Estonia” continued after the events of May Day 2009; people discussed issues and suggested proposals through the “initiative” webpage and supported the continuation of the collective action (Teeme Ära, ""Description""). Environmental concerns (e.g. planting trees, reducing noise, and packaging waste) appear as important elements in these imaginings along with associated other practices for the improvement of daily life. It is important to understand the thought-bee event as a part of an emerging collective action that started with a simple litter clean-up and grew, through various other successful local community initiatives, into shared visions for a better future predicated upon the principles of glocality and coexistence. The example indicates that (international) NGOs can apply, and also invent, radical information politics to change the terms of debate in a national context by providing a voice for groups and issues that would otherwise remain unheard and unseen (see also Atkinson and Scurrah 236-44).   Conclusions  The collective actions discussed above have created new publics and contingent spaces to bring additional questions and concerns into politics. In both cases, the potential of “the event” (as theorised in the introduction of this article) came to the foreground, creating an additional international layer of temporal connectivity between many existing social groups such as unemployed young people or members of a village union. These events were both an “outcome” of, and an attempt to change, the involuntary exclusion of certain “peripheral” groups within the melting pot that the European Union has become. As such, they may be thought of as extending the concept of “diasporas” to include emerging platforms of collective action that aim to make problematic issues visible and multiple voices heard across the wider public. This, in turn, illustrates the need to rethink diasporas in the context of the intensive de-territorialisation of human concerns, “space-times and movement-trajectories yet to (be)come” (Braziel and Mannur 18). Both the examples of collective action discussed here campaigned for “changing the world” through a one-day event and may thus be understood in terms of Rosa’s theory of “social acceleration” (Rosa). This theory shows how both to the “contraction of the present” and the general instability of contemporary life have given rise to a newly affective desire to improve life through an expression of the collective will. Such a tendency can clearly take on far more radical forms as has been recently demonstrated by the mass protests and revolts against autocratic ruling powers in Egypt, Libya, and Syria. In this article, however, cosmopolitics is better understood in terms of the particular skills (most evident in the Estonian case) and affective spheres that mobilised in suggestions to bring about local action and global change.  Together, these examples of collective action are part of a wider “ideoscape” (Appadurai) trying to reduce the power of capitalism and of the state by encouraging alternative forms of collective action that are not bound up solely with earning money or serving the state as a “salient” citizen. However, it could be argued that “EuroMayDay” is ultimately a reactionary movement used to highlight the oppressive aspects of capitalism without offering clear alternatives. By contrast, “Let’s Do It! My Estonia” has facilitated interactive public discussion and the practice of local skills that have the power to improve everyday life and the environment in a material and quantifiable way. Such changes in collective action also illustrate the speed and “imitative capacity stimulating expressive interactions” that now characterise everyday life (Thrift). Crucially, both these collective events were achieved through rapid advances in communication technologies in recent times; this technology made it possible to spread know-how as well as feelings of solidarity and social contact across the world. Further research on these fascinating developments in g/local politics is clearly urgently needed to help us better understand the changes in collective action currently taking place.   Acknowledgements  This research was supported by Estonian Science Foundation grant SF0130008s07 and by the European Union through the European Regional Development Fund (Center of Excellence CECT).   References  Appadurai, Arjun. “Disjuncture and Difference in the Global Cultural Economy.” Theorizing Diaspora: A Reader.

Such an interface plays a fundamental role in interactions for knowledge sharing and the exchange of ideas on campus. Due to campus public spaces generally being considered as the leftovers between buildings and classrooms, undermanaged, and overlooked, little is known about the extent to which this built environment enables or inhibits creative encounters in such spaces. The inner-city campuses and science parks (SPs) of Amsterdam and Utrecht, the case-studies of this research, differ in terms of their location relative to the city, their masterplan typologies and the arrangement of buildings. However, they are similar in terms of the aforementioned issues of public spaces. The novelty of this research is the attempt to overcome such issues using an innovative mixed-methods approach that tests the ‘spatial affordances for creativity’ with empirical data collection and analysis. This raises the importance of mapping, quantifying and analysing the spatial distribution of momentary perceptions, experiences, and feelings of people with methods such as volunteered geographic information (VGI). The results show that proximity between multiple urban functions and physical features, such as parks, cafes and urban seating are important when it comes to explaining the high frequency of creative encounters between people. Urban designers of campuses can use the applied method as a tool to plan and design attractive public spaces that provide creativity through the transfer of tacit knowledge, social well-being, positive momentary perceptions, sense of community, and a sense of place.",17,20,7421,,Creativity; Sense of place; Sociology; Built environment; Urban design; Knowledge sharing; Tacit knowledge; Sense of community; Public space; Public relations,"public participatory geographic information system (PPGIS), spatial affordances for creativity; public space; science park; university campus; urban design; volunteered geographic information (VGI)","Built Environment; Cities; Creativity; Environment Design; Humans; Parks, Recreational; Residence Characteristics; Universities",,,https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Apure.rug.nl%3Apublications%2Fdd90a1fb-f8a1-4a66-b729-6c24e6275353 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7600694 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33053799 https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/20/7421,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17207421,10.3390/ijerph17207421,3092210593,PMC7600694,0,000-594-550-041-087; 000-762-412-801-711; 001-019-999-420-146; 005-414-719-879-805; 007-515-971-766-859; 008-191-278-198-740; 010-618-758-821-214; 016-546-479-880-340; 027-693-266-874-683; 031-951-546-032-070; 033-951-708-549-148; 038-817-266-925-306; 039-172-885-817-364; 042-372-820-905-317; 042-797-325-982-124; 044-061-932-114-901; 044-881-732-572-450; 047-189-343-743-349; 050-346-760-767-039; 050-543-879-542-489; 051-943-227-851-04X; 056-011-302-552-720; 057-545-918-303-995; 058-013-003-897-157; 059-589-843-185-580; 059-696-800-064-985; 060-699-077-074-47X; 065-427-448-539-292; 066-651-868-497-677; 072-340-865-663-923; 072-515-426-710-507; 075-597-475-535-304; 077-054-580-208-817; 077-314-337-554-70X; 078-977-021-065-516; 079-017-573-105-748; 079-765-210-789-267; 083-415-225-581-607; 084-664-189-523-402; 086-341-865-159-447; 095-697-297-325-964; 097-376-548-413-527; 097-612-174-011-049; 098-561-469-945-454; 098-749-023-468-379; 103-985-473-749-85X; 110-016-407-748-251; 116-257-057-735-535; 116-511-580-788-560; 124-858-701-170-39X; 139-252-816-037-909; 152-502-097-029-813; 157-076-225-370-112; 171-766-157-435-214; 197-009-451-029-634,1,,(pmcid) pmc7600694; (doi) 10.3390/ijerph17207421; (pii) ijerph17207421; (magid) 3092210593; (pmid) 33053799,en

In a LBSN, users socialize by sharing their location (also referred to as “geolocation”) in the form of a tweet (also referred to as a “check-in”), which contains information in the form of, but is not limited to, text, audio, video, etc., which records the visited place, movement patterns, and activities performed (e.g., eating, living, working, or leisure). Understanding the user’s activities and behavior in space and time using LBSN datasets can be achieved by archiving the daily activities, movement patterns, and social media behavior patterns, thus representing the user’s daily routine. The current research observing and analyzing urban activities behavior was often supported by the volunteered sharing of geolocation and the activity performed in space and time. The objective of this research was to observe the spatiotemporal and directional trends and the distribution differences of urban activities at the city and district levels using LBSN data. The density was estimated, and the spatiotemporal trend of activities was observed, using kernel density estimation (KDE); for spatial regression analysis, geographically weighted regression (GWR) analysis was used to observe the relationship between different activities in the study area. Finally, for the directional analysis, to observe the principle orientation and direction, and the spatiotemporal movement and extension trends, a standard deviational ellipse (SDE) analysis was used. The results of the study show that women were more inclined to use social media compared with men. However, the activities of male users were different during weekdays and weekends compared to those of female users. The results of the directional analysis at the district level reflect the change in the trajectory and spatiotemporal dynamics of activities. The directional analysis at the district level reveals its fine spatial structure in comparison to the whole city level. Therefore, LBSN can be considered as a supplementary and reliable source of social media big data for observing urban activities and behavior within a city in space and time.</jats:p>",9,2,137,,Trajectory; Geolocation; Visualization; Computer science; Social media; Cartography; Kernel density estimation; Big data; Activities of daily living; Social network,,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China-Yunnan Joint Fund,https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/9/2/137 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ijgi/ijgi9.html#RizwanWG20 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020IJGI....9..137R/abstract https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi9020137,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi9020137,10.3390/ijgi9020137,3007656098,,0,000-888-850-140-080; 000-898-335-892-033; 005-541-322-311-324; 005-976-709-493-495; 006-545-805-575-249; 020-410-585-172-091; 023-790-999-872-908; 030-733-668-655-645; 031-174-867-532-54X; 032-521-052-374-683; 037-313-203-574-339; 039-879-077-083-576; 041-768-093-505-169; 043-892-198-977-69X; 044-612-045-393-164; 046-868-458-183-431; 048-863-131-884-471; 049-209-175-282-667; 049-595-078-064-981; 058-442-203-980-874; 065-091-926-734-978; 065-727-434-895-514; 070-431-039-182-096; 076-777-887-137-403; 077-977-456-868-338; 080-767-855-588-491; 082-614-779-375-261; 083-815-892-430-282; 088-997-650-624-852; 089-092-368-058-615; 090-227-826-597-554; 094-152-506-147-302; 113-508-863-456-420; 117-406-551-230-500; 125-536-656-535-146; 128-633-397-844-764; 133-260-427-477-187; 134-751-232-917-632; 145-105-092-469-550; 149-652-288-741-18X; 160-059-812-152-623; 163-693-632-119-217; 164-233-751-793-174,2,,(magid) 3007656098; (doi) 10.3390/ijgi9020137,en

Volkow; Mei Po Kwan; Robert M. Kaplan; Michael F. Goodchild; Robert T. Croyle,"Spatial analysis using maps to associate geographic information with disease can be traced as far back as the 17th century. Currently, the widespread diffusion of geospatial data acquisition technologies is enabling creation of highly accurate spatial (and temporal) data relevant to health research.; ; New approaches in geography and related fields, capitalizing on advances in technologies such as geographic information systems (GIS), the Global Positioning System (GPS), satellite remote sensing, and computer cartography, are often referred to collectively as geographic information science (1, 2). GPS and related systems make it possible to integrate highly accurate geographic location and time with virtually any observation. GIS provides the means to store, share, analyze, and visualize real-time and archived spatial data. It also permits the integration of multiple layers of interdisciplinary spatial data, such as health, environmental, genomic, social, or demographic data, for interactive spatial analysis and modeling.; ; Spatial and spatiotemporal statistical methods (3), such as multilevel analysis, spatial data mining, and agent-based modeling, provide ways of relating health and disease to specific genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors (4). The density, accuracy, and specificity of current geospatial data also facilitate sophisticated spatial and spatiotemporal analysis and the modeling of complex spatial health processes at the level of the individual rather than the aggregate (5, 6) (see the figure). Research based on data-intensive real-time GPS/GIS methods with miniaturized “wearable” environmental and biomedical monitors is generating advances in exposure assessment, as well as in mobility and obesity studies (7). In addition to individual interventions, this research can lead to outcomes such as the design of healthier environments which enhance access to parks and quality foods, and better treatment programs for a wide range of health conditions, from asthma to diabetes.; ; ; ; Figure; ; Exposure assessment with GPS/GIS data of individuals; ; ; ; GIS visualization and analytical tools also enable researchers to identify spatial patterns and to model specific processes of disease diffusion or contagion, such as of pandemic influenza viruses, or evolving genetic strains of hepatitis or tuberculosis. Researchers have integrated patient demographics, daily activities, and HIV viral concentrations to map and model changing spatial patterns of HIV infections and their relationships to health care treatment programs (8), or to social risk factors (9). Researchers have also used GIS data, spatial statistics, and interactive mapping to identify HIV concentration hotspots near the Mexico–U.S. border (10). This kind of GIS-based analysis enables proactive and timely delivery of tailored prevention and treatment strategies, such as HIV testing, antiretroviral therapy intervention, and education to the affected communities.; ; Geospatial data on health and social environments have also been used to provide information about health disparities. Using GIS-based ethnic density measures and spatial data on mothers’ residential locations, a recent study of infant health inequalities among Bangladeshi immigrant women in New York City found that their infants were most vulnerable to poor health outcomes, such as low birth weight, when living either in very isolated settings or in areas of the highest ethnic density (11).; ; With real-time interactive GPS/GIS functionality (12) now increasingly embedded in cell phones and low-cost navigation and other mobile devices, individual citizens also are contributing to the flow of health-related geospatial data. These activities are variously referred to as participatory GIS, crowd-sourcing, or volunteered geographic information (x). Despite unresolved issues of privacy and quality assurance, the ability to access georeferenced data from millions of people could be transformative.; ; For example, by analyzing data from 15 million mobile-phone subscribers, Wesolowski et al. (13) could examine the complex interactions between human and animal movements and the spread of malaria in Kenya. From Japan to California, volunteers with GPS-enabled real-time air-quality monitoring systems are assessing exposures to air pollution and radiation at spatial resolution levels and data densities not previously feasible (14).; ; Better institutional and educational models for successfully integrating the spatial dimension into health research and practice are needed to achieve the full benefits of these new capabilities in a timely manner (15, 16). There is also an urgent need for the creation of distributed, interoperable spatial data infrastructures to integrate health research data across and within disparate health research programs. In addition to fostering standards and scientific access, such large-scale spatial data infrastructures are themselves powerful new resources for generating and testing hypotheses, detecting spatial patterns, and responding to health threats.; ; Ongoing collaborations between the NIH and the Association of American Geographers are addressing key technical and institutional challenges (e.g., standards, interoperability, common terminology, data confidentiality) to facilitate the generation, coordination, and use of the rapidly growing body of geospatial health data (17). Research agendas that systematically incorporate spatial data and analysis into global health research hold extraordinary potential for creating new discovery pathways in science (18).",339,6126,1390,1392,GIS and public health; Spatial analysis; Spatial data infrastructure; Data science; Participatory GIS; Computer science; Geographic information system; Volunteered geographic information; Enterprise GIS; Geospatial analysis,,Biomedical Research; Crowdsourcing; Epidemiological Monitoring; Geographic Information Systems; Humans; Spatial Analysis,,NCI NIH HHS (R13 CA162823) United States; NCI NIH HHS (R13CA162823) United States,https://www.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.1232257 https://experts.illinois.edu/en/publications/spatial-turn-in-health-research https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/339/6126/1390.full.pdf https://science.sciencemag.org/content/339/6126/1390.full http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3757548 http://science.sciencemag.org/content/339/6126/1390 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3757548/ https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3757548?pdf=render http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013Sci...339.1390R/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1232257,10.1126/science.1232257,2067982366,PMC3757548,0,000-260-230-390-86X; 001-500-247-282-343; 007-994-357-139-696; 010-648-561-405-548; 017-543-408-907-908; 019-733-617-968-045; 025-287-213-992-479; 028-901-700-817-471; 030-242-308-192-011; 044-656-179-990-065; 069-141-735-725-591; 071-137-895-384-626; 074-276-898-030-603; 107-871-467-093-495; 133-961-676-390-13X; 134-399-810-254-528,144,"research support, n.i.h., extramural; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research support, u.s. gov't, non-p.h.s.",(pii) 339/6126/1390; (pmid) 23520099; (doi) 10.1126/science.1232257; (magid) 2067982366; (pmcid) pmc3757548,en

General risk assessment procedures are discussed and the potential contributions of VGI are identified, in particular when quantitative characterization of factors such as Hazard, Vulnerability and Exposure is required. The review shows that the standard LRA procedures may benefit from input given by surveyors when performing hazard assessments, while crowdsourced data would be a valuable support in vulnerability/damage assessment studies. The review also highlights several limitations related to the role of VGI and crowdsourcing in LRA.",9156,,635,647,Risk assessment; Geomatics engineering; Vulnerability; Data science; Landslide risk assessment; Computer science; Volunteered geographic information; Crowdsourcing,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/iccsa/iccsa2015-2.html#ManciniCCCBR15 https://core.ac.uk/display/54009491 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-21407-8_45 https://iris.unimore.it/handle/11380/1093790,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-21407-8_45,10.1007/978-3-319-21407-8_45,2407610760,,0,028-089-072-077-622; 033-060-042-560-682; 040-142-724-864-918; 040-184-564-272-635; 050-551-433-162-326; 053-836-579-849-84X; 069-956-165-305-735; 071-547-407-522-754; 075-179-108-062-152; 082-183-685-037-024; 083-323-284-322-404; 100-658-081-773-407; 111-811-300-036-763; 114-760-212-833-887; 116-169-436-087-910; 137-579-997-071-680; 141-966-724-682-069; 143-517-570-321-322; 155-518-981-718-64X; 163-223-721-023-35X,1,,(magid) 2407610760; (coreid) 54009491; (doi) 10.1007/978-3-319-21407-8_45,it; en

An important indicator of progress towards malaria elimination is the prevalence of parasite infections in endemic populations. Information about malaria epidemiology is mostly derived from reports of confirmed acute malaria cases through passive case detection, whereas the prevalence of baseline subclinical malaria infections is much less known. In this study, cross-sectional surveys were conducted during the rainy season of 2017 in four townships (Bilin, Thabeikkyin, Banmauk and Paletwa) of Myanmar with divergent annual malaria incidences. A total of 1991 volunteers were recruited from local villages and Plasmodium subclinical infections were estimated by light microscopy (LM), rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and nested PCR. The nested PCR analysis was performed with a modified pooling strategy that was optimized based on an initial estimate the infection prevalence. The overall malaria infection prevalence based on all methods was 13.9% (277/1991) and it differed drastically among the townships, with Paletwa in the western border having the highest infection rate (22.9%) and Thabeikkyin in central Myanmar having the lowest (3.9%). As expected, nested PCR was the most sensitive and identified 226 (11.4%) individuals with parasite infections. Among the parasite species, Plasmodium vivax was the most prevalent in all locations, while Plasmodium falciparum also accounted for 32% of infections in the western township Paletwa. Two RDTs based on the detection of the hrp2 antigen detected a total of 103 P. falciparum infections, and the ultrasensitive RDT detected 20% more P. falciparum infections than the conventional RDT. In contrast, LM missed the majority of the subclinical infections and only identified 14 Plasmodium infections. Cross-sectional surveys identified considerable levels of asymptomatic Plasmodium infections in endemic populations of Myanmar with P. vivax becoming the predominant parasite species. Geographical heterogeneity of subclinical infections calls for active surveillance of parasite infections in endemic areas. The pooling scheme designed for nested PCR analysis offers a more practical strategy for large-scale epidemiological studies of parasite prevalence. Such information is important for decision-makers to put forward a more realistic action plan for malaria elimination.",12,1,1,9,Subclinical infection; Nested polymerase chain reaction; Tropical medicine; Parasitology; Asymptomatic; Malaria; Plasmodium falciparum; Plasmodium vivax; Biology; Environmental health,Malaria; Myanmar; Pooling strategy; Prevalence; Subclinical,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antigens, Protozoan/genetics; Asymptomatic Infections/epidemiology; Child; Child, Preschool; Cross-Sectional Studies; Endemic Diseases; Female; Geography; Humans; Infant; Malaria, Falciparum/diagnosis; Malaria, Vivax/diagnosis; Male; Microscopy; Middle Aged; Myanmar/epidemiology; Plasmodium falciparum/genetics; Plasmodium vivax/genetics; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Prevalence; Protozoan Proteins/genetics; Sensitivity and Specificity; Young Adult","Antigens, Protozoan; HRP-2 antigen, Plasmodium falciparum; Protozoan Proteins","NIAID NIH HHS (U19 AI089672) United States; the National institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,National institutes of Health (2U19AI089672)",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13071-019-3330-1 https://parasitesandvectors.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13071-019-3330-1 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30777127,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-019-3330-1,10.1186/s13071-019-3330-1,2921494062,PMC6378722,0,009-920-882-425-368; 010-789-127-919-051; 013-523-773-947-234; 018-235-165-588-51X; 018-556-630-112-996; 018-989-457-057-455; 021-068-854-406-198; 021-680-072-241-30X; 026-391-678-127-57X; 026-398-788-487-834; 030-829-727-122-758; 034-719-195-399-489; 035-946-219-806-365; 039-296-562-794-107; 041-157-628-202-170; 041-845-188-762-754; 044-165-085-273-309; 052-144-537-086-174; 052-790-160-600-212; 054-140-963-601-33X; 057-822-404-834-046; 060-658-480-288-987; 061-153-565-080-408; 064-049-602-050-320; 072-064-143-289-580; 072-929-072-374-322; 086-546-727-496-372; 093-088-135-233-964; 094-796-230-139-689; 108-709-498-169-115; 110-784-705-378-238; 113-848-642-411-449; 128-296-427-182-438; 129-398-340-827-76X; 130-318-006-255-949; 145-220-366-329-787,7,comparative study,(magid) 2921494062; (pmcid) pmc6378722; (pmid) 30777127; (pii) 10.1186/s13071-019-3330-1; (doi) 10.1186/s13071-019-3330-1,en

The comparison shows how sense of place is dynamic and changing over time and explores Kilburn High Road through the categories of location, locale and sense of place derived from the qualitative analysis of VGI content and annotations. The contribution shows how VGI can contribute to discovering the unique relationship between people and place which takes the form given by Doreen Massey to Kilburn High Road and then moves on to the many forms given by people experiencing Kilburn High Road through a photo, a Tweet or a simple narrative. Finally, the paper suggests that the analysis of VGI content can contribute to detect the relevant features of street life, from infrastructure to citizens’ perceptions, which should be taken into account for a more human-centered approach in planning or service management.</jats:p>",1,2,128,140,Advertising; Sense of place; Semantics; Content analysis; Narrative; Geography; Perception; Locale (computer software); Media studies; Service management; Volunteered geographic information,,,,,https://www.cogitatiopress.com/urbanplanning/article/download/614/614 https://usiena-air.unisi.it/handle/11365/999036 https://ideas.repec.org/a/cog/urbpla/v1y2016i2p128-140.html https://www.cogitatiopress.com/urbanplanning/article/view/614 https://econpapers.repec.org/article/cogurbpla/v_3a1_3ay_3a2016_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a128-140.htm,http://dx.doi.org/10.17645/up.v1i2.614,10.17645/up.v1i2.614,2465737539,,0,000-841-397-940-136; 000-988-456-477-871; 003-659-428-111-102; 014-314-799-673-126; 018-888-726-775-613; 018-944-179-546-339; 024-403-212-152-856; 024-908-127-778-807; 027-605-195-667-907; 027-961-404-366-424; 036-137-127-081-578; 049-634-274-450-838; 057-469-100-657-226; 057-545-918-303-995; 058-444-759-259-280; 059-315-026-596-832; 068-749-131-980-38X; 082-811-823-576-339; 092-066-938-806-849; 096-076-313-191-009; 099-518-226-114-86X; 118-883-357-472-862; 135-360-535-210-851; 140-607-059-580-618; 142-725-163-512-113; 145-137-481-759-099; 153-409-118-115-578; 154-848-889-994-591; 173-791-408-962-068; 187-263-067-667-958; 194-929-887-559-09X,8,,(doi) 10.17645/up.v1i2.614; (magid) 2465737539,it; en

This article explores factors affecting treatment-seeking behaviour for febrile illnesses in a remote area of Lao PDR. Household heads or their representatives (n = 281) were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. A total of twelve focus group discussions (FGDs) each with eight to ten participants were conducted in four villages. In addition, observations were recorded as field notes (n = 130) and were used to collect information on the local context, including the treatment seeking behaviour and the health services. Almost three-quarters (201/281) of respondents reported fever in past two months. Most (92%, 185/201) sought treatment of which 80% (149/185) sought treatment at a health centre. Geographic proximity to a health centre (AOR = 6.5; CI = 1.74–24.25; for those  3.6 km) and previous experience of attending a health centre (AOR = 4.7; CI = 1.2–19.1) were strong predictors of visiting a health centre for febrile symptoms. During FGDs, respondents described seeking treatment from traditional healers and at health centre for mild to moderate illnesses. Respondents also explained how if symptoms, including fever, were severe or persisted after receiving treatment elsewhere, they sought assistance at health centres. Access to local health centres/hospitals was often constrained by a lack of transportation and an ability to meet the direct and indirect costs of a visit. In Nong District, a rural area bordering Vietnam, people seek care from health centres offering allopathic medicine and from spiritual healers. Decisions about where and when to attend health care depended on their economic status, mobility (distance to the health centre, road conditions, availability of transport), symptoms severity and illness recognition. Current and future malaria control/elimination programmes could benefit from greater collaboration with the locally accessible sources of treatments, such as health volunteers and traditional healers.",19,1,252,252,Rural area; Health administration; Public health; Health care; Allopathic medicine; Malaria; Family medicine; Nursing research; Focus group; Medicine,Elimination; Febrile illness; Health seeking; Malaria; On the counter; Resistance,"Adult; Female; Fever/etiology; Focus Groups; Health Services; Humans; Laos; Malaria/complications; Male; Medicine, Traditional; Middle Aged; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Socioeconomic Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires",,Wellcome Trust United Kingdom; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (NA); Wellcome Trust (NA) United Kingdom,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/412624dx https://europepmc.org/article/MED/31018855 https://www.ndm.ox.ac.uk/publications/995458 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6480816 https://jglobal.jst.go.jp/en/detail?JGLOBAL_ID=201902250290685021 https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-019-4070-9 https://www.tropicalmedicine.ox.ac.uk/publications/995458 https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Apure.amc.nl%3Apublications%2F87438486-4c86-435b-974f-1793bc1c7b41 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31018855,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12913-019-4070-9,10.1186/s12913-019-4070-9,2947793424,PMC6480816,0,000-511-824-718-432; 005-651-890-092-526; 008-079-322-094-114; 011-473-188-247-653; 012-018-086-648-634; 012-480-437-159-585; 012-652-654-735-196; 012-723-281-577-097; 013-915-314-458-207; 014-746-784-598-388; 015-179-631-205-297; 015-366-246-817-813; 016-226-389-289-01X; 021-527-609-717-806; 021-825-169-903-562; 022-585-243-054-535; 023-997-679-547-354; 027-176-108-887-280; 031-433-929-974-743; 031-707-246-523-519; 033-207-317-131-064; 034-219-770-244-336; 035-121-510-391-736; 038-071-288-191-771; 041-179-066-554-437; 044-473-918-768-723; 048-860-349-266-197; 049-040-843-337-125; 051-621-057-426-718; 053-156-409-744-827; 056-154-913-717-297; 057-179-441-661-439; 057-511-622-726-301; 057-590-444-930-470; 058-425-819-673-712; 058-961-241-079-82X; 059-081-058-455-306; 062-473-979-226-453; 070-860-973-957-159; 073-484-801-374-830; 079-846-270-006-572; 080-105-295-938-242; 080-730-668-854-505; 081-373-727-735-279; 081-442-700-093-241; 082-814-332-549-276; 084-774-460-130-76X; 099-040-983-409-438; 106-485-116-695-724; 114-406-320-605-935; 136-618-752-060-265; 145-885-035-864-079; 152-455-473-233-529; 164-567-761-420-902,15,,(doi) 10.1186/s12913-019-4070-9; (pii) 10.1186/s12913-019-4070-9; (pmcid) pmc6480816; (magid) 2947793424; (pmid) 31018855,ja; en
066-652-233-253-956,Crowdsourcing: it matters who the crowd are. The impacts of between group variations in recording land cover,2016-07-26,2016,journal article,PloS one,19326203,Public Library of Science,United States,Alexis J. Comber; Peter Mooney; Ross S. Purves; Duccio Rocchini; Ariane Walz,"Volunteered geographical information (VGI) and citizen science have become important sources data for much scientific research. In the domain of land cover, crowdsourcing can provide a high temporal resolution data to support different analyses of landscape processes. However, the scientists may have little control over what gets recorded by the crowd, providing a potential source of error and uncertainty. This study compared analyses of crowdsourced land cover data that were contributed by different groups, based on nationality (labelled Gondor and Non-Gondor) and on domain experience (labelled Expert and Non-Expert). The analyses used a geographically weighted model to generate maps of land cover and compared the maps generated by the different groups. The results highlight the differences between the maps how specific land cover classes were under- and over-estimated. As crowdsourced data and citizen science are increasingly used to replace data collected under the designed experiment, this paper highlights the importance of considering between group variations and their impacts on the results of analyses. Critically, differences in the way that landscape features are conceptualised by different groups of contributors need to be considered when using crowdsourced data in formal scientific analyses. The discussion considers the potential for variation in crowdsourced data, the relativist nature of land cover and suggests a number of areas for future research. The key finding is that the veracity of citizen science data is not the critical issue per se. Rather, it is important to consider the impacts of differences in the semantics, affordances and functions associated with landscape features held by different groups of crowdsourced data contributors.",11,7,e0158329,,Geoinformatics; Semantics; Citizen science; Geography; Data science; Land cover; Social media; Volunteered geographic information; Crowdsourcing; Scientific method,,Cluster Analysis; Crowdsourcing/methods; Decision Making; Forests; Geography; Humans; Social Media,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/153394729 http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/103095/ http://www.zora.uzh.ch/126885 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4961420/ http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0158329 https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0158329 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/27458924 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016PLoSO..1158329C/abstract http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0158329,10.1371/journal.pone.0158329,2489882500,PMC4961420,0,002-555-907-164-663; 007-857-101-229-718; 010-390-048-140-045; 016-528-071-877-966; 019-868-554-220-635; 021-841-854-481-10X; 023-953-201-270-443; 024-720-419-067-05X; 025-013-504-375-325; 025-757-285-604-803; 027-736-997-184-595; 028-768-225-235-826; 030-884-205-316-813; 034-073-099-806-021; 036-045-596-267-027; 040-345-907-238-389; 045-906-185-696-503; 048-465-576-777-042; 052-337-679-284-249; 053-343-939-169-19X; 053-620-292-475-147; 057-545-918-303-995; 059-350-580-880-690; 078-715-695-348-758; 085-491-952-404-970; 095-122-467-723-862; 096-196-993-197-880; 097-734-470-796-122; 098-077-827-742-776; 099-523-636-461-537; 106-209-907-666-435; 107-651-735-933-928; 108-801-589-500-434; 109-484-051-622-78X; 111-249-750-238-260; 128-448-195-196-442; 128-630-302-259-009; 128-878-308-429-530; 135-360-535-210-851; 136-570-589-999-562; 141-047-060-911-705; 143-337-201-417-742; 147-658-527-072-695; 169-631-229-022-559; 188-678-650-340-531,20,,(pmid) 27458924; (pii) pone-d-15-49709; (coreid) 78260496; (pmcid) pmc4961420; (magid) 2489882500; (doi) 10.1371/journal.pone.0158329,en

Until now, studies have focused primarily on developed countries, showing that VGI content can match or even surpass the quality of authoritative sources, with very few studies in developing countries. In this paper, we compare the quality of authoritative (data from the Regional Center for Mapping of Resources for Development (RCMRD)) and non-authoritative (data from OSM and Google’s Map Maker) road data in conjunction with population data in and around Nairobi, Kenya. Results show variability in coverage between all of these datasets. RCMRD provided the most complete, albeit less current, coverage when taking into account the entire study area, while OSM and Map Maker showed a degradation of coverage as one moves from central Nairobi towards rural areas. Furthermore, OSM had higher content density in large slums, surpassing the authoritative datasets at these locations, while Map Maker showed better coverage in rural housing areas. These results suggest a greater need for a more inclusive approach using VGI to supplement gaps in authoritative data in developing nations",6,1,24,,Rural area; Regional science; Geography; Comparative case; Rural housing; Road networks; Population data; Volunteered geographic information; Cartography; Crowdsourcing; Developing country,,,,George Mason University,https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/6/1/24 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017IJGI....6...24M/abstract http://mars.gmu.edu/handle/1920/11374 https://core.ac.uk/display/89376925 http://ebot.gmu.edu/handle/1920/11374 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ijgi/ijgi6.html#MahabirSCCA17,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi6010024,10.3390/ijgi6010024,2575020676,,0,000-841-397-940-136; 007-684-128-166-136; 007-857-101-229-718; 009-712-132-498-449; 011-097-981-743-648; 014-425-368-123-634; 015-052-932-942-313; 015-784-251-884-385; 016-196-543-516-475; 017-194-800-561-718; 018-320-455-212-605; 021-041-484-242-674; 023-351-967-000-166; 023-953-201-270-443; 025-138-712-861-431; 026-645-756-189-301; 027-124-651-779-316; 029-143-519-124-802; 030-416-570-557-01X; 031-450-942-446-667; 032-353-715-439-039; 035-906-833-890-29X; 038-976-596-179-447; 040-267-517-107-219; 041-490-320-644-385; 042-251-963-818-156; 042-768-442-032-678; 043-233-278-248-72X; 051-837-257-256-154; 052-733-739-941-39X; 053-620-292-475-147; 057-545-918-303-995; 061-129-128-193-914; 063-737-377-767-343; 076-913-637-716-617; 081-521-711-222-032; 086-758-442-428-039; 088-339-711-439-200; 088-431-364-816-236; 089-593-433-574-591; 097-621-189-021-789; 098-565-405-790-308; 101-356-093-329-103; 106-264-944-278-433; 111-063-331-688-413; 129-672-011-124-595; 131-202-499-073-829; 135-315-223-941-716; 145-350-454-429-564; 171-544-875-588-246; 190-216-777-739-959; 198-122-408-150-421,24,,(magid) 2575020676; (coreid) 89376925; (doi) 10.3390/ijgi6010024,en

Dunham; Charles Kaylor,"Volunteered geographic information (VGI) has been heralded as a promising new data source for urban planning and policymaking. However, there are also concerns surrounding uneven levels of participation and spatial coverage, despite the promotion of VGI as a means to increase access to geographic knowledge production. To begin addressing these concerns, this research examines the spatial distribution and data richness of urban forest VGI in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and San Francisco, California. Using ordinary least squares (OLS), general linear models (GLM), and spatial autoregressive models, our findings reveal that sociodemographic and environmental indicators are strong predictors of both densities of attributed trees and data richness. Although recent digital urban tree inventory applications present significant opportunities for collaborative data gathering, innovative research, and improved policymaking, asymmetries in the quantity and quality of the data may undermine their effectiveness.

By February 2019, more than 20,000 users worldwide contributed approximately 6.3 million kilometers of streetscape sequences. In this study, we attempted to get a deep insight into the Mapillary project through an exploratory analysis from the perspective of contributors, including the development of users, the spatiotemporal analysis of active users, the contribution modes (walking, cycling, and driving), and the devices used to contribute. It shows that inequality exists in the distribution of contributed users, similar to that in other volunteered geographic information (VGI) projects. However, the inequality in Mapillary contribution is less than in OpenStreetMap (OSM). Compared to OSM, the other main difference is that the data collection demonstrated obvious seasonal variation because contributions to OSM can be accomplished on a computer, whereas images have to be captured on the streets for Mapillary, and this is considerably affected by seasonal weather.</jats:p>",9,1,10,,Data collection; Geography; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Exploratory analysis; Inequality; Volunteered geographic information; Cartography; Crowdsourcing,,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China-Yunnan Joint Fund,http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019IJGI....9...10M/abstract https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/9/1/10 https://ntnuopen.ntnu.no/ntnu-xmlui/handle/11250/2645750 https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi9010010 https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/9/1/10/pdf https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ijgi/ijgi9.html#MaFLD20,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi9010010,10.3390/ijgi9010010,2994737855,,0,000-756-236-294-499; 008-714-358-699-609; 013-614-460-601-607; 017-614-610-102-13X; 024-250-992-858-248; 026-955-692-571-424; 028-739-825-417-25X; 038-976-596-179-447; 046-082-447-805-261; 057-545-918-303-995; 065-589-177-067-570; 075-986-250-517-294; 117-889-713-446-267; 118-626-932-853-200; 126-576-668-406-897; 157-352-448-086-088,4,,(doi) 10.3390/ijgi9010010; (magid) 2994737855,en
068-746-185-815-183,The tasks of the crowd : a typology of tasks in geographic information crowdsourcing and a case study in humanitarian mapping,2016-10-18,2016,journal article,Remote Sensing,20724292,MDPI AG,Switzerland,João Porto de Albuquerque; Benjamin Herfort; Melanie Eckle,"In the past few years, volunteers have produced geographic information of different kinds, using a variety of different crowdsourcing platforms, within a broad range of contexts. However, there is still a lack of clarity about the specific types of tasks that volunteers can perform for deriving geographic information from remotely sensed imagery, and how the quality of the produced information can be assessed for particular task types. To fill this gap, we analyse the existing literature and propose a typology of tasks in geographic information crowdsourcing, which distinguishes between classification, digitisation and conflation tasks. We then present a case study related to the “Missing Maps” project aimed at crowdsourced classification to support humanitarian aid. We use our typology to distinguish between the different types of crowdsourced tasks in the project and choose classification tasks related to identifying roads and settlements for an evaluation of the crowdsourced classification. This evaluation shows that the volunteers achieved a satisfactory overall performance (accuracy: 89%; sensitivity: 73%; and precision: 89%). We also analyse different factors that could influence the performance, concluding that volunteers were more likely to incorrectly classify tasks with small objects. Furthermore, agreement among volunteers was shown to be a very good predictor of the reliability of crowdsourced classification: tasks with the highest agreement level were 41 times more probable to be correctly classified by volunteers. The results thus show that the crowdsourced classification of remotely sensed imagery is able to generate geographic information about human settlements with a high level of quality. This study also makes clear the different sophistication levels of tasks that can be performed by volunteers and reveals some factors that may have an impact on their performance.",8,10,859,,Conflation; Sophistication; Citizen science; Data science; CLARITY; Computer science; Humanitarian aid; Volunteered geographic information; Crowdsourcing; Typology,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/remotesensing/remotesensing8.html#AlbuquerqueHE16 https://doi.org/10.3390/rs8100859 https://core.ac.uk/display/46583040 http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/82959/ https://doaj.org/article/26f8ef1102c44d4ab06988bcae854514,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs8100859,10.3390/rs8100859,2532999214,,0,009-277-838-860-709; 009-680-290-520-847; 022-473-450-579-960; 025-911-207-476-300; 027-072-491-835-240; 028-338-041-114-464; 028-360-410-044-715; 029-211-443-400-058; 044-679-910-855-260; 044-937-786-034-906; 048-456-967-705-578; 050-550-068-666-512; 053-620-292-475-147; 053-668-765-543-510; 069-728-361-583-690; 101-472-790-171-979; 113-184-876-303-935; 128-630-302-259-009; 132-348-001-538-712; 132-492-536-863-34X; 136-570-589-999-562; 137-771-059-235-159; 147-213-981-170-541; 152-033-940-293-927,30,,(coreid) 90529802; (magid) 2532999214; (doi) 10.3390/rs8100859,en
068-915-820-106-891,Digging for care-seeking behaviour among gold miners in the Guyana hinterland: a qualitative doer non-doer analysis of social and behavioural motivations for malaria testing and treatment.,2020-07-06,2020,journal article,Malaria journal,14752875,BioMed Central,United Kingdom,Shirley D. Yan; Jennifer Orkis; Saifra Khan Sohail; Sean Wilson; Trish Ann Davis; J. Douglas Storey,"Although Guyana has made significant progress toward malaria control, limited access to malaria testing and treatment services threatens those gains. Mining activities create breeding environments for mosquitoes, and the migrant and mobile mining populations are hard to reach with information and services. The Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) has trained volunteers to test and treat malaria cases in remote regions. However, it remains unclear how miners perceive these testers, the services they provide, or what their malaria care-seeking behaviour is in general. To better address these challenges, Breakthrough ACTION Guyana and MoPH conducted qualitative research from October to November 2018 in Regions 7 and 8 in Guyana. A total of 109 individuals, 70 miners, 17 other mining camp staff, and 22 other key stakeholders (e.g. community health workers, pharmacists, and regional leadership), participated in semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions. Results were derived using a framework analysis, with an adjusted doer and non-doer analysis, and organized using the integrated behaviour framework. Miners sought MoPH-approved services because of close geographic proximity to testing services, a preference for public service treatment, and a desire to correctly diagnose and cure malaria rather than just treat its symptoms. Those who chose to initiate self-treatment—using unregulated medications from the private and informal sector—did so out of convenience and the belief that self-treatment had worked before. Miners who completed the full MoPH-approved treatment understood the need to complete the treatment, while those who prematurely stopped treatment did so because of medication side effects and a desire to feel better as soon as possible. Reasons why miners do and do not pursue malaria testing and treatment services are diverse. These results can inform better MoPH programming and new solutions to improve malaria outcomes in Guyana.",19,1,235,,Public health; Psychology; Nursing; Qualitative research; Malaria; Public service; Care seeking; Community health workers; Christian ministry; Focus group,Care-seeking; Gold miner; Guyana; Malaria; Rapid diagnostic tests; Social behaviour change,Gold; Guyana; Humans; Malaria/diagnosis; Male; Miners/psychology; Motivation; Patient Acceptance of Health Care/psychology,Gold,United States Agency for International Development (US) (#AID-OAA-A-17-00017),https://link.springer.com/10.1186/s12936-020-03289-3 https://jhu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/digging-for-care-seeking-behaviour-among-gold-miners-in-the-guyan https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12936-020-03289-3 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s12936-020-03289-3.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32631345 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7336500,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12936-020-03289-3,10.1186/s12936-020-03289-3,3040253829,PMC7336500,0,000-577-239-175-686; 005-693-285-551-873; 006-052-811-184-476; 006-566-457-517-634; 007-812-969-745-494; 008-436-197-164-947; 009-299-623-546-736; 009-567-980-157-526; 010-731-450-851-403; 012-970-517-548-005; 019-632-965-300-68X; 021-838-709-798-875; 023-632-645-553-586; 024-478-028-054-179; 028-102-434-188-308; 028-943-970-131-889; 029-088-126-517-139; 030-587-770-865-099; 033-258-275-619-87X; 036-535-577-409-001; 037-886-128-758-16X; 040-050-755-629-066; 042-178-112-531-343; 045-838-657-251-894; 046-251-396-556-131; 049-392-987-444-164; 053-666-321-018-820; 057-834-539-776-961; 061-513-490-417-93X; 062-340-165-157-920; 064-870-764-829-953; 072-477-473-411-388; 075-522-468-899-103; 087-000-886-929-448; 093-832-131-793-430; 103-536-504-530-815; 105-979-318-082-866; 121-237-911-859-549; 133-296-342-107-843; 148-876-482-243-172; 149-959-757-253-709; 160-613-081-982-898; 184-384-624-621-891,1,,(pii) 10.1186/s12936-020-03289-3; (pmcid) pmc7336500; (pmid) 32631345; (magid) 3040253829; (doi) 10.1186/s12936-020-03289-3,en

Several methods and workflows have been proposed to face quality issues in different VGI projects, usually built ad-hoc for specific datasets, thus resulting neither extensible nor transferable. In order to overcome this weakness, the authors propose to perform an user-driven assessment on VGI items in order to filter only those that satisfy minimally acceptable quality levels defined according to their specific quality requirements and project goals. In the present work the users, i.e., information consumers, are seen as decision makers and are allowed to set the minimum acceptable quality levels Thus the approach proposes a user driven assessment of the fitness for use of VGI items. The paper first briefly presents a view on VGI components and suitable quality indices, then it describes a logic architecture for managing them and for enabling a querying mechanism to the datasets. The approach is finally exemplified with a case study simulation.",II-3/W5,,277,284,Architecture; Workflow; Citizen science; Data science; Extremely Helpful; Quality assessment; User driven; Computer science; Information quality; Knowledge management; Volunteered geographic information,,,,,http://www.isprs-ann-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/II-3-W5/277/2015/isprsannals-II-3-W5-277-2015.pdf http://www.isprs-ann-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/II-3-W5/277/2015/ https://noa.gwlb.de/receive/cop_mods_00015484 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ISPAn.II3..277B/abstract https://doaj.org/article/68ecedfbe7c244a3b06dc415d0eacb31,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/isprsannals-ii-3-w5-277-2015,10.5194/isprsannals-ii-3-w5-277-2015,2284368193,,0,000-967-721-739-893; 007-684-128-166-136; 015-380-000-547-543; 027-666-068-785-379; 036-431-775-434-754; 038-976-596-179-447; 040-267-517-107-219; 042-592-168-544-091; 053-914-393-088-262; 057-545-918-303-995; 059-363-255-514-892; 063-813-028-394-106; 079-232-905-814-527; 095-607-318-877-177; 097-612-174-011-049; 097-773-332-306-457; 111-163-933-663-414; 111-901-923-536-480; 112-077-422-191-684; 124-043-027-110-303; 130-694-154-445-655,1,,(coreid) 91899196; (magid) 2284368193; (doi) 10.5194/isprsannals-ii-3-w5-277-2015,en

Integrating local knowledge, personal experience and up-to-date geoinformation indicates a promising approach for the theoretical framework and the methods of natural hazard analysis. Our systematic literature review aims at identifying current research and directions for future research in terms of Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) within natural hazard analysis. Focusing on both the preparedness and mitigation phase results in eleven articles from two literature databases. A qualitative analysis for in-depth information extraction reveals auspicious approaches regarding community engagement and data fusion, but also important research gaps. Mainly based in Europe and North America, the analysed studies deal primarily with floods and forest fires, applying geodata collected by trained citizens who are improving their knowledge and making their own interpretations. Yet, there is still a lack of common scientific terms and concepts. Future research can use these findings for the adaptation of scientific models of natural hazard analysis in order to enable the fusion of data from technical sensors and VGI.

It is the initiative of the President, Dr. Arabinda Mukharjee, and comes at a time when a lot is happening in the field in general and in our country as well. From a time when early Indian practitioners of neurology wondered about the existence of multiple sclerosis in India, perceptions have changed much in recent years. While India still appears to be a low-risk zone for multiple sclerosis based on our geographical location, cases are seen regularly in all parts of India, rural and urban. In the absence of robust epidemiological data, it is very difficult to have accurate perceptions of the incidence and prevalence of multiple sclerosis in India. Increasing numbers of neurologists and the uniform availability of diagnostic tools such as magnetic resonance imaging have helped increase the detection and diagnosis of cases. On the other hand, the possibility that the incidence is increasing cannot be denied, and this has been shown to happen in other Asian countries, such as Japan.; ; From the initial documentation of Indian patients with demyelinating disease, it was thought that the clinical pattern tended to be somewhat different in India, the optic nerves and spinal cord being affected more often: the “Asian MS.” Recent clinical and radiological studies on large cohorts of Indian multiple sclerosis patients have confirmed that their clinical profiles are similar to those seen in other parts of the world. The concept of Asian MS has given way to the recognition of neuromyelitis optica (NMO) as a distinct disease spectrum, and information is now available about NMO among Indians. The antibody detection rates in NMO spectrum disorders have increased in India, probably as test methodologies have improved. With the availability of tests throughout the country, the differential diagnosis between multiple sclerosis and NMO has become easier and therapies have improved. The increasing role of vitamin D in the causation of immunological disorders assumes importance in India, as large sections of the population are deficient in vitamin D, for unclear reasons.; ; This issue of Annals of Indian Academy of Neurology covers some of these aspects. Singhal, our senior neurologist with long-term experience in treating demyelinating disorders, gives an overview of multiple sclerosis in India with comments on local therapy issues. Bhatia et al. present information on the epidemiological and genetic aspects of multiple sclerosis in India. As can be seen, the available reports are few, and there is a clear need for multicenter efforts spread across the country. There are two papers on NMO. Pandit, with her special expertise in this condition, covers many aspects of the disease in India, and Biswas and Mukharjee deal with the therapeutic aspects of NMO. As radiology forms the mainstay of the diagnosis, Katdare and Ursekar discuss this important aspect of diagnosis in modern times, covering differential diagnosis. The subject of therapy for multiple sclerosis is presented in two parts. Coles discusses the conventional and the newer agents in the treatment of multiple sclerosis and Shah discusses the symptomatic therapies. Surya gives an overview of the rehabilitative measures for these diseases, an aspect that requires much attention in our local situation.; ; As can be seen from these papers, the diagnostic aspects of the disease have improved in India, but challenges face us in terms of the availability and affordability of therapies. As many Indians still bear medical expenses out of their own pocket, the feasibility of purchasing medicines becomes remote. There is a clear need for efforts toward subsidizing the drug costs and, possibly, evolving locally suitable treatment paradigms.; ; The Multiple Sclerosis Society of India is an active and vibrant organization. Initially started in Mumbai, it now has many branches throughout India, and volunteers are involved in rehabilitation and counselling work, arranging medical camps, and spreading awareness. Having been associated with them for over two decades, I have witnessed their dedicated work. Support from neurologists and cohesive work with such organizations can further the documentation of data on multiple sclerosis and create a stronger platform for the sufferers.",18,5,1,,Epidemiology; Psychiatry; Neurology; Alternative medicine; Disease; Multiple sclerosis; Population; Documentation; Location; Medicine,,,,,https://www.annalsofian.org/article.asp?issn=0972-2327;year=2015;volume=18;issue=5;spage=1;epage=1;aulast=Khadilkar https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4604690/ http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4604690 https://core.ac.uk/display/88256127,http://dx.doi.org/10.4103/0972-2327.164811,10.4103/0972-2327.164811,2122954986,,0,,4,,(coreid) 88256127; (doi) 10.4103/0972-2327.164811; (magid) 2122954986,en

Moreover, as a result of the advancements in 3D visualization, virtual globes able to visualize geographic data even on browsers emerged. However the integration of VGI systems and virtual globes has not been fully realized. The study presented aims to visualize volunteered data in 3D, considering also the ease of use aspects for general public, using Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). The new Application Programming Interface (API) of NASA, Web World Wind, written in JavaScript and based on Web Graphics Library (WebGL) is cross-platform and cross-browser, so that the virtual globe created using this API can be accessible through any WebGL supported browser on different operating systems and devices, as a result not requiring any installation or configuration on the client-side, making the collected data more usable to users, which is not the case with the World Wind for Java as installation and configuration of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is required. Furthermore, the data collected through various VGI platforms might be in different formats, stored in a traditional relational database or in a NoSQL database. The project developed aims to visualize and query data collected through Open Data Kit (ODK) platform and a cross-platform application, where data is stored in a relational PostgreSQL and NoSQL CouchDB databases respectively.</jats:p>",XLI-B4,,205,209,World Wide Web; Geoweb; NoSQL; Visualization; Computer science; JavaScript; Java; Relational database; Volunteered geographic information; Database; Application programming interface,,,,,https://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/XLI-B4/205/2016/ http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ISPAr41B4..205B/abstract https://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/XLI-B4/205/2016/isprs-archives-XLI-B4-205-2016.pdf https://doaj.org/article/f25960fa41e24cce802747555a760d55 https://noa.gwlb.de/receive/cop_mods_00012553,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-xli-b4-205-2016,10.5194/isprs-archives-xli-b4-205-2016,2435490111,,0,032-903-495-847-439; 057-545-918-303-995; 062-099-545-627-703; 094-416-942-316-56X; 170-997-405-099-54X,3,,(coreid) 91121422; (doi) 10.5194/isprs-archives-xli-b4-205-2016; (magid) 2435490111,en
072-218-511-452-222,A derivation of factors influencing the innovation diffusion of the OpenStreetMap in STEM education,2018-09-27,2018,journal article,Sustainability,20711050,MDPI AG,Switzerland,Steven J.H. Shiau; Chi-Yo Huang; Chia Lee Yang; Jer Nan Juang,"Geographic information is a confluence of knowledge from spatial science, information technologies, engineering, and mathematics, etc. Effective spatial training can enhance achievement in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. Therefore, the geographic information system (GIS) plays a daily role in modern STEM education. Volunteered Geographical Information (VGI) is characterized by the openness of the geographic information being generated and accumulated by volunteers. Within the VGI sphere, OpenStreetMap (OSM) is one of the most well-known VGI due to its openness, flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and web-based mapping capability, making it one of the best alternatives for use as the mapping application for STEM education. However, very few or no prior works have investigated the factors influencing the innovation diffusion of OSM in STEM education. Therefore, to fill this gap, this work aims to investigate these factors. To achieve this purpose, the authors have defined an analytic framework based on innovation diffusion theory (IDT) and the technology acceptance model (TAM). The factors influencing students’ acceptance and intention to continue using and diffusing OSM in STEM education will be investigated. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used to confirm the hypothesized IDT–TAM integrated model. An empirical study based on sample data collected from 145 Taiwanese undergraduate and graduate students from engineering-related institutes was used to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed analytic framework and to derive the factors related to the adoption and diffusion of OSM in STEM education. The proposed theoretical framework forged in this study was proven to be successful. Based on the empirical study results, ease of use, observability, and compatibility are the most influential factors in OSM diffusion. Therefore, activities that enhance the ease of use, observability, and compatibility of OSM should be emphasized so that STEM students’ perception of the usefulness of the technology and their perceived attitude towards it leads to the intention to continue the use of OSM. The analytic results can serve as a foundation for the design, development, and accelerated adoption and diffusion of OSM in STEM education.",10,10,3447,,Empirical research; Information technology; Usability; Technology acceptance model; Geographic information system; Knowledge management; Volunteered geographic information; Structural equation modeling; Openness to experience,,,,,https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/6526694 https://scholar.lib.ntnu.edu.tw/en/publications/a-derivation-of-factors-influencing-the-innovation-diffusion-of-t,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10103447,10.3390/su10103447,2893328597,,0,000-406-854-766-297; 000-645-500-692-014; 001-734-495-526-441; 002-999-188-044-418; 003-026-584-386-781; 003-346-974-049-548; 003-500-336-330-012; 003-790-539-563-041; 005-094-050-423-493; 006-743-551-051-96X; 007-857-101-229-718; 009-299-623-546-736; 009-775-170-577-322; 011-057-105-680-492; 011-662-962-045-923; 012-983-181-853-489; 013-704-996-545-278; 016-306-482-779-97X; 017-725-193-667-835; 018-639-324-903-689; 019-239-323-011-228; 019-341-027-327-798; 020-132-620-861-048; 020-749-054-636-988; 021-728-493-908-168; 023-069-883-104-479; 024-069-883-470-950; 024-657-440-722-144; 026-645-756-189-301; 027-193-768-666-47X; 027-946-092-420-034; 028-861-284-695-538; 029-263-057-554-467; 029-317-614-739-060; 030-416-570-557-01X; 030-975-962-975-895; 032-946-419-602-253; 035-435-666-144-880; 037-752-066-322-390; 038-554-574-805-187; 038-976-596-179-447; 039-676-949-536-668; 040-267-517-107-219; 043-213-633-162-472; 045-047-120-179-211; 045-250-197-358-14X; 045-904-613-623-054; 047-100-212-874-054; 047-101-548-342-291; 047-792-252-087-979; 048-341-636-122-319; 054-961-127-485-108; 055-879-366-891-633; 059-738-166-147-793; 063-143-775-968-046; 063-484-337-198-868; 064-776-870-077-790; 065-597-657-898-592; 065-757-362-549-512; 066-101-498-522-68X; 070-382-557-228-674; 072-813-199-606-608; 081-974-162-058-824; 087-917-229-839-201; 088-339-711-439-200; 090-857-243-142-060; 092-038-055-009-485; 095-099-121-271-560; 096-707-537-507-891; 097-612-174-011-049; 097-710-204-601-613; 101-264-886-486-557; 106-046-384-095-085; 106-264-944-278-433; 107-091-075-810-582; 108-931-119-914-03X; 120-300-483-369-676; 122-075-328-129-458; 123-118-946-446-710; 123-624-156-422-361; 127-656-934-943-764; 128-535-553-363-454; 130-371-336-818-76X; 130-443-907-195-915; 131-090-566-608-093; 131-146-822-056-25X; 131-568-073-527-092; 132-151-415-414-497; 139-247-442-555-499; 141-006-478-920-51X; 145-350-454-429-564; 150-270-656-406-193; 152-793-667-930-21X; 155-177-757-678-986; 159-882-720-631-622; 168-036-345-097-619; 171-043-332-359-206; 171-544-875-588-246; 173-415-308-750-78X; 175-293-077-700-354; 180-200-378-185-785; 183-799-923-201-617; 190-216-777-739-959; 190-246-814-966-85X,5,,(magid) 2893328597; (doi) 10.3390/su10103447,en

This includes items such as collecting metadata on the volunteer, providing suitable training, giving corrective feedback during the mapping process and use of control data, among others. Two examples of VGI data collection are then considered with respect to this quality control framework, i.e. VGI data collection by National Mapping Agencies and by the most recent Geo-Wiki tool, a game called Cropland Capture. Although good practices are beginning to emerge, there is still the need for the development and sharing of best practice, especially if VGI is to be integrated with authoritative map products or used for calibration and/or validation of land cover in the future.",II-3/W5,,317,324,Data collection; Best practice; Citizen science; Data quality; Corrective feedback; Land cover; Computer science; Knowledge management; Volunteered geographic information; Metadata,,,,,https://noa.gwlb.de/receive/cop_mods_00015475 https://research.aston.ac.uk/en/publications/vgi-quality-control https://www.isprs-ann-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/II-3-W5/317/2015/ https://www.isprs-ann-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/II-3-W5/317/2015/isprsannals-II-3-W5-317-2015.pdf http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/14253/ http://publications.aston.ac.uk/27109/ https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ISPAn.II3..317F/abstract https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Aris.utwente.nl%3Apublications%2Fd1afc81a-4457-4b9e-a18f-66d7988a89c9 http://eprints.aston.ac.uk/27109/ https://research.utwente.nl/en/publications/vgi-quality-control https://doaj.org/article/2cc150be7789439a9ea2d36390609ea4,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/isprsannals-ii-3-w5-317-2015,10.5194/isprsannals-ii-3-w5-317-2015,2209272682,,0,002-555-907-164-663; 006-548-035-543-374; 010-390-048-140-045; 022-473-450-579-960; 023-290-850-444-285; 026-645-756-189-301; 029-211-443-400-058; 029-340-611-176-878; 030-416-570-557-01X; 030-975-962-975-895; 033-060-042-560-682; 037-838-408-294-279; 038-545-428-814-750; 038-976-596-179-447; 039-195-346-961-705; 040-267-517-107-219; 043-631-090-869-739; 050-539-693-523-843; 051-212-304-333-520; 051-672-609-357-192; 053-620-292-475-147; 057-545-918-303-995; 066-836-887-363-077; 072-595-001-841-272; 095-607-318-877-177; 096-283-425-452-332; 097-612-174-011-049; 103-407-805-390-843; 108-451-615-191-851; 124-840-797-218-937; 128-448-195-196-442; 147-213-981-170-541,8,,(magid) 2209272682; (doi) 10.5194/isprsannals-ii-3-w5-317-2015; (coreid) 92059082,en

073-480-282-116-582,Geodemographic biases in crowdsourced knowledge websites: Do neighbours fill in the blanks?,2017-05-25,2017,journal article,GeoJournal,03432521; 15729893,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Netherlands,Jonathan Bright; Stefano De Sabbata; Sumin Lee,"Crowdsourced knowledge websites such as Wikipedia and OpenStreetMap are increasingly attracting a critical literature which has highlighted the fact that the contributor bases of these sites are often geodemographically biased: drawn from more affluent and better educated segments of the population. However, while bias in contributors is well known, we know less about whether this also results in a bias in outcomes on these websites: or whether the partial portion of the population which does make contributions also works to “fill in the blanks”, by adding knowledge about other less well-off neighbouring areas which have not attracted a contributor base. This article addresses the question of whether such “neighbourhood effects” exist in practice. It makes use of a novel dataset of alcohol license data in the UK to assess variation in the completeness of the volunteer geographic information site OpenStreetMap. The results support existing literature in showing that completeness is related to demographics: areas with higher levels of wealth and education typically exhibit higher levels of completeness. The article then makes a novel contribution by showing evidence of the existence of neighbourhood effects: poorer regions with more affluent neighbours typically having higher levels of completeness than poorer regions which are also surrounded by poorer neighbours. The results suggest that crowdsourced knowledge websites can aspire to a kind of completeness even whilst user bases remain partial and biased.",83,3,427,440,Internet privacy; Neighbourhood (mathematics); Geography; Geodemographic segmentation; Demographics; License; Population; Public relations; Completeness (statistics); Crowdsourcing; Human geography,,,,ERANET Joint Programming Initiative,"https://paperity.org/p/79883653/geodemographic-biases-in-crowdsourced-knowledge-websites-do-neighbours-fill-in-the-blanks https://core.ac.uk/display/83936554 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10708-017-9778-7 http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/),",http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10708-017-9778-7,10.1007/s10708-017-9778-7,2618530486,,0,000-756-236-294-499; 002-033-358-303-30X; 007-230-384-585-931; 012-649-655-761-647; 013-445-037-365-411; 020-132-620-861-048; 020-606-051-046-036; 021-041-484-242-674; 027-108-336-376-082; 030-217-575-405-566; 035-638-865-449-628; 036-743-124-996-801; 038-976-596-179-447; 041-899-886-641-400; 044-556-168-236-763; 047-652-458-101-444; 047-833-007-161-424; 057-545-918-303-995; 057-658-994-872-867; 063-239-742-435-514; 063-318-196-778-338; 065-892-703-918-067; 069-305-832-957-026; 071-516-807-119-516; 080-735-180-107-584; 084-045-814-788-797; 086-758-442-428-039; 088-339-711-439-200; 089-318-185-123-321; 099-655-864-667-697; 100-866-038-545-202; 113-916-675-831-804; 128-630-302-259-009; 128-841-273-022-431; 132-264-759-729-135; 134-167-669-311-390; 138-847-225-776-212; 144-096-391-736-702; 149-993-033-590-020; 173-170-629-265-037; 195-019-623-135-107,9,,(doi) 10.1007/s10708-017-9778-7; (magid) 2618530486; (coreid) 96710012,en
073-652-094-513-327,VGI FOR LAND ADMINISTRATION - A QUALITY PERSPECTIVE,2013-05-14,2013,journal article,"ISPRS - International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences",21949034,Copernicus GmbH,,Gerhard Navratil; Andrew U. Frank,"<jats:p>Abstract. Since the use of volunteered geographic information (VGI) or crowd sourced data (Goodchild, 2007) became more common, several people proposed the use of such methods of data collection for various fields. Success stories were Wikipedia encyclopaedia and OpenStreetMap (OSM), but also using VGI in land administration has been proposed. Robin McLaren proposed crowd sourcing as a way to get a new citizen collaboration model in land administration to enhance transparency and decrease costs (McLaren, 2011). Keenja et al. discussed the perception of VGI within the Dutch cadastre (Keenja, De Vries, Bennet, &amp;amp; Laarakker, 2012). Basiouka and Potsiou even discuss how crowd sourcing can be used to identify errors in the Hellenic cadastre (Basiouka &amp;amp; Potsiou, 2012). One problem of VGI is the quality control (compare Goodchild &amp;amp; Li, 2012). The problem with most data in a land administration system is that there is only a small group of people that can verify the correctness of information. The correct location of a boundary, for example, can only be assessed by the owners of the pieces of land touching at the boundary (and surveyors after investigation and measurement). How shall VGI then provide reliable data? Boundaries between areas of different use may be visible but land administration is often interested in ownership boundaries. In the paper we discuss the types of data used in land administration as discussed by Dale and McLaughlin (1999). These categories are then analyzed to identify the areas where VGI can actually provide reliable input. What we hope to learn from such an analysis is how to use the methodology of crowd sourcing for land administration, even if the data collection authoritatively.;                     </jats:p>",XL-2/W1,1,159,163,Data collection; Cadastre; Data type; Encyclopedia; Geography; Data science; Land administration; Operations research; Correctness; Volunteered geographic information; Transparency (graphic),,,,,http://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/XL-2-W1/159/2013/isprsarchives-XL-2-W1-159-2013.html http://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/XL-2-W1/159/2013/isprsarchives-XL-2-W1-159-2013.pdf https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ISPAr.XL2a.159N/abstract https://noa.gwlb.de/receive/cop_mods_00022708 https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/e/9780429155765/chapters/10.1201/b19160-17,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/isprsarchives-xl-2-w1-159-2013,10.5194/isprsarchives-xl-2-w1-159-2013,2132643790,,0,015-576-334-059-042; 046-626-328-936-165; 057-545-918-303-995; 089-137-352-340-487; 097-612-174-011-049; 106-813-535-159-897; 123-590-747-812-692; 147-876-713-700-216; 156-221-407-258-019,9,,(coreid) 91678205; (doi) 10.5194/isprsarchives-xl-2-w1-159-2013; (magid) 2132643790,en

Des Jarlais; Sandro Galea; Melissa Tracy; Susan Tross; David Vlahov,"Both the fear of people who are different and the fear of disease can lead to social stigmatization.1 Occasionally these fears co-occur, resulting in severe stigmatization of strangers with diseases. Such stigmatization can increase the adverse consequences of a disease in multiple ways. First, stigmatization can substantially increase the suffering of persons with the disease. Second, persons with or at risk for the disease may avoid seeking health care, making it much harder for public health authorities to control the disease. Third, professionals and volunteers working in the field may also become stigmatized, leading to higher rates of stress and burnout.2 Finally, stigmatization may generate considerable economic losses if people avoid groups or geographic areas associated with the disease.; ; Many diseases have been stigmatized throughout history. For example, persons with the plague were stigmatized during the Middle Ages, and sexually transmitted diseases have been stigmatized throughout the last several centuries.3,4 Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) has been one of the most feared and stigmatized diseases of the last 20 years. There is abundant evidence that the stigmatization of AIDS has been detrimental to the health of those with AIDS and has played a role in limiting public health and medical efforts to control the disease.5,6 For example, early stigmatization of AIDS as a disease of homosexual men contributed to low levels of funding for AIDS research in the1980s.3,4,7; ; Over the last several years, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has emerged as a new feared disease associated with strangers (Asians, particularly Chinese) and has generated considerable stigmatization.8,9 Reduced travel to SARS-affected areas clearly led to large economic losses for those areas,10,11 but there has been relatively little systematic research on fear of SARS or stigmatization of persons with or at risk for the disease.12 In one study of medical access patterns in Taiwan, Chang and colleagues found that “fear of SARS” led to substantial reductions in seeking medical care: a 23.9% reduction for ambulatory care, a 35.2% reduction for inpatient care, and a 16.7% reduction for dental care.13 Presumably, people avoided seeking medical care out of fear of becoming infected with SARS in these medical settings. Studying the stigmatization of SARS may provide us with insight into the stigma associated with emerging infectious diseases and the potential consequences of such stigmatization.; ; A potentially useful model for considering stigmatization of SARS and other newly emerging infectious diseases may be found in the work of Pryor et al.14 They suggest a 2-factor theory of HIV- related stigma: (1) an immediate affective reaction, based on multiple negative qualities associated with the disease (e.g., death, promiscuity, drug use, homosexuality), possibly followed by (2) a cognitive rule-based system that ameliorates stigmatization “if perceivers have enough time, motivation, and cognitive resources.”14(p1189) Within this formulation, availability of additional information about the disease should lead to a reduction in stigmatization. This prediction is consistent with the activities of many public health authorities who hope to reduce stigmatization through increased public education on diseases such as AIDS.; ; We compared stigmatizing attitudes toward AIDS and SARS in a representative sample of persons living in the New York City (NYC) metropolitan area and examined factors associated with these attitudes.",96,3,561,567,Psychiatry; Ambulatory care; Mental health; Public health; Health care; Stigma (botany); Disease; Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); Population; Medicine,,Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/psychology; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; New York City; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome/psychology; Socioeconomic Factors; Stereotyping,,NIMH NIH HHS (MH066391) United States; NIDA NIH HHS (DA003574) United States; NIDA NIH HHS (R01 DA003574) United States; NIDA NIH HHS (R01 DA017642) United States; NIDA NIH HHS (DA017642) United States; NIMH NIH HHS (R01 MH066391) United States,https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/16449597 https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/40384 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16449597 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16449597/ https://ideas.repec.org/a/aph/ajpbhl/10.2105-ajph.2004.054742_5.html https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=1451670 https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2004.054742 https://nyuscholars.nyu.edu/en/publications/stigmatization-of-newly-emerging-infectious-diseases-aids-and-sar https://covid19.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/stigmatization-of-newly-emerging-infectious-diseases-aids-and-sar-13,http://dx.doi.org/10.2105/ajph.2004.054742,10.2105/ajph.2004.054742,2072910994,PMC1470501,0,001-662-875-531-39X; 011-284-133-503-901; 018-041-615-688-302; 020-515-893-713-073; 041-787-384-119-915; 045-219-742-026-576; 058-110-554-972-998; 062-662-526-901-076; 065-672-835-703-485; 075-552-262-494-546; 091-348-111-457-491; 098-074-123-274-544; 100-267-161-908-705; 122-024-253-242-244; 127-068-023-430-457; 161-577-710-412-355; 172-094-684-407-159,59,"research support, n.i.h., extramural",(pii) ajph.2004.054742; (pmcid) pmc1470501; (doi) 10.2105/ajph.2004.054742; (magid) 2072910994; (pmid) 16449597,en; es

Jennings Anderson; Dipto Sarkar; Leysia Palen,"OpenStreetMap (OSM), the largest Volunteered Geographic Information project in the world, is characterized both by its map as well as the active community of the millions of mappers who produce it. The discourse about participation in the OSM community largely focuses on the motivations for why members contribute map data and the resulting data quality. Recently, large corporations including Apple, Microsoft, and Facebook have been hiring editors to contribute to the OSM database. In this article, we explore the influence these corporate editors are having on the map by first considering the history of corporate involvement in the community and then analyzing historical quarterly-snapshot OSM-QA-Tiles to show where and what these corporate editors are mapping. Cumulatively, millions of corporate edits have a global footprint, but corporations vary in geographic reach, edit types, and quantity. While corporations currently have a major impact on road networks, non-corporate mappers edit more buildings and points-of-interest: representing the majority of all edits, on average. Since corporate editing represents the latest stage in the evolution of corporate involvement, we raise questions about how the OSM community—and researchers—might proceed as corporate editing grows and evolves as a mechanism for expanding the map for multiple uses.",8,5,232,,Business; Data quality; Data science; Open data; Road networks; Volunteered geographic information; Geospatial analysis,,,,"Center for Hierarchical Manufacturing, National Science Foundation",https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ijgi/ijgi8.html#AndersonSP19 https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/8/5/232 http://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/8/5/232 https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/8/5/232/pdf https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi8050232,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi8050232,10.3390/ijgi8050232,2946303255,,0,002-033-358-303-30X; 002-138-818-558-68X; 005-365-658-268-390; 007-928-023-461-84X; 008-655-662-451-459; 008-714-358-699-609; 008-761-857-870-847; 015-676-010-694-208; 021-041-484-242-674; 022-473-450-579-960; 022-816-728-271-154; 024-403-212-152-856; 030-975-962-975-895; 035-161-913-145-763; 038-976-596-179-447; 043-048-736-852-883; 045-151-807-050-043; 046-716-045-570-588; 048-702-561-381-148; 063-599-343-217-316; 064-214-528-320-463; 068-351-145-806-34X; 077-946-591-787-539; 084-630-670-678-464; 088-339-711-439-200; 089-318-185-123-321; 098-565-405-790-308; 119-008-397-855-367; 129-909-646-150-845; 132-462-317-939-618; 141-306-112-717-757,9,,(magid) 2946303255; (doi) 10.3390/ijgi8050232,en
074-771-823-459-585,Histoplasma capsulatum: More Widespread than Previously Thought,2014-04-28,2014,journal article,The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,14761645; 00029637,American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene,United States,Spinello Antinori,"Histoplasmosis is an endemic mycosis caused by a dimorphic fungus with two distinct varieties pathogenic for humans: Histoplasma capsulatum var. capsulatum and H. capsulatum var. duboisii. The latter is known to be restricted to sub-Saharan Africa, whereas the former is distributed worldwide. However, general textbooks of medical mycology when considering the geographic distribution of H. capsulatum var. capsulatum either refer only to “eastern United States (Ohio, Mississippi, and St. Lawrence River valleys) and most of Latin America,”1 or indicate that “isolated cases have been reported also from Southeast Asia and Africa.”2 In this issue of the Journal, Wang and others3 describe an autochthonous case of disseminated progressive histoplasmosis (DPH) observed in a young human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative Chinese man. This report adds to the growing evidence from epidemiological surveys using histoplasmin skin tests,4 case reports,5 and a recent review of the literature6 (mostly of works written in Chinese) indicating that some areas of China should be included among those with medium-high endemicity for H. capsulatum. However, because China is one of the largest countries in the world, epidemiological information for clinicians should take into account which specific areas are involved. In this regard the histoplasmin skin test survey conducted by Zhao and others,4 showed an overall reactivity of 9.0% among 735 healthy volunteers and patients with lung diseases, with the highest prevalence observed in Hunan (8.9%) and Jiangsu (15.1%) provinces. In good agreement, in a review of 300 cases of histoplasmosis diagnosed in China (75% considered autochthonous),6 the geographical distribution of patients was 27.7% from Yunnan, 9.3% from Jiangsu and Hunan, 8.7% from Hubei and 7.3% from Sichuan. Another histoplasmin skin test survey conducted on 271 healthy students from Sichuan province showed a prevalence ranging from 6% to 35%, with the highest recorded in the southern part of the province.7; ; Overall, nearly 82% of all reviewed cases of histoplasmosis from China were reported from nine provinces through which the Yangtze River flows and where climate conditions are probably favorable for H. capsulatum growth6; it is worth noting that 86% of these cases were classified as disseminated, and in 52% of affected patients no underlying diseases were disclosed.; ; India is another Asian country where H. capsulatum is known to be endemic, although the true prevalence of this mycosis is still underappreciated. The first case was reported as early as 1954, and since then several cases (mostly DPH, even in the absence of underlying immunosuppression) have been published.8–10; ; In India the majority of histoplasmosis cases were reported from the eastern and north-eastern part of the country, especially from Calcutta (West Bengal) and Assam. Interestingly, as observed for the highly endemic areas in North America, both states are crossed by long rivers: the Ganges and the Brahamaputra, respectively.8–10 Moreover, the fungus was isolated from the soil of the Gangetic plains.11 A histoplasmin skin-test positivity rate of 12.3% was reported in northern India between the 1950s and 1970s.12; ; It has been hypothesized that in India a large number of cases might be unrecognized for a long period caused by low awareness of the disease and misdiagnose as tuberculosis or leishmaniasis.8,10 Oral cavity ulcers and bilateral adrenal enlargement seem to be particularly frequent among Indian patients, whereas skin lesions were observed in only 8% of cases.8,10 Also in the review of Chinese patients skin involvement was reported in a small fraction of cases (6.6%) and the authors speculated about the low number of HIV-positive patients in their file records.6 High rates of skin involvement have been observed among HIV-positive patients from South America and Africa.13; ; Thailand is another country of South-east Asia where localized foci of H. capsulatum exist, and the fungus has been shown by using nested polymerase chain reaction of soil contamined with bat guano and chicken droppings from Chiang Mai, a geographic area where Penicillium marneffei is also endemic.14 In contrast to the Chinese and Indian experiences, DPH in Thailand has been observed almost exclusively among HIV-infected patients, with 1,253 cases reported from 1984 to 2010 to the Ministry of Public Health.14; ; Based on sporadic case reports of autochthonous histoplasmosis, isolation of the fungus from soil in bat-infested caves and histoplasmin skin test surveys, Malaysia, Indonesia, Myanmar, and the Philippines should also be considered areas with pockets of endemicity for histoplasmosis.15,16 Interestingly, in a recent survey conducted in Europe, cases of disseminated histoplasmosis were diagnosed among elderly United Kingdom residents who had served in World War II in India and Myanmar and who did not leave their country of origin for more than 50 years after returning home.17; ; In Australia, cases of indigenous histoplasmosis were reported as early as 1948, and the organism has been cultured from fowl yards and caves, although the exact ecology is poorly understood18; the majority of cases were reported from the Queensland and northern New South Wales regions, which are characterized by tropical and subtropical climate. These regions are also crossed by long rivers (the Dumaresq and Macintyre rivers).; ; Outside Asia autochthonous cases of histoplasmosis have been reported sporadically from Italy,13,17 where studies conducted in the 1960s confirmed the presence of H. capsulatum in soil19 and animals,20 with the existence (confirmed with histoplasmin skin tests) of a pocket of endemicity along the Po River valley.21; ; Histoplasma capsulatum var. duboisii, characterized by a larger size (8–15 μm) and thicker walls than H. capsulatum var. capsulatum, is found in Madagascar and in central and western regions of sub-Saharan Africa (Mali, Chad, Niger, Nigeria, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Ghana). It is classically associated with skin, subcutaneous, and bone lesions, but disseminated disease has been described among HIV-positive patients22; because both pathogens coexist in Africa,13,17 it has been suggested that until the correct variety of the fungus has been identified African patients should not be described as affected by “African histoplasmosis.”17; ; In conclusion, our knowledge of the true worldwide distribution of H. capsulatum is still incomplete, and works such as that of Wang and coworkers are worthwhile. Improved access to diagnostic tests and increased awareness of the disease outside the well-known endemic areas will be helpful in redrawing the map of the geographic extent of this infection. Moreover, in an era of increasingly mobile people, physicians need to consider histoplasmosis in travelers and immigrants from the Indian subcontinent and South-east Asia in addition to regions traditionally considered endemic.",90,6,982,983,Epidemiology; Demography; China; Geography; Dimorphic fungus; Penicillium marneffei; Histoplasma; Histoplasmosis; Mycosis; Tuberculosis,,Africa South of the Sahara/epidemiology; Asia/epidemiology; Endemic Diseases; HIV Infections/complications; Histoplasma/isolation & purification; Histoplasmosis/complications; Humans; Madagascar/epidemiology,,,http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4047757 https://paperity.org/p/43907547/histoplasma-capsulatum-more-widespread-than-previously-thought https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24778192,http://dx.doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.14-0175,10.4269/ajtmh.14-0175,2128221704,PMC4047757,0,004-983-375-459-738; 006-366-469-189-109; 011-111-782-518-382; 012-071-257-811-575; 013-957-702-071-915; 018-345-054-495-641; 018-444-438-973-984; 020-199-955-977-92X; 022-606-299-366-052; 025-085-655-966-387; 028-882-165-302-351; 033-010-267-741-876; 045-437-472-616-60X; 047-662-996-199-433; 058-054-845-869-321; 059-036-176-142-80X; 066-039-342-487-836; 078-685-898-201-479; 106-331-745-444-627; 112-137-137-297-828; 128-999-937-404-046; 146-911-557-353-594; 176-633-744-196-839,62,,(doi) 10.4269/ajtmh.14-0175; (magid) 2128221704; (pmcid) pmc4047757; (pmid) 24778192,en

Some have advocated it for adoption/promotion by government as a means of citizen engagement. The objective of this article is to increase the appreciation of the contribution that crowdsourcing can make towards resolving challenges associated with disadvantaged urbanisation in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). We review urban challenges of SSA and three practices of crowdsourcing: volunteered geographic information (VGI), Citizen Science (CS), and Participatory Mapping (PM). Then we examine problems associated with the advocacy for government adoption of those practices in SSA. We argue that civil society collaboration with an international governmental organisation (IGO) instead of government promises a better way of adopting and promoting them. This suggestion is based on the fact that work related to this strategy is carried out by a global coalition of civil society, the UN-NGLS. This strategy promises a more rapid way of taking advantage of fast-tracking public engagement in the economic region, SSA.</jats:p>",36,1,5,14,Government; Development studies; Public engagement; Geography; Disadvantaged; Work related; Public relations; Civil society; Volunteered geographic information; Crowdsourcing,,,,,https://content.sciendo.com/view/journals/quageo/36/1/article-p5.xml?lang=en https://core.ac.uk/display/84272554 https://repozytorium.amu.edu.pl/bitstream/10593/17731/1/QG361_005-014.pdf https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:vrs:quageo:v:36:y:2017:i:1:p:5-14:n:1 https://ideas.repec.org/a/vrs/quageo/v36y2017i1p5-14n1.html https://repozytorium.amu.edu.pl/handle/10593/17731 https://econpapers.repec.org/article/vrsquageo/v_3a36_3ay_3a2017_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a5-14_3an_3a1.htm https://doaj.org/article/189e707c2b4a40cc887864708036ee55,http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/quageo-2017-0001,10.1515/quageo-2017-0001,2596381739,,0,000-030-132-510-991; 002-134-394-473-51X; 008-976-078-444-281; 010-431-970-073-567; 016-163-203-402-85X; 020-516-661-208-953; 023-524-250-266-250; 033-045-346-682-19X; 068-903-508-695-216; 071-341-139-582-035; 071-433-278-233-554; 071-709-562-023-946; 073-989-079-363-192; 078-373-232-712-683; 084-287-043-716-032; 091-129-566-033-628; 096-632-113-198-366; 102-189-247-828-150; 119-885-362-942-705; 120-595-401-337-453; 121-656-341-912-091; 126-595-292-653-219; 141-197-167-588-200; 146-656-433-286-531; 149-176-111-217-417; 152-195-205-132-184; 164-736-685-848-29X; 176-908-883-569-148; 179-043-520-420-634; 186-153-303-697-830,5,,(coreid) 90829966; (magid) 2596381739; (doi) 10.1515/quageo-2017-0001,en

To provide a PNS for the transportation of vulnerable people, more detailed information of pedestrian facilities and obstructions should be included in Pedestrian Network Data (PND) used for PNS. Such data can be constructed efficiently by collecting GPS trajectories and integrating them with the existing PND. However, these two kinds of data have geometric differences and topological inconsistencies that need to be addressed. In this paper, we provide a methodology for integrating pedestrian facilities and obstructions information with an existing PND. At first we extracted the significant points from user-collected GPS trajectory by identifying the geometric difference index and attributes of each point. Then the extracted points were used to make an initial solution of the matching between the trajectory and the PND. Two geometrical algorithms were proposed and applied to reduce two kinds of errors in the matching: on dual lines and on intersections. Using the final solution for the matching, we reconstructed the node/link structure of PND including the facilities and obstructions information. Finally, performance was assessed with a test site and 79.2% of the collected data were correctly integrated with the PND.",15,9,24466,24486,Data mining; Trajectory; Geography; Transport engineering; Pedestrian; Network data; Gps trajectory; Poison control; Geographic information system; Volunteered geographic information; Global Positioning System,facilities and obstructions; pedestrian navigation service; pedestrian network data; transportation of vulnerable people; volunteered geographic information,Algorithms; Facility Design and Construction; Geographic Information Systems; Geography; Humans; Pedestrians; Republic of Korea; Transportation; Vulnerable Populations,,,http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4610553 https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/15/9/24466/pdf https://doi.org/10.3390/s150924466 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26404307 https://core.ac.uk/display/90192235 https://doaj.org/article/4ec3419c4e964c74b33bc13e1d74adf7 https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/15/9/24466/htm https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/sensors/sensors15.html#ParkBY15,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s150924466,10.3390/s150924466,2112314383,PMC4610553,0,002-562-184-174-82X; 037-013-458-850-142; 039-569-689-633-045; 044-042-209-453-302; 055-683-593-663-556; 064-149-288-666-423; 065-306-527-869-432; 080-000-733-841-993; 081-475-350-327-247; 091-418-376-682-249; 093-761-642-113-008; 111-058-780-577-077; 111-364-182-760-088; 116-077-697-924-547; 118-823-466-395-275; 124-091-456-935-481; 134-974-024-599-340; 137-226-468-114-821; 151-677-623-811-978; 185-239-918-204-095,5,"research support, non-u.s. gov't",(pmid) 26404307; (pii) s150924466; (magid) 2112314383; (doi) 10.3390/s150924466; (pmcid) pmc4610553; (coreid) 90192235,en
075-756-952-158-317,Butterfly monitoring using systematically placed transects in contrasting climatic regions - Exploring an established spatial design for sampling,2016-04-13,2016,journal article,Nature Conservation,13146947; 13143301,Pensoft Publishers,Bulgaria,Elin Videvall; Erik Öckinger; Lars B. Pettersson,"Butterfly monitoring schemes are recording programs initiated to monitor nationwide butterfly abundance and distribution patterns, often with help from volunteers. The method generates high-resolution data, but may be associated with a degree of habitat sampling bias if volunteers prefer to survey areas perceived to be high-quality butterfly habitats. This can result in habitats becoming underrepresented in the data set, leading to less information about the butterfly populations there. In the present study, we investigate the possibility of applying a spatial design used by the Swedish Bird Survey for nationwide, gridbased sampling, with a goal to get butterfly monitoring data covering a representative sample of different habitats. We surveyed four 2×2 km sampling squares, split into 100 m segments, in the southernmost region of Sweden (Scania) and four in the northernmost region (Norrbotten). The grid-based transects were compared with volunteer-selected transects in a G IS analysis using a refined Swedish version of CORINE land cover data to see how well these two transect designs represent true habitat coverage. A total of 53 km transect was monitored, resulting in 490 individuals and 29 different species recorded. We found that transect cover correlated significantly with overall land cover using both monitoring methods, though standardised transects outperformed volunteer-selected transects in habitat representation in Scania, but not in Norrbotten. Butterflies were found to aggregate significantly in specific habitats, but with contrasting results for the two geographically different regions. Grasslands in both regions generated a high number of recorded butterflies, although so did clear-cut and residential areas in Norrbotten as well. The highest number of individuals recorded per transect was found in bogs in Scania. This study emphasises the value of complementing free site selection monitoring schemes with spatially representative schemes such as the Swedish Bird Survey, and sheds some light on general habitat preferences for Swedish butterflies in two contrasting climatic regions.

By using location-aware devices such as smartphones to collect geographic information in the form of geo-tagged text, photos, or videos, and sharing this information through online social media, such as Twitter, citizens create Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI). To effectively use this information for disaster management, we developed a VGI framework for the discovery of VGI. This framework consists of four components: (i) a VGI brokering module to provide a standard service interface to retrieve VGI from multiple resources based on spatial, temporal, and semantic parameters; (ii) a VGI quality control component, which employs semantic filtering and cross-referencing techniques to evaluate VGI; (iii) a VGI publisher module, which uses a service-based delivery mechanism to disseminate VGI, and (iv) a VGI discovery component to locate, browse, and query metadata about available VGI datasets. In a case study we employed a FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) strategy, open standards/specifications, and free/open data to show the utility of the framework. We demonstrate that the framework can facilitate data discovery for disaster management. The addition of quality metrics and a single aggregated source of relevant crisis VGI will allow users to make informed policy choices that could save lives, meet basic humanitarian needs earlier, and perhaps limit environmental and economic damage",4,3,1389,1422,Dissemination; World Wide Web; Interoperability; Geography; Data discovery; Social media; Volunteered geographic information; Emergency management; Open standard; Metadata,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ijgi/ijgi4.html#PooraziziHS15 https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi4031389 https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/4/3/1389 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015IJGI....4.1389P/abstract http://repositorio.conicyt.cl/handle/10533/239321 https://www.scilit.net/article/28ad348669e08906e606a4a80b71df9e https://core.ac.uk/display/89584409 https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/4/3/1389/pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi4031389,10.3390/ijgi4031389,2136209984,,0,000-967-721-739-893; 002-128-419-035-866; 002-617-979-256-162; 004-288-931-757-177; 005-374-785-075-748; 006-612-965-080-699; 007-561-246-860-006; 009-808-694-627-640; 010-136-645-510-231; 010-242-782-778-938; 010-346-147-444-222; 010-717-499-155-598; 011-483-783-342-136; 012-800-182-556-369; 013-036-280-323-441; 013-321-433-085-185; 013-803-494-618-557; 013-840-735-483-642; 014-425-368-123-634; 014-845-068-774-33X; 015-856-606-226-235; 018-654-886-499-425; 021-074-586-154-668; 021-373-554-453-794; 023-036-742-444-209; 026-398-756-705-059; 030-416-570-557-01X; 031-797-929-547-669; 032-580-093-386-963; 034-671-172-365-649; 040-155-905-622-611; 040-184-564-272-635; 040-267-517-107-219; 040-929-519-033-153; 043-841-873-549-438; 047-241-224-748-118; 051-153-532-021-345; 057-327-207-349-799; 057-545-918-303-995; 058-216-006-652-219; 064-463-972-851-444; 065-202-191-625-007; 065-810-085-182-782; 066-063-405-473-897; 067-341-125-020-782; 081-338-611-332-52X; 082-291-165-855-187; 085-905-505-231-155; 087-450-915-611-331; 097-612-174-011-049; 100-866-038-545-202; 103-859-285-040-344; 106-448-322-707-084; 106-919-166-865-846; 108-315-748-664-337; 110-407-909-758-386; 111-163-933-663-414; 112-436-957-441-055; 113-820-258-037-611; 113-908-285-525-369; 114-182-315-647-17X; 118-057-611-878-127; 122-468-378-044-732; 124-058-372-643-823; 125-441-816-837-695; 127-108-599-312-22X; 129-937-389-422-544; 130-359-280-279-813; 130-384-601-436-117; 131-356-259-197-779; 136-916-175-082-389; 140-167-476-216-060; 143-957-295-030-748; 150-597-705-102-79X; 158-847-532-778-731; 159-147-291-318-10X; 164-980-081-069-687; 165-737-834-639-303; 166-615-109-855-880; 168-321-638-734-354; 168-613-788-020-271; 171-544-875-588-246; 185-701-246-919-65X; 187-495-968-736-386; 187-510-780-643-658; 195-019-623-135-107; 198-122-408-150-421,14,,(doi) 10.3390/ijgi4031389; (magid) 2136209984; (coreid) 89584409,en; es

Murphy; Karen S. Schlumpf; David J. Wright; Ritchard G. Cable; John D. Roback; Ronald A. Sacher; Michael P. Busch,"Obesity has been described as epidemic in the USA, with significant adverse consequences for the incidence of diabetes and CVD, premature mortality and reduced quality of life(1–3). According to National Center for Health Statistics data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2007–2008, obesity prevalence by age was: 27·5 % in men and 34·0 % in women for ages 20–39 years; 34·3 % in men and 38·2 % in women for ages 40–59 years; and 37·1 % in men and 33·6 % in women for ages 60 years and above(4). That study noted that the upward trend of obesity observed in the US population over the past 30 years may be levelling off in the decade since 1999–2000. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have also used self-reported height and weight data from the US Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) to estimate county-level prevalence of obesity. Counties with the highest prevalence of obesity were concentrated in West Virginia, the Appalachian counties of Tennessee and Kentucky, much of the Mississippi Delta, and the southern belt extending across Louisiana, Mississippi, middle Alabama, south Georgia and the coastal regions of the Carolinas(5). However the authors noted limitations of both national surveillance mechanisms, including small sample size in sex and age strata for NHANES and potential response bias in the BRFSS.; ; Despite a moderate degree of selection bias due to volunteer bias and health criteria, blood donors provide a potential population for the ongoing surveillance of obesity and other health-related risk factors. Certainly such data have been useful in surveillance for HIV and West Nile virus(6,7). Data on large numbers of individuals are available from across the USA, and data are available continuously as opposed to episodic surveys. We are not aware of published data on BMI distributions among blood donors. Such information may be useful for public health surveillance, and also because body mass criteria are used to define eligibility for certain types of blood collection (e.g. double red cell donation) and prevention of syncopal reactions.; ; We therefore used data from a large, multicentre consortium of US blood centres to perform a descriptive analysis of BMI. Although the prevalence of obesity was modestly lower among blood donors compared with the general US population, demographic and geographic differences were observed that may be useful to ongoing public health surveillance.",15,6,964,971,Public health; Cross-sectional study; Demography; Public health surveillance; Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System; National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey; Body mass index; Population; Obesity; Medicine; Gerontology,,Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Blood Donors; Blood Platelets; Body Mass Index; Cross-Sectional Studies; Educational Status; Erythrocytes; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Hispanic Americans; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Nutrition Surveys; Obesity/epidemiology; Prevalence; United States/epidemiology; Young Adult,,NHLBI NIH HHS (N01-HB-47172) United States; NHLBI NIH HHS (N01-HB-47171) United States; NHLBI NIH HHS (N01-HB-47170) United States; NHLBI NIH HHS (N01-HB-47175) United States; NHLBI NIH HHS (N01-HB-47174) United States; NHLBI NIH HHS (N01-HB-47168) United States; NHLBI NIH HHS (N01-HB-57181) United States; NHLBI NIH HHS (N01-HB-47169) United States; NHLBI NIH HHS (N01HB47168) United States; NHLBI NIH HHS (N01 HB047174) United States,http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3518631 https://www.researchgate.net/profile/John_Roback/publication/221733976_BMI_and_obesity_in_US_blood_donors_a_potential_public_health_role_for_the_blood_centre/links/02e7e52bc7054f36d4000000.pdf https://open.library.emory.edu/publications/emory:trbd1/ https://escholarship.org/uc/item/7mb3v328 https://escholarship.org/uc/item/7mb3v328.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22230364,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s1368980011003405,10.1017/s1368980011003405,2063153502,PMC3518631,0,017-856-617-719-046; 023-994-492-351-50X; 024-382-904-431-071; 028-321-724-568-229; 028-770-762-188-968; 036-734-945-131-640; 038-918-790-120-929; 047-173-993-808-128; 049-494-097-502-075; 051-326-137-504-462; 054-889-710-995-080; 065-542-856-734-197; 068-476-171-348-02X; 071-142-223-250-330; 077-008-499-193-569; 086-162-060-178-794; 086-468-145-176-079; 091-892-011-533-206; 092-182-105-308-27X; 103-364-355-637-855; 111-704-833-241-694; 123-681-872-193-855; 130-618-691-821-244; 135-187-971-085-341; 182-906-916-003-676; 195-538-498-590-921,11,"research support, n.i.h., extramural",(pmcid) pmc3518631; (pii) s1368980011003405; (magid) 2063153502; (doi) 10.1017/s1368980011003405; (pmid) 22230364,en

IPM has been deployed to achieve the judicious use of pesticides and has become one of the most important methods of securing agricultural productivity. Despite the efforts made to strengthen IPM during the past decades, overuse as well as indiscriminate use of pesticides is still common. This problem is particularly serious in underserved farming communities which suffer from ineffectiveness with respect to pest management information collection and dissemination. The recent development of volunteered geographic information (VGI) offers an opportunity to the general public to create and receive ubiquitous, cost-effective, and timely geospatial information. Therefore, this study proposes to enhance IPM through establishing a VGI-based IPM. As a starting point of this line of research, this study explored how such geospatial information can contribute to IPM enhancement. Based on this, a conceptual framework of VGI interaction was built to guide the establishment of VGI-based IPM. To implement VGI-based IPM, a mobile phone platform was developed. In addition, a case study was conducted in the town of Shuibian in Jiangxi province of China to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. In the case study, by analyzing infestation incidents of an overwintering outbreak of striped rice stem borers voluntarily reported by farmers through mobile phones, spatiotemporal infestation patterns of the borers throughout the study area were revealed and disseminated to the farmers. These patterns include the dates and degree-days the pest infestations intensified, and the orientation or spatial structural variations of the clustering of the infestations. This case study showcased the unique merit of VGI in enhancing IPM, namely the acquisition of previously unrecorded spatial data in a cost-effective and real-time manner for discovering and disseminating previously unknown pest management knowledge.",6,7,224,,Dissemination; Agriculture; Integrated pest management; Agricultural productivity; Conceptual framework; Ecology; Geography; Mobile phone; Volunteered geographic information; Environmental planning; Geospatial analysis,,,,,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi6070224 https://core.ac.uk/display/88087847 https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/6/7/224 https://katalog.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/titel/68204787 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ijgi/ijgi6.html#YanFC17 https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/6/7/224/pdf http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017IJGI....6..224Y/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi6070224,10.3390/ijgi6070224,2738676247,,0,000-414-362-052-458; 000-762-412-801-711; 005-041-300-965-780; 005-374-785-075-748; 010-414-248-858-792; 010-469-991-531-778; 011-014-349-482-329; 011-260-759-259-596; 014-973-308-579-936; 016-452-094-119-828; 018-887-354-957-373; 019-793-188-962-159; 020-910-316-459-423; 021-967-977-229-629; 029-337-982-134-645; 034-296-402-405-270; 039-492-204-421-368; 046-894-548-790-760; 047-900-507-636-956; 055-023-741-279-131; 057-545-918-303-995; 059-960-067-054-054; 061-321-614-509-398; 063-599-343-217-316; 065-648-164-120-245; 065-779-566-608-032; 065-901-701-123-617; 070-809-999-659-594; 075-176-377-392-930; 075-836-571-031-160; 077-662-771-853-906; 078-460-486-926-118; 078-715-695-348-758; 081-235-270-322-291; 082-569-388-570-123; 083-527-759-306-323; 086-196-245-751-53X; 091-204-512-390-272; 091-444-619-072-795; 094-558-912-336-23X; 097-612-174-011-049; 099-554-177-937-760; 100-120-230-982-09X; 102-160-469-693-977; 103-092-770-961-568; 103-859-285-040-344; 109-227-276-752-73X; 117-900-767-404-155; 120-333-241-220-36X; 125-537-602-928-897; 130-781-385-192-320; 134-211-701-905-646; 147-511-124-583-697; 147-539-342-970-008; 147-826-896-424-422; 147-848-554-456-210; 158-847-532-778-731,9,,(doi) 10.3390/ijgi6070224; (coreid) 88087847; (magid) 2738676247,en

With the development of location-based services and the rapid increase in volunteered geographic information and social media data, the amount of point data is increasing day by day, resulting in inevitable problems of overlay and congestion during visualization. Map generalization provides multiple algorithms that can be used to select, aggregate and make typification of points or point clusters. For the generalization of point data, however, the traditional stand-alone computing environment has difficulty with real-time realization. Currently, the rapid development of cloud computing technology provides a powerful support for improving the efficiency of map generalization. However, compared with the stand-alone environment, the data decomposition and the real-time display of point generalization in the cloud platform imposes higher requirements on the point generalization constraints, which play an important role in point-generalized process control. Based on the computational characteristics of the cloud platform, this paper analyzes the changes in point generalization constraints. In addition, our work proposes the constraints of point generalization based on the cloud platform and its construction method, builds a prototype system based on the Hadoop cloud platform. Our prototype system is tested using typical experimental data. Its efficiency and the quality of its results is examined. The results show that the efficiency and quality of point selection can be significantly improved by controlling the point generalization process with the generalization constraints in the cloud computing environment proposed in this paper. This paper provides a possible way for the realization of map generalization in the cloud computing environment. Its usability with real data and with many users accessing it will be the focus of further research.",7,7,235,,Distributed computing; Overlay; Process control; Spatial analysis; Usability; Cartographic generalization; Visualization; Computer science; Volunteered geographic information; Cloud computing,,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi7070235 https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/7/7/235/pdf https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018IJGI....7..235Z/abstract https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ijgi/ijgi7.html#ZhouSYYSS18 https://www.muni.cz/vyzkum/publikace/1421878 https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/7/7/235,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi7070235,10.3390/ijgi7070235,2808988911,,0,000-406-424-276-810; 006-303-542-488-503; 012-866-772-957-228; 014-706-992-823-125; 014-986-823-168-819; 026-020-012-667-403; 031-603-344-707-171; 031-724-721-693-977; 033-222-825-921-797; 039-342-825-070-237; 039-828-886-936-460; 045-361-727-356-339; 047-718-659-788-819; 065-528-331-282-123; 067-186-110-684-79X; 076-036-191-181-571; 078-495-706-466-96X; 084-039-979-841-188; 090-750-855-239-023; 112-816-782-173-275; 118-313-601-128-170; 158-874-305-640-138,2,,(magid) 2808988911; (doi) 10.3390/ijgi7070235,en

The practice of private citizens generating online geospatial data presents new opportunities for the creation and dissemination of disaster-related geographic data from a dense network of intelligent observers. VGI technologies enable rapid sharing of diverse geographic information for disaster management at a fraction of the resource costs associated with traditional data collection and dissemination, but they also present new challenges. These include a lack of data quality assurance and issues surrounding data management, liability, security, and the digital divide. There is a growing need for researchers to explore and understand the implications of these data and data practices for disaster management. In this article, we review the current state of knowledge in this emerging field and present recommendations for future research. Significantly, we note further research is warranted in the pre-event phases of disaster management, where VGI may present an opportunity to connect and engage individuals in disaster preparation and strengthen community resilience to potential disaster events.

Pereira,"Abstract Over the last few years, much online volunteered geographic information (VGI) has emerged and has been increasingly analyzed to understand places and cities, as well as human mobility and activity. However, there are concerns about the quality and usability of such VGI. In this study, we demonstrate a complete process that comprises the collection, unification, classification and validation of a type of VGI—online point-of-interest (POI) data—and develop methods to utilize such POI data to estimate disaggregated land use (i.e., employment size by category) at a very high spatial resolution (census block level) using part of the Boston metropolitan area as an example. With recent advances in activity-based land use, transportation, and environment (LUTE) models, such disaggregated land use data become important to allow LUTE models to analyze and simulate a person’s choices of work location and activity destinations and to understand policy impacts on future cities. These data can also be used as alternatives to explore economic activities at the local level, especially as government-published census-based disaggregated employment data have become less available in the recent decade. Our new approach provides opportunities for cities to estimate land use at high resolution with low cost by utilizing VGI while ensuring its quality with a certain accuracy threshold. The automatic classification of POI can also be utilized for other types of analyses on cities.",53,,36,46,Data mining; Point of interest; Metropolitan area; Usability; Information extraction; Geography; Data science; Destinations; Land use; Volunteered geographic information; Social network,,,,Singapore National Research Foundation (NRF),http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0198971514001355 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0198971514001355 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2014.12.001 https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2014.12.001 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/urban/urban53.html#JiangARFP15 http://fprodrigues.com/publications/mining-point-of-interest-data-from-social-networks-for-urban-land-use-classification-and-disaggregation/ https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/78063151.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2014.12.001,10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2014.12.001,2202958134,,0,008-655-662-451-459; 009-869-849-569-57X; 027-873-664-461-647; 034-917-882-212-003; 044-801-465-338-965; 046-128-839-855-939; 047-001-289-608-164; 048-972-231-931-311; 053-662-324-770-147; 055-716-862-578-906; 074-506-843-122-456; 083-345-645-020-792; 091-471-298-569-066; 094-336-360-386-20X; 096-603-327-420-505; 139-594-719-019-100; 150-892-284-828-278; 161-698-962-852-50X; 164-530-168-241-533; 177-398-742-252-920; 180-354-955-200-300; 195-411-876-432-915; 196-577-895-358-198,105,,(coreid) 78063151; (doi) 10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2014.12.001; (magid) 2202958134,en

To further this aim, a collaborative, modular, and information and communications technology-based Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) called SIRENE—Sistema Informativo per la Preparazione e la Risposta alle Emergenze (Information System for Emergency Preparedness and Response) is designed and implemented to access and share, over the Internet, relevant multisource and distributed geospatial data to support decision makers in reducing disaster risks. SIRENE flexibly searches and retrieves strategic information from local and/or remote repositories to cope with different emergency phases. The system collects, queries, and analyzes geographic information provided voluntarily by observers directly in the field (volunteered geographic information (VGI) reports) to identify potentially critical environmental conditions. SIRENE can visualize and cross-validate institutional and research-based data against VGI reports, as well as provide disaster managers with a decision support system able to suggest the mode and timing of intervention, before and in the aftermath of different types of emergencies, on the basis of the available information and in agreement with the laws in force at the national and regional levels. Testing installations of SIRENE have been deployed in 18 hilly or mountain municipalities (12 located in the Italian Central Alps of northern Italy, and six in the Umbria region of central Italy), which have been affected by natural hazard-induced disasters over the past years (landslides, debris flows, floods, and wildfire) and experienced significant social and economic losses.",9,1,129,142,Decision support system; Environmental resource management; Business; Information system; Spatial data infrastructure; Natural hazard; Volunteered geographic information; Emergency management; Information and Communications Technology; Geospatial analysis,,,,,https://paperity.org/p/85982188/sirene-a-spatial-data-infrastructure-to-enhance-communities-resilience-to-disaster https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s13753-018-0160-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13753-018-0160-2,10.1007/s13753-018-0160-2,2793284864,,0,002-128-419-035-866; 023-036-742-444-209; 036-431-775-434-754; 042-181-295-266-315; 042-442-573-204-273; 044-866-772-690-384; 057-545-918-303-995; 069-917-247-291-742; 075-179-108-062-152; 075-713-216-907-850; 077-359-667-382-102; 078-460-486-926-118; 091-204-512-390-272; 094-799-911-440-278; 095-164-187-963-605; 097-612-174-011-049; 106-915-869-274-024; 111-811-300-036-763; 113-430-885-959-769; 116-502-661-691-598; 137-189-237-668-851; 171-603-091-805-932; 183-146-364-156-312; 184-629-214-291-466; 194-737-304-885-867,6,,(doi) 10.1007/s13753-018-0160-2; (magid) 2793284864,en

The rapid emergence of web-based services has facilitated the collection, dissemination, and cartographic representation of spatial information from the public, giving rise to the idea of using Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) to aid disaster management. In this study, with a brief review on the concept and the development of disaster management, opportunities and challenges for applying VGI in disaster management were explored. The challenges, including Data availability, Data quality, Data management and Legal issues of using VGI for disaster management, were discussed in detail with particular emphasis on the actual needs of disaster management practice in China. Three different approaches to assure VGI data quality, namely the classification and authority design of volunteers, a government-led VGI data acquisition framework for disaster management and a quality assessment system for VGI, respectively, were presented and discussed. As a case study, a prototype of VGI oriented earthquake disaster databank & sharing platform, an open WebGIS system for volunteers and other interested individuals collaboratively create and manage the earthquake disaster related information, was proposed, to provide references for improving the level of earthquake emergency response and disaster mitigation in China.",57,1,012015,,Environmental resource management; Government; Spatial analysis; Data management; Geography; Data quality; Data availability; Earthquake disaster; Knowledge management; Volunteered geographic information; Emergency management,,,,,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1755-1315/57/1/012015/meta https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1755-1315/57/1/012015/pdf http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017E&ES...57a2015C/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/57/1/012015,10.1088/1755-1315/57/1/012015,2594327113,,0,014-425-368-123-634; 016-249-209-356-740; 040-184-564-272-635; 047-716-734-278-212; 057-545-918-303-995; 065-213-464-431-763; 091-383-939-895-049; 104-591-128-843-065; 106-919-166-865-846; 143-957-295-030-748; 175-288-997-167-437; 198-122-408-150-421,5,,(magid) 2594327113; (doi) 10.1088/1755-1315/57/1/012015,en

Geographic information systems mapping software was used to illustrate health disparities in Alachua County, FL; galvanize a community response; and direct reallocation of resources.; ; The University of Florida Family Data Center created “hot spot” density maps of important health and social indicators to highlight the location of disparities at the neighborhood level. Maps were produced for Medicaid births, teen births, low birth weight, domestic violence incidents, child maltreatment reports, unexcused school absences, and juvenile justice referrals. Maps were widely shared with community partners, including local elected officials, law enforcement, educators, child welfare agencies, health care providers, and service organizations. This data sharing resulted in advocacy efforts to bring resources to the greatest-need neighborhoods in the county. Novel public-private partnerships were forged between the local library district, children and family service providers, and university administrators. Two major changes are detailed: a family resource center built in the neighborhood of greatest need and a mobile clinic staffed by physicians, nurses, physician assistants, health educators, and student and faculty volunteers.; ; Density maps have several advantages.

Since contributors have diverse perspectives about items, information integration in OSM might be considered as a type of multi-representation information combination. As due to freely availability of crowdsourced data quantity and quality assurance are two major areas to concern. This work introduces the design and development of a framework for identifying errors in crowdsourced map data, which enables volunteers to edit and tag geospatial and geographic data. Completeness, a quality parameter is used to investigate different types of errors. Initially Web-based framework is established, which includes a set of components to display the geospatial map data, indicators, markers to highlight or identify errors, as the establishment of the labeling framework. Based on this approach a prototype is developed and implemented in experiments. To actually fix the errors on OpenStreetMap, after completing the fix, it is sent back to OpenStreetMap.

Several studies address VGI quality from various perspectives like completeness, positional accuracy, consistency, etc. They mostly have consensus on the heterogeneity of data quality. The problem may be due to the lack of standard procedures for data collection and absence of quality control feedback for voluntary participants. In our research, we are concerned with data quality from the classification perspective. Particularly in VGI-mapping projects, the limited expertise of participants and the non-strict definition of geographic features lead to conceptual overlapping classes, where an entity could plausibly belong to multiple classes, e.g., lake or pond, park or garden, marsh or swamp, etc. Usually, quantitative and/or qualitative characteristics exist that distinguish between classes. Nevertheless, these characteristics might not be recognizable for non-expert participants. In previous work, we developed the rule-guided classification approach that guides participants to the most appropriate classes. As exemplification, we tackle the conceptual overlapping of some grass-related classes. For a given data set, our approach presents the most highly recommended classes for each entity. In this paper, we present the validation of our approach. We implement a web-based application called Grass&amp;Green that presents recommendations for crowdsourcing validation. The findings show the applicability of the proposed approach. In four months, the application attracted 212 participants from more than 35 countries who checked 2,865 entities. The results indicate that 89% of the contributions fully/partially agree with our recommendations. We then carried out a detailed analysis that demonstrates the potential of this enhanced data classification. This research encourages the development of customized applications that target a particular geographic feature",5,6,87,,Exemplification; Data mining; Data collection; Geography; Data quality; Data science; Data classification; Geographic feature; Completeness (statistics); Volunteered geographic information; Crowdsourcing,,,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/5/6/87 https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/5/6/87/pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/90065134 https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi5060087 https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi5060087 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ijgi/ijgi5.html#AliSZM16 https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/6491071 http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi5060087,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi5060087,10.3390/ijgi5060087,2416782422,,0,003-977-353-560-715; 006-057-019-890-636; 006-408-131-340-003; 007-857-101-229-718; 008-655-662-451-459; 008-714-358-699-609; 010-390-048-140-045; 013-445-037-365-411; 013-516-235-069-82X; 013-803-494-618-557; 014-425-368-123-634; 016-588-276-860-652; 022-473-450-579-960; 024-821-361-583-23X; 027-666-068-785-379; 029-963-409-674-751; 030-720-889-846-223; 030-975-962-975-895; 031-636-768-715-141; 036-045-596-267-027; 038-976-596-179-447; 040-267-517-107-219; 041-793-028-069-027; 048-702-561-381-148; 051-285-080-856-898; 052-691-153-784-54X; 057-545-918-303-995; 058-444-759-259-280; 059-506-034-265-023; 065-164-571-094-485; 071-490-604-491-921; 077-948-833-265-012; 078-715-695-348-758; 086-329-388-138-19X; 086-758-442-428-039; 088-322-116-963-517; 088-339-711-439-200; 092-381-912-924-636; 097-338-432-344-323; 097-612-174-011-049; 097-773-332-306-457; 100-635-968-014-055; 104-778-148-692-196; 106-264-944-278-433; 109-754-051-595-635; 130-700-123-619-585; 145-350-454-429-564; 147-556-132-605-103; 150-682-937-572-48X; 171-544-875-588-246; 198-122-408-150-421,12,,(coreid) 90065134; (magid) 2416782422; (doi) 10.3390/ijgi5060087,en

The NMAs varied greatly in their engagement with the community generating volunteered geographic information (VGI) and in their future plans. From an assessment of NMA standard practices, it was evident that much VGI was acquired with a positional accuracy that, while less than that typically acquired by NMAs, actually exceeded the requirements of the nominal data capture scale used by most NMAs. Opportunities for VGI use in map revision and updating were evident, especially for agencies that use a continuous rather than cyclical updating policy. Some NMAs had also developed systems to engage with citizen sensors and examples are discussed. Only rarely was VGI used to collect data on features beyond the standard set used by the NMAs. The potential role of citizen sensing and so its current scale of use by NMAs is limited by a series of concerns, notably relating to issues of data quality, the nature and motivation of the contributors, legal issues, the sustainability of data source, and employment fears of NMA staff.

Computer Science for Environmental Protection,18684238; 1868422x,Springer International Publishing,Germany,Simon Burkard; Frank Fuchs-Kittowski; Anna O’Faoláin de Bhróithe,"Flood forecasting is particularly difficult and uncertain for small drainage basins. One reason for this is due to inadequate temporal and spatial hydrological input variables for model-based flood predictions. Incorporating additional information collected by volunteers with the help of their smartphones can improve flood forecasting systems. Data collected in this way is often referred to VGI data (Volunteered Geographic Information data). This paper discusses how this information can be incorporated into a flood forecasting system to support flood management in small drainage basins on the basis of mobile VGI data. It therefore outlines the main functional components involved in such a VGI-based flood forecasting platform while presenting the component for mobile data acquisition (mobile sensing) in more detail. In this context, relevant measurement variables are first introduced and then suitable methods for recording these data with mobile devices are described. The focus of the paper lies on discussing various methods for measuring the water level using inbuilt smartphone sensors. For this purpose, three different image-based methods for measuring the water level at the banks of small rivers using a mobile device and the inbuilt orientation and camera sensors are explained in detail. It is shown that performing the measurements with the user’s help via appropriate user interaction and utilising known structures at the measuring points results in a rather robust image-based measurement of the water level. A preliminary evaluation of the methods under ideal conditions found that the developed measurement techniques can achieve both an accuracy and precision of less than 1 cm.",,,124,138,Drainage basin; Flood forecasting; Mobile device; Computer science; Volunteered geographic information; Drainage; Flood myth; Image sensor; Mobile broadband; Real-time computing,,,,,https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-89935-0_11 https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-319-89935-0_11 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/isess/isess2017.html#BurkardFB17 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-89935-0_11,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-89935-0_11,10.1007/978-3-319-89935-0_11,2800158595,,0,004-288-931-757-177; 005-374-785-075-748; 010-651-662-149-085; 011-375-793-222-041; 018-242-122-507-076; 032-903-495-847-439; 039-039-109-120-799; 040-184-564-272-635; 040-649-829-362-335; 047-912-702-361-474; 050-156-351-021-685; 060-716-274-159-466; 072-243-912-426-29X; 080-397-338-183-407; 091-245-600-784-221; 101-996-182-153-862; 102-160-469-693-977; 108-402-698-579-593; 109-227-276-752-73X; 112-160-486-845-074; 128-630-302-259-009; 131-459-418-310-524; 131-460-759-496-53X; 151-345-044-035-600; 153-183-194-155-492,3,,(magid) 2800158595; (doi) 10.1007/978-3-319-89935-0_11,en

On the basis of a review of recent interrogations of the (Public) Participatory Geographic Information Systems (P)PGIS and Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) approaches, a summary of five prevailing principles in participatory spatial information handling is presented. We investigate these five principles that are common to (P)PGIS and VGI on the basis of a framework of two dimensions that govern the participatory use of spatial information from the perspective of people and society. This framework is presented as a shared perspective of (P)PGIS and VGI and illustrates that, although both share many of these same principles, the ways in which these principles are approached are highly diverse.

They are also characterized by diverging perceptions and interests of citizens and stakeholders. Thus, in the arena of urban planning, we are in need of approaches that are able to cope not only with urban complexity but also allow for participatory and collaborative processes to empower citizens. This to create democratic cities. Connected to the field of smart cities and citizens, we present in this paper, the prototype of an urban digital twin for the 30,000-people town of Herrenberg in Germany. Urban digital twins are sophisticated data models allowing for collaborative processes. The herein presented prototype comprises (1) a 3D model of the built environment, (2) a street network model using the theory and method of space syntax, (3) an urban mobility simulation, (4) a wind flow simulation, and (5) a number of empirical quantitative and qualitative data using volunteered geographic information (VGI). In addition, the urban digital twin was implemented in a visualization platform for virtual reality and was presented to the general public during diverse public participatory processes, as well as in the framework of the “Morgenstadt Werkstatt” (Tomorrow’s Cities Workshop). The results of a survey indicated that this method and technology could significantly aid in participatory and collaborative processes. Further understanding of how urban digital twins support urban planners, urban designers, and the general public as a collaboration and communication tool and for decision support allows us to be more intentional when creating smart cities and sustainable cities with the help of digital twins.

082-611-612-563-435,Canine parvovirus type 2b is the most prevalent genomic variant strain found in parvovirus antigen positive diarrheic dog feces samples across Canada.,,2016,journal article,The Canadian veterinary journal = La revue veterinaire canadienne,00085286,Canadian Veterinary Medical Association,Canada,Carl A. Gagnon; Véronique Allard; Guillaume Cloutier,"In 1978 an emerging virus, called canine parvovirus (CPV) was identified in the dog population; this virus was subsequently named CPV type 2 (CPV-2). The CPV-2 was distinct from the well-known parvovirus, canine minute virus (CnMV), which was formerly known as canine parvovirus type 1 (1). The CPV-2 virus induced hemorrhagic enteritis, severe diarrhea, vomiting, and leukopenia associated with a high mortality in infected dogs and spread into non-immune dog populations worldwide causing a pandemic. Furthermore, CPV-2 was responsible for myocarditis in puppies. Today, the prevalence of CPV antibodies in adult dogs is high due to vaccination and/or natural infection causing a high protective immunity status. Nevertheless, non-immune puppies that are 6 wk to 6 mo old are susceptible to CPV infection when there is loss of passive protection from maternal-derived antibodies (MDA), which are able to protect puppies against myocarditis (2).; ; The CPV-2 virus belongs to the virus family Parvoviridae, subfamily Parvovirinae (which infect vertebrates) and genus Parvovirus (3). A small non-enveloped single-stranded DNA virus, COV-2 is about 25 nm in size (1). The CPV-2 genome is 5.2 kilo bases (kb) long and possesses at least 2 major open reading frames (ORFs) (4). In the conventional orientation, the right-hand ORF encodes the viral capsid proteins VP1 and VP2, which are the main antigens that induce protective antibodies (5–7). The left-hand ORF encodes the non-structural proteins NS1 and NS2 (8). Since the emergence of CPV-2, several viral genomic variants have emerged due to a surprisingly high substitution rate in the CPV genome, similar to those of RNA viruses (1,9). At least 4 genomic variants have been described and officially recognized: the initial emerging CPV was named CPV-2, and was followed shortly after by CPV-2a in 1979, CPV-2b in 1984, and CPV-2c in 2000 (1). These CPV variants are differentiated through single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located at the VP2 gene (10). The prevalence of CPV variants is geographically restricted and has evolved over time (1,10). To our knowledge, the prevalence of CPV genomic variants in Canada is not known. Thus, the main objective of the present study was to determine the prevalence of CPV genomic variants within the Canadian diarrheic dog population.; ; Canadian veterinarian volunteers submitted feces from diarrheic animals that were previously confirmed to be positive for CPV antigen after local testing by any commercially available capture antigen assay such as the SNAP® Parvo Test (IDEXX Laboratories, Westbrook, Maine, USA). The CPV vaccination status of diarrheic animals was requested and fecal samples of dogs that were known to be recently vaccinated (within the last 30 d) were excluded from the study. It has been recently reported that animals that are vaccinated with a live attenuated vaccine may shed the vaccine strain for up to 21 d post-vaccination, as established by CPV real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) (11). Thus, a delay of 30 d post-vaccination for CPV genotyping was sufficient to circumvent the effects of vaccine strains.; ; Samples from 49 cases were included in this study. These samples were submitted over a 3-year period (from September 27, 2012 until August 21, 2015) and originated from 7 provinces (Table 1). Genotyping of CPV variants was performed by the concomitant analysis of 3 multiplex qPCR assays using minor groove binder (MGB) probes technology as previously described (12,13) but with minor modifications. These MGB probes allow SNP discrimination of the ORF encoding the VP2 protein and therefore allow genotyping of strains. Briefly, about 1 g of feces was suspended in 5 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Nucleic acid extraction was performed on supernatants or directly on vaccine formulations (Duramune®Max Pv and Nobivac®Canine 3-DAPv which contain the CPV-2b and CPV-2 variants, respectively, as positive controls) with either the QIAamp cador Pathogen Mini Kit (Qiagen, Toronto, Ontario) or the BioSprint 96 One-For-All vet kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Thereafter, the 3 multiplex qPCR assays were carried out in a 25-μL volume containing 5 μL template or control DNA, 12.5 μL of QuantiTect Probe PCR buffer 2× (Qiagen), 3 pmol of TET-labeled probe, and 1.25 μL of a 20× mixture consisting of forward and reverse primers and the FAM-labeled probe. The qPCR assays were performed on either a SmartCycler (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, California, USA) or a Rotor-Gene (Qiagen) thermal cycler. The first multiplex qPCR assay targeted the change from adenine to guanine at position 4062 (SNP A4062G in GenBank reference strain {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""M38245"",""term_id"":""333442"",""term_text"":""M38245""}}M38245) that distinquishes between CPV-2a and 2b variants, while the second multiplex qPCR assay targeted the thymine to adenine change at position 4064 (SNP T4064A) that differentiates CPV-2b and 2c variants. As previously reported, the first multiplex qPCR assay could not properly discriminate CPV-2 and 2a variants. Thus, a third multiplex qPCR assay targeting SNP T3088C was developed to ensure discrimination between the CPV-2 variant and all 3 other variants. Taken together, these 3 multiplex qPCR assays allow reliable and fast CPV genotyping results.; ; ; ; Table 1; ; Prevalence of canine parvovirus type 2 genomic variants in feces of diarrheic dogs; ; ; ; As shown in Table 1, the CPV-2b variant was the most prevalent in all 7 provinces from which the samples were obtained. The prevalence of CPV-2b between the different provinces varied from 85.7% to 100%. Overall, the Canadian CPV-2b prevalence was 89.8%. This finding was surprising because CPV-2c was reported to be the most prevalent variant in the United States (US) since 2007, varying between 48.1 and 73.5% (14,15). In contrast, only 1 sample (originating from Ontario) was positive for CPV-2c variant in the current study (Table 1). The CPV-2c virus has an overall Canadian prevalence of 2%, which is much lower than its prevalence in the United States. Four samples were positive for the CPV-2a variant and originated from 3 provinces: Alberta, British Columbia, and Quebec. Thus, CPV-2a has an overall Canadian prevalence of 8.2% (Table 1). As expected, no CPV-2 variant was detected, as it is considered to be extinct (Table 1).; ; Vaccination could significantly affect the genotyping of CPV as attenuated vaccine strains could be shed in feces (11); information on vaccination status was therefore requested for the submitted samples. Unfortunately, the vaccination status of 7 animals (i.e., 14.3% of the fecal samples) was unknown (data not shown). Even if those 7 cases are excluded from our analyses, the CPV-2b variant remained the most prevalent variant found in diarrheic dogs with a value of 90.5% (data not shown). Interestingly, 19 diarrheic animals were reported by veterinarians to be vaccinated and at least 3 different commercial vaccines had been used to vaccinate these animals (data not shown). Only 1 of these animals (5.3%), however, seems to have been vaccinated according to the equivalent guidelines of the American Animal Hospital Association (AAHA) and the World Small Animal Veterinary Association (WSAVA). These guidelines are: “Puppies with poor MDA may be vulnerable (and capable of responding to vaccination) at an earlier age, while others may possess MDA at such high titres that they are incapable of responding to vaccination until ≥ 12 weeks of age. No single primary vaccination policy will therefore cover all possible situations. Thus, puppies should be vaccinated every 3–4 weeks between the ages of 6 and 16 weeks (e.g., at 6, 10, and 14 weeks, or 8, 12, and 16 weeks). To minimize the risk of MDA interference with vaccination, the final dose of the initial series should be administered between 14 and 16 weeks of age, regardless of the product used” (16,17). Thus, at least 83.7% (n = 41) of the diarrheic animals of this study were not or were improperly vaccinated (data not shown) because they received only 1 or 2 doses or the last puppy booster was given before 14 wk of age. Three of the vaccinated animals received 3 injections of vaccine as recommended by AAHA and WSAVA but surprisingly, the last booster injection was given before 14 wk of age (data not shown).; ; Canadian veterinarians should encourage pet owners to allow vaccination of their puppies following the AAHA and WSAVA guidelines. Several reports have demonstrated a very good efficacy of CPV vaccines in the context of homologous and heterologous challenges (10,17). Our results may have indicated a vaccination failure in 1 vaccinated animal but it might be explained by errors included in the clinical data that were reported by the owner and/or the veterinarian. Moreover, other co-infecting microorganisms (bacteria, parasites, viruses) could have contributed to the diarrhea in the clinical cases that were submitted (18). Unfortunately, the intestinal microbiota of diarrheic animals was not part of this study and, therefore, it was not investigated. In conclusion, by far the most prevalent CPV variant found in the feces of Canadian diarrheic dogs is CPV-2b.",57,1,29,31,Virology; Vaccination; Canine minute virus; Parvovirus; Canine parvovirus; Multiplex; Population; Genotyping; Attenuated vaccine; Biology,,"Animals; Antigens, Viral/genetics; Canada/epidemiology; Diarrhea/epidemiology; Dog Diseases/epidemiology; Dogs; Feces/virology; Genetic Variation; Parvoviridae Infections/epidemiology; Parvovirus, Canine/classification; Prevalence","Antigens, Viral",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26740694/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26740694 http://pubmed.cn/26740694 https://papyrus.bib.umontreal.ca/xmlui/handle/1866/13336,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26740694,,2235992939,PMC4677605,0,001-217-210-563-834; 009-734-411-529-823; 019-706-760-123-21X; 023-552-287-887-534; 026-340-721-721-241; 029-073-917-656-491; 032-199-490-345-644; 038-210-035-746-350; 039-726-729-500-754; 040-132-903-932-85X; 042-657-858-042-675; 056-964-970-281-156; 076-388-191-663-65X; 081-431-872-613-270; 089-130-286-326-22X; 098-388-474-335-136; 128-247-345-842-788; 166-783-238-763-272,22,"research support, non-u.s. gov't",(pmid) 26740694; (magid) 2235992939; (pmcid) pmc4677605,zh_chs; en

Our taxonomy includes 11 quality assessment methods that were identified by means of a systematic literature review. These methods are described in detail, including their main characteristics and limitations. This taxonomy not only provides a systematic and comprehensive account of the existing set of methods for CGI quality assessment, but also enables researchers working on the quality of CGI in various sources (e.g., social media, crowd sensing, collaborative mapping) to learn from each other, thus opening up avenues for future work that combines and extends existing methods into new application areas and domains.",22,2,542,560,Systematic review; Data science; Application areas; No reference; Quality assessment; Computer science; Information quality; Collaborative mapping; Social media,,,,Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico; Universität Heidelberg; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; Marie Curie Actions/Initial Training Networks; Federal University of Bahia,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/tgis.12329 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/tgis/tgis22.html#DegrossiARZ18 https://core.ac.uk/display/151393683 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5993263 http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/99434/ https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/tgis.12329 https://doi.org/10.1111/tgis.12329,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tgis.12329,10.1111/tgis.12329,2801965260,PMC5993263,0,002-555-907-164-663; 006-548-035-543-374; 006-819-919-095-61X; 009-680-290-520-847; 011-854-399-312-637; 012-718-310-557-41X; 013-516-235-069-82X; 014-845-068-774-33X; 015-217-307-942-839; 015-682-464-559-538; 018-883-928-898-600; 020-132-620-861-048; 023-351-967-000-166; 026-645-756-189-301; 027-266-736-807-56X; 027-736-997-184-595; 028-338-041-114-464; 029-263-057-554-467; 030-416-570-557-01X; 030-975-962-975-895; 035-693-777-939-75X; 036-799-697-900-267; 037-544-768-163-80X; 040-267-517-107-219; 041-658-614-339-032; 048-400-414-195-536; 049-508-058-894-875; 053-620-292-475-147; 056-689-719-832-399; 057-545-918-303-995; 068-161-627-517-578; 068-746-185-815-183; 072-346-674-622-560; 088-339-711-439-200; 097-612-174-011-049; 097-773-332-306-457; 111-901-923-536-480; 124-240-630-780-785; 127-491-841-235-58X; 128-630-302-259-009; 142-288-199-262-002; 142-867-773-436-799; 147-640-789-885-64X; 158-400-294-926-346; 171-544-875-588-246,11,,(pmcid) pmc5993263; (magid) 2801965260; (pii) tgis12329; (pmid) 29937686; (doi) 10.1111/tgis.12329,en

084-046-107-385-731,Military Personnel Who Seek Health and Mental Health Services Outside the Military,2018-02-05,2018,journal article,Military medicine,1930613x; 00264075,Association of Military Surgeons of the US,United States,Howard Waitzkin; Mario Cruz; Bryant Shuey; Daniel Smithers; Laura Muncy; Marylou Noble,"Background Although research conducted within the military has assessed the health and mental health problems of military personnel, little information exists about personnel who seek care outside the military. The purpose of this study is to clarify the personal characteristics, mental health diagnoses, and experiences of active duty U.S. military personnel who sought civilian sector services due to unmet needs for care. Materials and methods This prospective, multi-method study included 233 clients, based in the United States, Afghanistan, South Korea, and Germany, who obtained care between 2013 and 2016 from a nationwide network of volunteer civilian practitioners. A hotline organized by faith-based and peace organizations received calls from clients and referred them to the network when the clients described unmet needs for physical or mental health services. Intake and follow-up interviews at 2 wk and 2 mo after intake captured demographic characteristics, mental health diagnoses, and reasons for seeking civilian rather than military care. Non-parametric bootstrap regression analyses identified predictors of psychiatric disorders, suicidality, and absence without leave (AWOL). Qualitative analyses of clients' narratives clarified their experiences and reasons for seeking care. The research protocol has been reviewed and approved annually by the Institutional Review Board at the University of New Mexico. Results Depression (72%), post-traumatic stress disorder (62%), alcohol use disorder (27%), and panic disorder (25%) were the most common diagnoses. Forty-eight percent of clients reported suicidal ideation. Twenty percent were absence without leave. Combat trauma predicted post-traumatic stress disorder (odds ratio [OR] = 8.84, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.66, 47.12, p = 0.01) and absence without leave (OR = x3.85, 95% CI 1.14, 12.94, p = 0.03). Non-combat trauma predicted panic disorder (OR = 3.64, 95% CI 1.29, 10.23, p = 0.01). Geographical region was associated with generalized anxiety disorder (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.49, 0.99, p = 0.05). Significant predictors were not found for major depression, alcohol use disorder, or suicidal ideation. Clients' narrative themes included fear of reprisal for seeking services, mistrust of command, insufficient and unresponsive services, cost as a barrier to care, deception in recruitment, voluntary enlistment remorse, guilt about actual or potential killing of combatants or non-combatant civilians, preexisting mental health disorders, family and household challenges that contributed to distress, and military sexual trauma. Conclusions Our work clarified substantial unmet needs for services among active duty military personnel, the limitations of programs based in the military sector, and the potential value of civilian sector services that are not linked to military goals. We and our institutional review board opted against using a control group that would create ethical problems stemming from the denial of needed services. For future research, an evaluative strategy that can assess the impact of civilian services and that reconciles ethical concerns with study design remains a challenge. Due to inherent contradictions in the roles of military professionals, especially the double agency that makes professionals responsible to both clients and the military command, the policy alternative of providing services for military personnel in the civilian sector warrants serious consideration, as do preventive strategies such as non-military alternatives to conflict resolution.",183,5-6,e232,e240,Psychiatry; Mental health; Hotline; Psychology; Suicidal ideation; Active duty; Institutional review board; Military personnel; Alcohol use disorder; Denial,,"Adolescent; Adult; Alcoholism/epidemiology; Depression/epidemiology; Female; Health Services Accessibility/standards; Humans; Male; Mental Health Services/classification; Middle Aged; Military Personnel/psychology; Panic Disorder/epidemiology; Patient Acceptance of Health Care/statistics & numerical data; Prospective Studies; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/epidemiology; United States/epidemiology; Warfare/psychology",,Robert Wood Johnson Center for Health Policy,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29415229/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29415229 https://academic.oup.com/milmed/article/183/5-6/e232/4838357,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/milmed/usx051,10.1093/milmed/usx051,2793874425,,0,005-223-811-415-921; 009-615-448-329-145; 010-636-551-633-485; 011-850-621-151-371; 012-301-345-002-39X; 014-262-483-505-001; 019-088-668-934-989; 022-536-322-605-613; 026-024-601-113-116; 028-710-198-092-599; 033-572-000-492-190; 033-770-961-352-004; 033-795-012-457-788; 036-675-984-003-716; 041-233-667-017-076; 041-473-049-219-28X; 050-562-989-839-690; 050-752-403-803-795; 052-182-651-854-875; 059-876-613-437-422; 063-031-285-631-217; 064-624-976-467-217; 067-623-482-804-011; 068-893-287-922-932; 069-850-977-744-404; 075-446-577-699-117; 076-855-418-097-382; 085-583-543-604-670; 090-304-151-186-314; 104-878-369-472-515; 107-613-538-299-334; 110-937-683-836-932; 119-473-403-957-751; 132-242-831-755-892; 133-410-231-487-288; 136-109-110-754-809; 149-872-509-251-120; 158-926-736-232-728; 165-002-522-602-15X; 175-588-582-569-121,12,"research support, non-u.s. gov't",(pmid) 29415229; (magid) 2793874425; (pii) 4838357; (doi) 10.1093/milmed/usx051,en

Morales; Johannes Flacke; Javier Morales; Jaap Zevenbergen,"Data scarcity is still a common barrier to adequately understanding urban access in Global South countries. Widely used location-based methods address the traditional definition of accessibility as the easiness to reach land-uses by means of available mobility modes. Space Syntax instead analyses accessibility as network centrality focusing only on the topological and geometric properties of urban layouts, making it comparatively less data-intense. However, the interpretation of its outputs is limited to its own theory. Knowledge is missing on how such metrics are comparable to the metrics produced by location-based methods. The objective of the research was to compare both approaches for mapping urban accessibility in two cities in Guatemala. Our hypothesis tested the assumption that Space Syntax metrics could consistently reflect accessibility conditions that so far have only been measured by location-based methods. We proposed an approach using volunteered geo-information and produced accessibility maps following both approaches that were then compared using Pearson correlations. Space Syntax metrics at low and high radii are consistently correlated with location-based access to land uses that reflect location quality at neighbourhood and city-wide scale correspondingly. Space Syntax metrics at lower radii reflect time-based access restrictions either posed in the location-based analyses or by reduced accessibility by public transport. The hypothesis acceptance, p < 0.01, expands the scope of accessibility knowledge derivable from limited data availability using Space Syntax, which is relevant for its applicability in data-scarce contexts by planners and researchers in the Global South. Rather than replacing location-based methods Space Syntax offers an important complementary measure to geographical accessibility. This having been said, Space Syntax could contribute to early-stage planning by gaining overall insights into patterns of urban access.",12,2,205,228,Scarcity; Data mining; Neighbourhood (mathematics); Geography; Data science; Global South; Space syntax; Land use; Centrality; Public transport; Human geography,,,,NUFFIC,https://research.utwente.nl/en/publications/mapping-urban-accessibility-in-data-scarce-contexts-using-space-s-2 https://paperity.org/p/84914724/mapping-urban-accessibility-in-data-scarce-contexts-using-space-syntax-and-location-based https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Aris.utwente.nl%3Apublications%2F739f6af2-be86-41a0-9260-f897521f81e7 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs12061-017-9239-1.pdf https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12061-017-9239-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12061-017-9239-1,10.1007/s12061-017-9239-1,2761280990,,0,002-034-257-565-655; 005-068-080-005-314; 008-902-196-782-511; 009-123-335-816-050; 009-960-960-328-843; 012-959-395-208-901; 013-438-045-369-177; 014-678-575-020-828; 014-989-686-472-905; 015-668-190-196-707; 023-317-295-598-61X; 023-631-244-297-601; 025-022-545-289-292; 025-108-233-895-514; 025-669-726-155-59X; 026-139-226-478-040; 031-242-251-920-407; 033-304-187-419-717; 046-123-731-855-969; 046-293-694-398-27X; 046-648-912-291-578; 050-969-924-019-047; 051-205-532-750-865; 052-220-933-962-457; 057-315-859-853-44X; 059-946-512-439-497; 061-392-051-844-253; 064-860-416-567-126; 068-992-409-599-322; 071-881-202-792-084; 075-489-909-616-083; 077-359-509-902-504; 077-646-788-395-710; 081-828-710-631-05X; 083-371-324-802-442; 090-886-968-171-881; 094-370-792-240-510; 099-530-671-829-89X; 100-265-721-317-075; 101-185-493-589-39X; 101-392-458-093-50X; 103-029-777-239-250; 106-945-295-200-575; 116-338-361-316-049; 117-068-926-892-22X; 118-657-001-355-635; 119-735-713-316-500; 120-326-121-604-072; 123-090-310-845-220; 124-214-667-456-904; 126-184-248-265-490; 133-102-847-538-413; 134-764-881-071-190; 137-393-275-483-24X; 141-691-329-108-550; 160-279-043-500-228; 166-306-343-832-020; 175-126-984-005-920; 177-998-975-976-224,2,,(doi) 10.1007/s12061-017-9239-1; (magid) 2761280990; (coreid) 98209230,en

084-397-468-164-699,Towards a Protocol for the Collection of VGI Vector Data,2016-11-17,2016,journal article,ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information,22209964,MDPI AG,Switzerland,Peter Mooney; Marco Minghini; Mari Laakso; Vyron Antoniou; Ana-Maria Olteanu-Raimond; Andriani Skopeliti,"A protocol for the collection of vector data in Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) projects is proposed. VGI is a source of crowdsourced geographic data and information which is comparable, and in some cases better, than equivalent data from National Mapping Agencies (NMAs) and Commercial Surveying Companies (CSC). However, there are many differences in how NMAs and CSC collect, analyse, manage and distribute geographic information to that of VGI projects. NMAs and CSC make use of robust and standardised data collection protocols whilst VGI projects often provide guidelines rather than rigorous data collection specifications. The proposed protocol addresses formalising the collection and creation of vector data in VGI projects in three principal ways: by manual vectorisation; field survey; and reuse of existing data sources.

Para evaluar la distribución espacial del potencial de turismo rural (RTP), un enfoque metodológico fue seguido combinando el empleo sinérgico de los sistemas de información geográfica (SIG) y el proceso analítico jerárquico (AHP). Para el modelo de evaluación, seis factores fueron examinados y jerarquizado por un panel de 18 expertos: oferta de alojamiento, actividades turísticas en áreas naturales, oferta gastronómica, actividades culturales, ofrecen baño en ambientes naturales, y actividades de turismo activo. Estos factores fueron luego descompuestos en treinta y dos criterios de evaluación y la importancia relativa de sus pesos fue estimada utilizando sentencias por pares. Utilizando datos disponibles públicamente y se ofreció información geográfica (VGI) plataformas, los datos espaciales y no espaciales fueron recolectados, clasificadas, y estandarizados, empleo apropiado de herramientas desarrolladas con un software GIS de recursos abiertos.

These factors were then decomposed into thirty-two evaluation criteria and the relative importance of their weights was estimated using pairwise judgments. Using publicly available data and volunteered geographic information (VGI) platforms, the related spatial and non-spatial data were collected, collated, and standardized, employing appropriate tools developed with open-source GIS software.

While OSM data is widely used, considerably little attention has been paid to the quality of its Point-of-interest (POI) component. This work studies the accuracy, coverage, and trend worthiness of POI data. We assess the accuracy and coverage using another VGI source that utilizes editorial control. OSM data is compared to Foursquare data by using a combination of label similarity and positional proximity. Using the example of coffee shop POIs in Manhattan we also assess the trend worthiness of OSM data. A series of spatio-temporal statistical models are tested to compare change in the number of coffee shops to home prices in certain areas. This work overall shows that, although not perfect, OSM POI data and specifically its temporal aspect (changeset) can be used to drive urban science research and to study urban change.",14,2,e0212606,,Statistical model; Point of interest; Spatial analysis; Data science; Computer science; Geographic information system; Land use; Urban geography; Volunteered geographic information; Data curation,,Data Curation; Geographic Information Systems; Humans; Urban Renewal,,National Science Foundation; U.S. Department of Defense; George Mason University,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0212606 https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0212606&type=printable https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30802251/ https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019PLoSO..1412606Z/abstract https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30802251,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0212606,10.1371/journal.pone.0212606,2916706735,PMC6388917,0,000-841-397-940-136; 001-973-621-872-600; 002-786-522-829-407; 004-260-021-229-709; 007-512-146-614-819; 008-001-341-653-057; 012-082-370-572-995; 012-493-943-783-690; 016-658-519-496-156; 016-876-572-791-301; 018-468-049-467-670; 021-424-590-950-330; 024-419-373-622-472; 024-559-871-295-739; 025-116-684-954-608; 029-147-461-746-542; 029-965-425-507-24X; 032-342-914-657-801; 035-577-047-601-038; 038-976-596-179-447; 040-295-997-767-109; 044-862-466-382-887; 046-710-718-173-361; 048-561-645-219-811; 051-559-431-834-54X; 054-704-332-014-121; 057-012-745-462-629; 057-545-918-303-995; 061-176-889-022-783; 062-526-098-021-024; 063-820-040-910-914; 067-793-529-827-539; 074-272-058-786-709; 076-487-286-224-012; 083-815-629-123-031; 084-304-879-650-709; 086-676-991-755-308; 088-005-327-463-513; 088-339-711-439-200; 090-714-883-229-684; 095-812-341-117-021; 096-841-338-242-402; 103-777-506-943-151; 105-699-542-961-965; 109-679-635-444-93X; 117-151-206-786-186; 118-657-001-355-635; 128-924-197-500-166; 132-348-001-538-712; 138-847-225-776-212; 140-626-904-354-997; 141-353-756-555-871; 142-261-123-140-527; 168-663-423-050-326; 189-368-093-334-341; 189-883-705-443-482; 190-032-990-340-879,6,"comparative study; research support, non-u.s. gov't; research support, u.s. gov't, non-p.h.s.",(magid) 2916706735; (doi) 10.1371/journal.pone.0212606; (pmcid) pmc6388917; (pmid) 30802251; (pii) pone-d-17-37885,en
086-129-231-749-826,Developing a Plant Clinic Database as an Educational and Predictive Tool for Master Gardener Programs,,2001,journal article,HortTechnology,10630198; 19437714,American Society for Horticultural Science,United States,Larry Joh; David V. Barkley,"The North Carolina Cooperative Extension Service’s New Hanover County Center provides the Plant Disease and Insect Clinic staffed by the Horticulture Extension Agent and Master Gardener volunteers. Residents bring in samples of weeds, diseases, and insects for identification and control recommendations. After the problem is diagnosed, a record of the information is used to construct a database that includes the date, phone number, crop, diagnosis, and control for each sample submitted. Between January 1993 and December 1999, Master Gardener volunteers entered more than 4,000 entries into a searchable/sortable electronic database to identify patterns of plant disorders. The database should be a useful tool for predicting local disease and insect cycles and aiding Master Gardeners in answering questions at the clinic and over the telephone. In addition, examination of historical records and entry of data into the database are excellent learning opportunities for new Master Gardeners. C ooperative extension agents and Master Gardener volunteers provide helpful advice to county residents on a variety of topics. Many cooperative extension offices have trained staff available to answer questions over the telephone or to examine specimens submitted to a plant clinic. An extension agent is aware of crops that have persistent problems in his or her area, the problems that are being identified, and current recommendations for these problems. To effectively evaluate trends, an extension agent needs historical and current information on the crops, diagnoses, controls, and locations of disease, insect, and weed problems. This knowledge allows the extension agent to focus on recurring issues, minimize pesticide resistance (by rotating pesticide recommendations), tailor educational programs, and be proactive rather than reactive. The information also provides educational benefit for novice as well as experienced Master Gardeners. Master Gardeners are required to complete a training program and a specified number of volunteer hours. Simonson and Pals (1990) found that the most common reason individuals become Master Gardeners is a desire to increase their gardening knowledge for their own use, while Schrock et al. (2000) found that they want to learn more about horticulture and home gardening. The training program combines a training manual and hands-on exercises with an overview of horticultural subjects pertinent to the students’ geographic area. While this training forms a firm foundation, successful Master Gardeners further their horticultural skills by finding answers to clients’ questions and performing other volunteer work. Service learning, obtained from active participation in addressing community needs, is an effective form of Extension education (Simpson, 1998). Answering questions on a hotline or at a plant clinic is a difficult task for a new, inexperienced Master Gardener. Some cooperative extension offices have customized resource manuals that provide answers to common questions received by telephone (Patterson, 1995). Master Gardeners can accelerate their learning and build confidence through mentoring by an extension agent or a more experienced Master Gardener (Rogers, 1997; Phillips and Bradshaw, 1999). Another way to build skills is to review documentation of how past plant problems were handled. However, it is rarely possible to examine past horticultural records and gain this knowledge with ease. While a client is waiting on the telephone or in person, wading through a mountain of records to find an appropriate answer to the question is not feasible. A computer database can help Master Gardeners learn and disseminate information more accurately and quickly and serve an extension agent’s need to analyze trends in horticultural problems. The objectives of the database project were 3-fold: 1) develop a suitable database platform for the North Carolina Cooperative Extension Service’s New Hanover County Center Plant Disease and Insect Clinic records that could be sorted by different criteria and analyzed for trends; 2) use data entry as a learning activity for new Master Gardeners; and 3) use information from the database to improve the Master Gardener training course and better prepare volunteers to answer clinic questions. In addition, the database can be searched on-line to answer questions and help predict insect and disease problems.

086-203-673-633-604,Where does bicycling for health happen? Analysing volunteered geographic information through place and plexus,,2015,journal article,Journal of Transport & Health,22141405,Elsevier BV,Netherlands,Greg P. Griffin; Junfeng Jiao,"Research on the role of bicycling for health through physical activity has been limited by the lack of information on where bicyclists ride. New big data sources available through smartphone-based applications provide a rich source to provide bicycle volume data more comparable to the scale of information available for automotive and public transit modes. In the case of smartphone apps for fitness tracking, results of this data can be used similar to the growing application of global positioning systems for automotive travel surveying. The authors evaluate data from Travis County, Texas for the purpose of determining where bicyclists ride, primarily for fitness purposes. Ride trip volumes are evaluated with residential and employment density, land use diversity, bicycle facilities and terrain to characterize places chosen for bicycling for health. Though limited to bicycle rides and routes voluntarily logged using the smartphone app, this method provides promise for applications in multi-modal transportation planning and health impact assessment studies.",2,2,238,247,Engineering; Built environment; Transport engineering; Health impact assessment; Poison control; Transportation planning; Geographic information system; Public transport; Volunteered geographic information; Big data,,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214140514001042 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214140514001042 https://trid.trb.org/view/1356872,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jth.2014.12.001,10.1016/j.jth.2014.12.001,1984504891,,0,000-156-762-475-258; 002-660-246-620-231; 005-548-993-564-383; 008-655-662-451-459; 016-649-493-218-937; 016-894-036-061-216; 024-429-974-564-991; 024-682-850-628-497; 031-604-306-006-870; 035-117-323-278-12X; 036-756-289-435-044; 037-789-728-709-770; 038-168-344-060-751; 041-616-351-931-10X; 045-187-707-648-683; 045-293-807-077-186; 046-509-496-371-690; 046-875-571-101-886; 046-909-835-647-720; 047-229-121-484-621; 047-709-327-277-196; 053-126-240-822-22X; 055-991-696-008-698; 062-155-735-553-745; 063-000-569-746-786; 064-128-871-665-724; 071-955-980-064-277; 072-489-726-506-624; 078-142-284-891-523; 082-240-741-404-30X; 083-582-080-112-09X; 083-995-895-152-24X; 086-425-178-936-791; 087-654-931-657-641; 089-973-038-582-537; 091-793-997-710-569; 094-005-573-903-665; 105-270-017-956-795; 105-742-469-348-136; 106-608-398-109-697; 110-886-806-180-340; 113-286-529-951-564; 117-813-640-396-404; 117-971-355-916-646; 118-959-279-989-548; 126-351-306-430-905; 129-395-493-515-165; 134-716-630-828-164; 137-512-996-894-339; 138-440-382-883-623; 143-314-474-249-084; 144-079-526-896-582; 147-295-873-242-183; 156-393-581-777-405; 165-434-124-474-26X; 166-713-434-652-584; 166-859-397-476-885; 169-344-206-015-549; 176-023-456-441-563; 181-881-919-793-533; 192-695-028-871-702,67,,(doi) 10.1016/j.jth.2014.12.001; (magid) 1984504891,en

OpenStreetMap (OSM), the leading VGI project, aims at building an open-content world map through user contributions. OSM semantics consists of a set of properties (called 'tags') describing geographic classes, whose usage is defined by project contributors on a dedicated Wiki website. Because of its simple and open semantic structure, the OSM approach often results in noisy and ambiguous data, limiting its usability for analysis in information retrieval, recommender systems and data mining. Devising a mechanism for computing the semantic similarity of the OSM geographic classes can help alleviate this semantic gap. The contribution of this paper is twofold. It consists of (1) the development of the OSM Semantic Network by means of a web crawler tailored to the OSM Wiki website; this semantic network can be used to compute semantic similarity through co-citation measures, providing a novel semantic tool for OSM and GIS communities; (2) a study of the cognitive plausibility (i.e. the ability to replicate human judgement) of co-citation algorithms when applied to the computation of semantic similarity of geographic concepts. Empirical evidence supports the usage of co-citation algorithms-SimRank showing the highest plausibility-to compute concept similarity in a crowdsourced semantic network",37,1,61,81,Semantics; Semantic similarity; Semantic Web Stack; Information retrieval; Co-citation; Computer science; Semantic computing; Volunteered geographic information; Semantic network; Semantic gap,,,,,https://researchrepository.ucd.ie/handle/10197/3973 https://researchrepository.ucd.ie/bitstream/10197/3973/1/2012_-_Geographic_Knowledge_Extraction_and_Semantic_Similarity_in_OpenStreetMap_-_Ballatore_et_al.pdf https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10115-012-0571-0 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/kais/kais37.html#BallatoreBW13 http://core.ac.uk/display/16341161 https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s10115-012-0571-0 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10115-012-0571-0 https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10115-012-0571-0 http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10115-012-0571-0 https://doi.org/10.1007/s10115-012-0571-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10115-012-0571-0,10.1007/s10115-012-0571-0,2034893208,,0,000-074-136-931-405; 000-894-184-902-194; 003-543-027-674-540; 004-919-373-880-071; 008-033-055-544-243; 009-225-216-915-07X; 010-199-561-165-862; 014-445-211-580-325; 014-818-480-999-908; 017-194-800-561-718; 021-737-599-740-214; 023-927-221-065-800; 025-772-076-142-046; 026-046-734-626-131; 026-179-378-131-448; 027-574-589-658-991; 029-965-425-507-24X; 036-999-230-405-701; 038-976-596-179-447; 040-512-642-397-573; 042-016-741-529-244; 046-243-812-882-439; 046-816-619-048-982; 048-587-117-313-594; 051-978-330-522-842; 054-818-565-070-154; 057-545-918-303-995; 063-348-170-796-658; 066-101-498-522-68X; 066-336-138-162-728; 066-711-748-643-90X; 075-516-361-159-497; 077-752-345-760-175; 079-206-649-149-003; 080-112-249-084-675; 082-639-032-368-654; 083-390-104-481-847; 084-842-537-975-587; 093-188-464-952-925; 096-630-503-965-816; 096-724-748-755-312; 100-335-377-481-888; 101-443-953-847-580; 105-157-602-100-168; 105-213-938-893-054; 106-264-944-278-433; 115-156-765-087-939; 116-716-952-521-912; 120-695-214-222-114; 120-784-912-296-107; 136-901-641-759-851; 138-730-709-247-617; 140-585-530-435-793; 144-548-847-592-554; 144-862-990-083-379; 147-876-713-700-216; 152-049-230-384-476; 152-161-156-824-815; 155-271-647-356-434; 159-422-950-997-446; 160-597-801-195-861; 170-152-726-149-857; 175-772-781-692-501; 188-144-860-850-795,97,,(coreid) 16341161; (doi) 10.1007/s10115-012-0571-0; (magid) 2034893208,en

Normally, untrained contributors gather these data. This fact is frequently a cause of concern regarding the quality and usability of such data. In this study, the quality of OSM land use and land cover (LULC) data is investigated for an area in southern Germany. Two spatial data quality elements, thematic accuracy and completeness are addressed by comparing the OSM data with an authoritative German reference dataset. The results show that the kappa value indicates a substantial agreement between the OSM and the authoritative dataset. Nonetheless, for our study region, there are clear variations between the LULC classes. Forest covers a large area and shows both a high OSM completeness (97.6%) and correctness (95.1%). In contrast, farmland also covers a large area, but for this class OSM shows a low completeness value (45.9%) due to unmapped areas. Additionally, the results indicate that a high population density, as present in urbanized areas, seems to denote a higher strength of agreement between OSM and the DLM (Digital Landscape Model). However, a low population density does not necessarily imply a low strength of agreement.",4,3,1657,1671,Usability; Geography; Data quality; Land cover; Spatial data quality; Reference dataset; Land use; Volunteered geographic information; Cartography; Thematic map,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/90135207 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ijgi/ijgi4.html#DornTZ15 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015IJGI....4.1657D/abstract https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi4031657 https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/4/3/1657/pdf https://doaj.org/article/8345e89336a048e7992a27b3fbf84798 https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/4/3/1657 https://doi.org/10.3390%2Fijgi4031657,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi4031657,10.3390/ijgi4031657,1776314870,,0,009-961-810-367-892; 011-097-981-743-648; 014-818-480-999-908; 022-473-450-579-960; 022-816-728-271-154; 025-116-684-954-608; 026-645-756-189-301; 029-963-409-674-751; 030-217-575-405-566; 030-416-570-557-01X; 030-975-962-975-895; 031-056-855-501-837; 038-976-596-179-447; 040-267-517-107-219; 045-201-107-411-584; 048-702-561-381-148; 057-545-918-303-995; 060-820-708-744-364; 063-392-296-214-893; 066-988-074-809-599; 077-776-126-525-825; 080-156-480-293-52X; 088-339-711-439-200; 091-143-618-066-204; 094-466-886-510-151; 112-077-422-191-684; 115-637-239-611-793; 117-560-473-540-807; 120-348-450-238-234; 124-043-027-110-303; 129-672-011-124-595; 133-439-587-267-381; 147-213-981-170-541; 171-544-875-588-246; 185-700-850-296-212; 190-216-777-739-959,65,,(doi) 10.3390/ijgi4031657; (coreid) 90135207; (magid) 1776314870,en

We connect places in networks through their thematic similarities by applying topic modeling to the textual volunteered geographic information (VGI) pertaining to the places. The network approach enhances previous research involving place clustering using geo-textual information, which often simplifies relationships between places to be either in-cluster or out-of-cluster. To demonstrate our approach, we use as a case study in Manhattan (New York) that compares networks constructed from three different geo-textural data sources—TripAdvisor attraction reviews, TripAdvisor restaurant reviews, and Twitter data. The results showcase how the thematic similarity network approach enables us to conduct clustering analysis as well as node-to-node and node-to-cluster analysis, which is fruitful for understanding how places are connected through individuals’ experiences. Furthermore, by enriching the networks with geodemographic information as node attributes, we discovered that some low-income communities in Manhattan have distinctive restaurant cultures. Even though geolocated tweets are not always related to place they are posted from, our case study demonstrates that topic modeling is an efficient method to filter out the place-irrelevant tweets and therefore refining how of places can be studied.</jats:p>",9,6,385,,Topic model; Data science; Geodemographic segmentation; Network approach; Thematic network; Computer science; Volunteered geographic information; Crowdsourcing; Cluster analysis; Thematic map,,,,,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi9060385 https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/9/6/385/htm https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020IJGI....9..385Y/abstract https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ijgi/ijgi9.html#YuanCZ20,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi9060385,10.3390/ijgi9060385,3035661062,,0,000-383-758-166-882; 000-585-793-890-214; 000-841-397-940-136; 002-236-676-431-817; 005-042-475-367-015; 005-298-866-994-170; 007-279-438-013-013; 008-538-168-589-011; 008-719-619-498-921; 010-631-537-217-984; 012-367-777-689-406; 015-692-170-714-052; 019-706-336-089-489; 020-731-280-375-880; 021-585-871-448-213; 023-351-967-000-166; 024-832-710-122-292; 025-138-712-861-431; 030-713-038-994-783; 044-805-473-856-154; 057-545-918-303-995; 067-414-994-416-820; 070-681-055-882-799; 072-313-669-024-397; 074-635-780-925-366; 075-233-709-903-409; 076-968-702-944-72X; 077-302-191-078-385; 081-017-175-793-348; 083-509-307-560-823; 083-910-341-024-793; 088-173-565-608-856; 104-833-265-022-668; 115-960-976-573-256; 118-410-291-775-667; 121-680-550-702-883; 122-532-323-097-70X; 125-233-556-970-038; 126-244-896-522-135; 128-840-343-923-119; 137-474-975-275-497; 170-867-440-264-402; 177-884-562-116-378,2,,(magid) 3035661062; (doi) 10.3390/ijgi9060385,en

State government organisations are also interested in gaining access to this spatial data/information and engaging these groups to collect spatial information under their mapping programs. The aim of this paper is to explore the possible utilisation of volunteered geographic information (VGI) for catchment management activities. This research paper discusses the importance of spatial information and spatial data infrastructure (SDI) for catchment management and the emergence of VGI. A conceptual framework has been developed to illustrate how these emerging spatial information applications and various community volunteer activities can contribute to a more inclusive spatial data infrastructure (SDI) development at local level. A survey of 56 regional NRM bodies in Australia was utilised to explore the current community-driven volunteer initiatives for NRM activities and the potential of utilisation of VGI initiatives for NRM decision making process. This research paper concludes that VGI activities have great potential to contribute to SDI development at the community level to achieve better natural resource management (NRM) outcomes.",I-4,,275,280,User-generated content; Decision-making; Conceptual framework; Spatial analysis; Natural resource management; Spatial data infrastructure; Geography; Natural resource; Knowledge management; Volunteered geographic information; Environmental planning,,,,,https://noa.gwlb.de/receive/cop_mods_00025424 https://www.isprs-ann-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/I-4/275/2012/isprsannals-I-4-275-2012.pdf http://www.isprs-ann-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/I-4/275/2012/isprsannals-I-4-275-2012.html http://eprints.usq.edu.au/21633/ http://eprints.usq.edu.au/21633/2/Paudyal_McDougall_Apan_ISPRS_2012_PV.pdf http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ISPAn..I4..275P/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/isprsannals-i-4-275-2012,10.5194/isprsannals-i-4-275-2012,2097066001,,0,010-216-496-464-998; 019-183-419-987-591; 021-725-130-167-598; 032-903-495-847-439; 046-000-407-319-312; 049-641-424-372-181; 062-413-372-752-508; 135-360-535-210-851; 146-706-759-901-808; 151-014-973-442-562; 163-098-634-563-761; 166-717-292-919-682; 169-004-007-623-620; 185-681-956-068-356,6,,(doi) 10.5194/isprsannals-i-4-275-2012; (magid) 2097066001; (coreid) 92147267,en
088-452-227-475-191,Using volunteered geographic information (VGI) in design-based statistical inference for area estimation and accuracy assessment of land cover,,2018,journal article,Remote Sensing of Environment,00344257,Elsevier BV,Netherlands,Stephen V. Stehman; Cidália Costa Fonte; Giles M. Foody; Linda See,"Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) offers a potentially inexpensive source of reference data for estimating area and assessing map accuracy in the context of remote-sensing based land-cover monitoring. The quality of observations from VGI and the typical lack of an underlying probability sampling design raise concerns regarding use of VGI in widely-applied design-based statistical inference. This article focuses on the fundamental issue of sampling design used to acquire VGI. Design-based inference requires the sample data to be obtained via a probability sampling design. Options for incorporating VGI within design-based inference include: 1) directing volunteers to obtain data for locations selected by a probability sampling design; 2) treating VGI data as a “certainty stratum” and augmenting the VGI with data obtained from a probability sample; and 3) using VGI to create an auxiliary variable that is then used in a model-assisted estimator to reduce the standard error of an estimate produced from a probability sample. The latter two options can be implemented using VGI data that were obtained from a non-probability sampling design, but require additional sample data to be acquired via a probability sampling design. If the only data available are VGI obtained from a non-probability sample, properties of design-based inference that are ensured by probability sampling must be replaced by assumptions that may be difficult to verify. For example, pseudo-estimation weights can be constructed that mimic weights used in stratified sampling estimators. However, accuracy and area estimates produced using these pseudo-weights still require the VGI data to be representative of the full population, a property known as “external validity”. Because design-based inference requires a probability sampling design, directing volunteers to locations specified by a probability sampling design is the most straightforward option for use of VGI in design-based inference. Combining VGI from a non-probability sample with data from a probability sample using the certainty stratum approach or the model-assisted approach are viable alternatives that meet the conditions required for design-based inference and use the VGI data to advantage to reduce standard errors.",212,,47,59,Data mining; Statistical inference; Estimator; Inference; Population; Computer science; Stratified sampling; Volunteered geographic information; Remote sensing; Sampling design; Sampling (statistics),,,,Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia; Seventh Framework Programme; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme; U.S. Geological Survey; National Aeronautics and Space Administration; Cooperative Agreement,http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018RSEnv.212...47S/abstract http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/15247/ https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425718301627 https://nottingham-repository.worktribe.com/output/944248 http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/51447/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2018.04.014,10.1016/j.rse.2018.04.014,2802971269,,0,002-555-907-164-663; 003-677-713-873-99X; 003-996-677-468-345; 006-195-688-668-296; 007-857-101-229-718; 010-390-048-140-045; 011-433-390-881-272; 014-348-277-735-954; 015-447-260-345-503; 017-465-705-893-310; 018-012-890-997-107; 018-663-572-986-479; 018-923-819-294-430; 020-132-620-861-048; 022-816-161-720-51X; 027-975-023-646-85X; 030-357-819-693-272; 030-715-576-997-331; 031-450-942-446-667; 036-280-395-934-735; 036-670-900-801-09X; 038-737-833-432-656; 038-976-596-179-447; 043-895-959-690-583; 044-258-658-720-640; 046-125-346-020-083; 048-400-414-195-536; 049-847-403-314-760; 050-539-693-523-843; 053-373-948-587-219; 053-620-292-475-147; 057-545-918-303-995; 060-188-831-346-453; 063-933-394-416-906; 066-166-840-895-025; 066-325-608-398-054; 069-048-542-531-065; 069-185-404-597-315; 070-972-560-010-625; 079-468-141-942-502; 079-717-932-887-081; 088-339-711-439-200; 089-072-935-908-359; 089-849-544-350-896; 091-677-080-425-40X; 099-523-636-461-537; 100-061-368-250-820; 101-618-280-720-690; 105-986-180-695-824; 106-336-903-153-79X; 125-134-724-831-050; 126-135-573-200-753; 127-055-131-693-518; 128-448-195-196-442; 128-630-302-259-009; 132-062-267-676-65X; 138-847-225-776-212; 140-904-225-952-642; 141-404-322-947-920; 144-096-391-736-702; 150-597-705-102-79X; 155-352-276-423-259; 157-114-055-045-628; 158-847-532-778-731; 163-008-278-549-071; 171-243-981-870-721; 172-081-485-715-076; 189-174-727-974-565,17,,(doi) 10.1016/j.rse.2018.04.014; (magid) 2802971269,en

This article presents an effort to validate and further improve a previously published innovative approach for drawing macroseismic intensity maps from data extracted from sources of volunteered geographic information (VGI). Our approach involves classification of macroseismic observations (extracted from social media sources) to values of the EMS 98 intensity scale, leading to the drawing of isoseismal maps. The earthquake of June 12th, 2017 (Mw 6.3) that occurred off the south coast of Lesvos Island, Greece, was used as a case study; its main shock was located at depth of about 13 km. This specific event, which claimed the life of a woman and caused at least 15 injuries due to collapsing buildings and falling debris (mainly in the town of Vrissa), was chosen for the specific geomorphological characteristics of the meizoseismal area, time of occurrence and distribution of damage. Twitter was chosen as a VGI source mostly for reasons of consistency with the original published work, generating comparable findings that can be assessed more readily to facilitate further development of the methodology. Results of the dataset analysis include the drawing of the isoseismal maps from Tweets published within different time periods (6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h); and the identification of various text patterns regarding the evaluation of the macroseismic observations that result into intensity values. The present work offers additional empirical evidence regarding the validity of the methodology presented in the scientific literature, and further enriches it by providing additional text patterns and specific improvements related to the classification of the information in certain values of seismic intensity. Assessment of the results is enriched by the progress that has been noted in the field and has been presented in the international scientific literature since 2016.",XLII-3/W4,,59,66,Empirical evidence; Geography; Scientific literature; Social media; Volunteered geographic information; Cartography,,,,,https://noa.gwlb.de/receive/cop_mods_00007083 https://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/XLII-3-W4/59/2018/ https://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/XLII-3-W4/59/2018/isprs-archives-XLII-3-W4-59-2018.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-xlii-3-w4-59-2018,10.5194/isprs-archives-xlii-3-w4-59-2018,2809140873,,0,,4,,(magid) 2809140873; (doi) 10.5194/isprs-archives-xlii-3-w4-59-2018,en

VGI data is often provided only as vector data represented by lines and not as full extent. Also, high geolocation accuracy is not guaranteed and it is common to observe misalignment with the target road segments by several pixels on the images. In this work, we use the prior information provided by the VGI and extract the full road extent even if there is significant mis-registration between the VGI and the image. The method consists of image segmentation and traversal of multiple agents along available VGI information. First, we perform image segmentation, and then we traverse through the fragmented road segments using autonomous agents to obtain a complete road map in a semi-automatic way once the seed-points are defined. The road center-line in the VGI guides the process and allows us to discover and extract the full extent of the road network based on the image data. The results demonstrate the validity and good performance of the proposed method for road extraction that reflects the actual road width despite the presence of disturbances such as shadows, cars and trees which shows the efficiency of the fusion of the VGI and satellite images.</jats:p>",ahead-of-print,ahead-of-print,,,Image segmentation; Tree traversal; Artificial intelligence; Pixel; Traverse; Road map; Geolocation; Computer vision; Computer science; Volunteered geographic information; Segmentation,,,,,https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1016/j.aci.2018.07.004/full/html https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2210832718301492,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aci.2018.07.004,10.1016/j.aci.2018.07.004,2884732374,,0,000-165-291-532-416; 001-839-186-565-384; 002-504-164-165-357; 004-445-599-749-605; 006-132-011-457-317; 011-064-739-772-837; 011-303-881-009-686; 013-185-779-386-66X; 015-582-718-510-067; 016-196-543-516-475; 021-951-169-371-276; 024-295-417-467-792; 026-074-684-507-14X; 027-345-662-611-374; 027-736-997-184-595; 027-887-833-618-850; 028-150-332-095-609; 028-358-249-749-803; 034-605-500-700-579; 036-704-493-358-475; 038-414-625-422-377; 040-267-517-107-219; 040-685-167-284-267; 043-597-144-511-585; 043-808-677-096-596; 045-772-175-555-095; 048-670-547-296-488; 049-938-757-793-344; 054-140-793-816-150; 054-172-404-584-226; 055-165-316-798-727; 057-423-920-506-550; 060-025-410-578-137; 061-413-211-972-28X; 061-710-579-708-592; 062-008-091-231-483; 063-390-053-777-270; 071-547-407-522-754; 072-104-186-976-093; 074-921-401-475-367; 078-996-416-652-233; 080-852-288-161-614; 084-691-349-271-288; 085-852-773-045-002; 088-645-585-619-408; 093-103-504-280-444; 096-933-885-351-294; 100-487-196-651-545; 100-590-526-851-570; 103-680-633-389-498; 109-202-426-853-587; 109-579-721-671-612; 119-069-119-232-783; 135-122-223-688-30X; 142-557-644-317-44X; 146-394-705-857-573; 147-848-363-668-51X; 152-307-038-183-411; 153-560-521-498-240; 163-191-345-579-376; 166-559-993-840-781; 171-544-875-588-246; 175-570-913-085-266; 180-085-927-404-522; 189-648-231-191-219; 190-183-348-218-102,6,,(doi) 10.1016/j.aci.2018.07.004; (magid) 2884732374,en

Ltd,India,Mahesh K Maskey; Kedar Baral; Rajani Shah; Bhagawan D Shrestha; Janet M. Lang; Kenneth J. Rothman,"The current estimate of global maternal deaths is 3429001. Almost all of these occur in developing countries. Among the six countries accounting for more than 50 per cent of all maternal deaths, two South Asian countries, India and Pakistan occupy 1st and 3rd position1. Over the past decade, reduction in maternal deaths has attained a high priority in global health movements. The fifth Millennium Development Goal (MDG5) of improving maternal health has set a target of reducing the maternal mortality ratio by 75 per cent between 1990 and 20152.; ; The most widely used measure of maternal mortality is the maternal mortality ratio, which is the ratio of the number of maternal deaths to the number of live births. It reflects (but is not identical to) the risk of maternal death once a woman has become pregnant. The 10th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) defined a maternal death as “the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management but not from accidental or incidental causes”3. Maternal deaths are divided into direct and indirect obstetrical deaths. In practice the distinction between an accidental and incidental death or a direct and indirect death is problematic, and a precise cause of death may not be known despite knowledge of pregnancy. ICD-10 has, therefore, introduced an alternative definition of maternal death, the pregnancy related death, which emphasizes timing of death rather than the cause to which the death is attributed3. Many maternal mortality surveys, such as the sisterhood method4 typically measure pregnancy-related deaths as maternal deaths, since the cause of death is not elicited in such surveys.; ; The methods for measuring maternal mortality can be grouped into two categories: empirical and analytical.· A vital registration system, a facility-based health services records, and a census can be regarded as routine opportunity empirical measurement while population based surveys like sisterhood method and demographic surveillance systems can be considered as special opportunity empirical measurements3. Main analytical approaches are Birth and Death Record Linkage, Capture-recapture methods for correcting under-reporting of maternal deaths, and statistical modeling used by UN systems3. There could be composite approaches also such as Reproductive Age Mortality Study (RAMOS) and the Motherhood Method.; ; In most developing countries, vital registration of medically-certified births and deaths is non-existent or incomplete, and validity or feasibility of other purely records-based approaches is questionable. A reproductive age mortality study (RAMOS) uses multiple sources such as records from hospital, police, public-health department and vital data registries to identify and investigate the cause of deaths for each woman of reproductive age in a defined population. Interviews with household members and health care providers provide a basis to classify the deaths as maternal or otherwise. The RAMOS approach is considered to be the most complete estimation of maternal mortality, but it can be complex, because information regarding the number of births must come from separate sources4. RAMOS is generally less expensive than population based surveys or a complete census. All these types of studies are subject to under-ascertainment problems, despite their intensive use of resources5,6.; ; The sisterhood method is either indirect or direct. In recent years, the direct sisterhood method has been used for calculating the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) over a time reference of 0-6 or 0-13 years ration7. This approach uses 11 questions and more respondents. Surveyed participants provide information about their sisters – the number who reach adulthood, the number that have died, the age at death, the year in which the death occurred, and whether the death was during pregnancy, childbirth or shortly afterwards. Maternal mortality estimates from the sisterhood method have been useful in situations in which there is no other reliable measurement of the level of maternal mortality and limited resources hinder other approaches for measuring maternal deaths. But, it has many limitations. Although the direct method does not rely on assumptions about the patterns of fertility, it is less appropriate for settings with low fertility (total fertility rate <3) or a high level of migration; insufficient precision renders it less effective in comparing geographic areas (i.e. comparing sub-national estimates), studying trends, evaluating programme impact or allocating resources. Its use for measuring and monitoring the progress of intervention programmes aimed at reducing maternal mortality is particularly constrained owing to the fact that it cannot provide current estimates.; ; Some of these limitations can be overcome with the motherhood method. It is a direct technique for deriving local population-based estimates of maternal mortality, which can also be used as multi-stage cluster-sample estimates for larger populations. The method involves estimating the same information within a geographic area as would be collected in a census, but without visiting every household. It is a targeted census of births and deaths within a defined study period.; ; It is an evolutionary variant of the Participatory Community Survey method, which was developed to measure neonatal tetanus and the perinatal mortality rate in rural Nepal8,9. It shares features with the Boerma and Mati’s “networking” approach10 of eliciting maternal deaths and MIMF (Maternal death from Informants and Maternal death Follow-on review)11, which relies on interviews with individual mothers. It differs, however, in eliciting deaths through group discussion of listed mothers and community health care providers. It derives information about the numerator and denominator of the measure of interest directly from groups of women within the study area who share motherhood status by virtue of having given birth. To implement the method, the local health volunteers assist in facilitating group discussions related to maternal and child health. Information on total births and maternal death during pregnancy, childbirth or puerperium is elicited through immunization registries, group discussions (FGD), peer memory, memory aids and interview-based diagnosis (verbal autopsy). In this study we field tested this method to measure maternal and child mortality in a district in Nepal.",133,1,64,69,Standardized mortality ratio; Demography; Pediatrics; Sisterhood method; Verbal autopsy; Population; Maternal death; Cause of death; Child mortality; Obstetric transition; Medicine,,Child; Child Mortality; Data Collection/methods; Developing Countries; Female; Humans; Infant; Interviews as Topic; Maternal Mortality; Mothers; Nepal; Registries; Reproducibility of Results; Residence Characteristics,,,https://www.ijmr.org.in/article.asp?issn=0971-5916;year=2011;volume=133;issue=1;spage=64;epage=69;aulast=Maskey https://www.rti.org/publication/field-test-results-motherhood-method-measure-maternal-mortality http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3100148 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21321421,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21321421,,1890652918,PMC3100148,0,013-824-044-618-165; 031-562-254-760-122; 046-760-521-279-475; 049-411-507-272-211; 104-906-428-156-64X; 162-276-376-078-298; 169-344-196-171-512,8,,(pii) indianjmedres_2011_133_1_64_76703; (magid) 1890652918; (pmcid) pmc3100148; (pmid) 21321421,en

Linux, Wikipedia or OpenStreetMap represent massive achievements that are changing our access to open software technology, knowledge and geoservices. These changes have also reached humanitarian response in front of man-made or natural disasters: digital humanitarians (DH) are given the chance to remotely help out those in urgent need, by accomplishing thousands of microtasks that augment the information about the disaster for those who work on the ground. However, the organisers and designers of these complex technological platforms need also to consider how to achieve larger, better, faster humanitarian reaction; as well as how to build, expand and maintain a volunteer community. This paper studies the temporal and geographical patterns of past online humanitarian response, and attempts to find clues that optimize the potentialities of a DH platform.Our findings suggest that the volunteers are strongly committed to the tasks: their contributions are submitted at a very fast pace, and they contribute repeatedly over time; also, such contribution is heavily driven by mass media coverage of the disaster: an increase in the media coverage is closely followed by an increase in the volunteers response. On the geographic side, there are large asymmetries regarding the origin of contributions, with a clear skew towards English-speaking areas.All these analysis outcomes inform us about human activity temporal and temporal patterns in very specific, unexplored context –time-constrained task accomplishing; additionally, such outcomes should rigorously inform future humanitarian technologies, and associated activities",159,,27,34,Engineering; Natural disaster; Geography; Data science; Pace; Solidarity; Humanitarian response; Media coverage; Operations research; Paradigm shift; Mass media; Crowdsourcing,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877705816322020 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877705816322020 https://core.ac.uk/display/82057050 https://cyberleninka.org/article/n/1437336 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82057050.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.proeng.2016.08.060,10.1016/j.proeng.2016.08.060,2520188171,,0,002-166-067-119-990; 038-853-210-617-804; 040-397-815-914-137; 064-945-595-706-98X; 084-045-814-788-797; 094-090-796-593-384; 104-035-868-719-804; 152-942-572-457-112,1,,(doi) 10.1016/j.proeng.2016.08.060; (magid) 2520188171; (coreid) 82057050,en

L. Liang; Alexander Zipf; Jamal Jokar Arsanjani,"Abstract: The increasing availability of sensor devices has resulted in important volumes of sensor data, which has raised the issue of making these data fully discoverable and interpretable by applications and end-users. The idea of OGC Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) has addressed this issue by proposing a set of standards to enable accessibility of sensor data over the Web. Similarly, there is a growing interest in volunteered geographic information (VGI). Considering that several researchers have highlighted the potential of this new type of information as a complement to existing, “traditional” data, it becomes important to develop frameworks to support the integration of VGI from several sources and with other types of data. In this paper, we make a first step in this direction by proposing a framework for the semantic interoperability of sensor data and VGI. After having performed an investigation of the types of VGI applications, we have developed a conceptual model of VGI aligned with relevant ISO standards for describing geospatial features. The purpose of this model is to support the generation of common descriptions for VGI applications, which will act as interfaces to higher-level services, such as discovery and reasoning services, in order to be exploited in conjunction with sensor data by client applications. This process is described through architecture for semantic interoperability of sensor data and VGI that we have developed and that we intend to use to set guidelines for future research on integration of VGI in sensor data cyberinfrastructures.

In this paper we investigated the impact of PV on land use in the area with the highest density of PV farms in Italy, i.e. the Province of Lecce (Southeastern Italy): here, such impact is expected to be maximum and has been the subject of public debate. In order to map all PV farms in detail, we used participative cartography, specifically OpenStreetMap (OSM), as data source. This international project collects geographic information (often gathered by people – i.e. the so-called Volunteered Geographic Information , VGI – using widely available technologies, such as smartphone built-in GPS), in order to create freely available global topographic maps. In this paper, we used the OSM platform to create a Geographical Information System (GIS) of PV farms in the Province of Lecce. Using GIS-based techniques, we estimated land use at the municipality level and created a density map of PV farms within the study area. Using the official land cover map Corine Land Cover of 2012, we also evaluated the main changes in land use. The results highlight the correlation between spatial distribution of PV farms and geographic variables (geomorphology, demographics, tourism, etc). We also show that land take by PV farms is quite marginal even in a region such as the Province of Lecce, where the density of PV installed power is among the highest available at the global level.",155,,434,444,Environmental resource management; Per capita; Renewable energy; Tourism; Geography; Land cover; Photovoltaic system; Land use; Topographic map; Volunteered geographic information,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038092X1730542X https://core.ac.uk/display/84677970 https://arts.units.it/handle/11368/2906240,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2017.06.046,10.1016/j.solener.2017.06.046,2662514601,,0,000-459-512-660-408; 001-795-263-587-703; 006-885-219-524-204; 011-531-842-726-994; 016-825-676-770-900; 017-282-369-741-50X; 017-518-735-691-484; 017-725-710-525-561; 020-550-523-238-950; 024-473-240-332-137; 040-612-337-798-037; 040-727-096-874-894; 042-505-620-117-822; 042-796-477-267-475; 046-509-496-371-690; 046-730-472-353-765; 049-555-253-221-467; 057-343-008-020-106; 057-545-918-303-995; 063-561-745-036-549; 072-243-912-426-29X; 093-940-555-265-015; 110-927-247-475-182; 124-227-000-835-466; 125-600-351-608-782; 133-001-652-401-713; 138-847-225-776-212; 142-239-807-653-250; 143-957-646-321-775; 151-673-900-475-215; 161-009-342-023-966; 165-119-001-068-405; 166-771-600-379-049; 182-758-965-060-982; 190-216-777-739-959,9,,(coreid) 84677970; (magid) 2662514601; (doi) 10.1016/j.solener.2017.06.046,en

This VGI may be of huge value for institutions, individuals and decision-makers, but only if it can be discovered, evaluated for quality and fitness-for-purpose and combined with data from other sources. If VGI data are to be discovered, used and reused to their full potential, they must be actively managed. In this chapter we assess the current state of the art regarding data management practices in VGI, identify some challenges, obstacles and best-practice examples, and review a range of developing and established open source technologies which can underpin robust and sustainable data management for VGI. We conclude that VGI is likely to remain patchy and heterogeneous and that existing standards may not be exploited to their full potential. Nevertheless, automated support for documenting the generation and use of VGI, as well as annotations following the Linked Data paradigm, can help to improve interoperability and reuse.

093-874-893-416-741,Open Source Web GIS Solutions in Disaster Management – with Special Emphasis on Inland Excess Water Modeling,2016-06-01,2016,journal article,Journal of Environmental Geography,2060467x,Walter de Gruyter GmbH,,Levente Juhász; Ádám Podolcsák; János Doleschall,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>; 				<jats:p> In recent years, the increased frequency of inland excess water in the Carpathian Basin gets more and more attention. The authors developed a web based pilot application for disaster management, with special emphasis on inland excess water hazard management. Free and open source software was used to generate a model, and our work was based on Web GIS standards (OGC), which makes further development possible. The developed Web GIS application provides functions to support the data collection regarding channels and ditches, and on-line hydrological analysis based on OGC Web Processing Services (WPS). Hydrological analysis aims to visualize the areas potentially at risk, depending on different precipitation quantities and various values of influencing factors. In order to run the prototype a sample data set was gathered including reference maps, technical parameters and current condition of canals and ditches. The methodology of crowdsourcing can produce valuable Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) that can fulfill the data requirements of disaster management applications. The prototype supports Crowdsourcing in the following aspects: free user access to the system’s analysis functionality, stakeholders may digitize the position of ditches, modify the status of the existing ditch system according to current conditions and add or modify parameters relevant for the analysis. The application demonstrated the usability of stakeholder generated geographic information and web processing for disaster management. The idea of integrating user-generated data into the various tasks of a disaster management agency is promising. However, maintaining data quality and standards compliance remain important issues.</jats:p>",9,1-2,15,21,Environmental resource management; Business; Excess water; Open source; Emergency management,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/91605116 https://content.sciendo.com/view/journals/jengeo/9/1-2/article-p15.xml?language=en,http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/jengeo-2016-0003,10.1515/jengeo-2016-0003,2512557597,,0,000-993-440-161-377; 032-903-495-847-439; 057-750-283-758-592; 071-876-019-311-661; 072-243-912-426-29X; 078-076-796-478-684; 078-460-486-926-118; 082-291-165-855-187; 098-829-040-208-448; 114-808-784-624-650; 118-743-254-642-377; 121-656-341-912-091; 122-624-663-376-156; 124-058-372-643-823; 132-311-823-975-445; 165-317-562-203-061,5,,(doi) 10.1515/jengeo-2016-0003; (coreid) 91605116; (magid) 2512557597,en

Among them, the OpenStreetMap project (OSM) has been very successful in collecting/offering volunteered geographic information (VGI). Very different behaviours are observed among OSM participants, which translate into large differences of lifespan, contribution levels (e.g. Nielsen’s 90–9-1 rule) and attitudes towards innovations (e.g. Diffusion of innovation theory or DoIT). So far, the literature has defined phases in the life cycle of contributors only based on the nature of their contributions (e.g. role of participants and edits characteristics). Our study identifies the different phases of their life cycle from a temporal perspective and assesses how these phases relate to the volume and the frequency of the contributions from participants.

Johnson,"City governments around the world are developing and expanding how they connect to citizens. Technologies play an important role in making this connection, and one frequent way that cities connect with citizens is through 311-style request systems. 311 is a non-emergency municipal notification system that uses telephone, email, web forms, and increasingly, mobile applications to allow citizens to notify government of infrastructure issues and make requests for municipal services. In many ways, this process of citizen contribution mirrors the provision of volunteered geographic information, that is spatially-referenced user generated content. This research presents a case study of the city of Edmonton, Canada, an early adopter of multi-channel 311 service request systems, including telephone, email, web form, and mobile app 311 request channels. Three methods of analysis are used to characterize and compare these different channels over three years of request data; a comparison of relative request share for each channel, a spatial hot spot analysis, and regression models to compare channel usage with sociodemographic variables. The results of this study indicate a shift in channel usage from traditional to Internet-enabled, that this shift is mirrored in the hotspots of request activity, and that specific digital inequalities exist that reinforce this distinction between traditional and Internet-enabled reporting channels.",1,2,18,31,User-generated content; Early adopter; Engineering; World Wide Web; Government; Communication channel; Digital divide; Municipal services; Notification system; Volunteered geographic information; Telecommunications,,,,,https://www.cogitatiopress.com/urbanplanning/article/view/621 https://libuwspaceprd02.uwaterloo.ca/handle/10012/11064 https://www.cogitatiopress.com/urbanplanning/article/download/621/621 https://doaj.org/article/2fa8717656c543ee9e7c510b8bf58e70 https://econpapers.repec.org/article/cogurbpla/v_3a1_3ay_3a2016_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a18-31.htm https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/handle/10012/11064 https://ideas.repec.org/a/cog/urbpla/v1y2016i2p18-31.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.17645/up.v1i2.621,10.17645/up.v1i2.621,2417732261,,0,002-541-598-896-889; 004-803-133-789-127; 014-260-183-064-524; 020-665-759-337-218; 022-702-439-254-352; 028-548-078-854-429; 031-302-647-555-751; 032-903-495-847-439; 046-509-496-371-690; 050-161-517-501-563; 057-357-333-577-597; 057-545-918-303-995; 057-603-499-849-872; 059-981-080-264-518; 066-336-138-162-728; 088-726-168-316-873; 090-636-221-923-414; 091-204-512-390-272; 097-612-174-011-049; 120-044-386-746-951; 126-648-069-884-299; 136-196-815-924-60X; 148-615-143-308-423,9,,(magid) 2417732261; (doi) 10.17645/up.v1i2.621,en

Langley; Joseph P. Messina; Nathan Moore,"Volunteered geographic information (VGI) has strong potential to be increasingly valuable to scientists in collaboration with non-scientists. The abundance of mobile phones and other wireless forms of communication open up significant opportunities for the public to get involved in scientific research. As these devices and activities become more abundant, questions of uncertainty and error in volunteer data are emerging as critical components for using volunteer-sourced spatial data. Here we present a methodology for using VGI and assessing its sensitivity to three types of error. More specifically, this study evaluates the reliability of data from volunteers based on their historical patterns. The specific context is a case study in surveillance of tsetse flies, a health concern for being the primary vector of African Trypanosomiasis. Reliability, as measured by a reputation score, determines the threshold for accepting the volunteered data for inclusion in a tsetse presence/absence model. Higher reputation scores are successful in identifying areas of higher modeled tsetse prevalence. A dynamic threshold is needed but the quality of VGI will improve as more data are collected and the errors in identifying reliable participants will decrease. This system allows for two-way communication between researchers and the public, and a way to evaluate the reliability of VGI. Boosting the public’s ability to participate in such work can improve disease surveillance and promote citizen science. In the absence of active surveillance, VGI can provide valuable spatial information given that the data are reliable.",16,1,1,11,Data mining; Health informatics; Spatial analysis; Citizen science; Health geography; Data science; Disease surveillance; Computer science; Geographic information system; Reputation; Volunteered geographic information,,Ecosystem; Geographic Information Systems/standards; Humans; Reproducibility of Results; Research Design/standards; Volunteers,,NIGMS NIH HHS (R21 GM084704) United States,https://ij-healthgeographics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12942-017-0113-9 https://doaj.org/article/d438548872d948ba94b0711deb41a963 https://ij-healthgeographics.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12942-017-0113-9 https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/PMC5674757 https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12942-017-0113-9 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29110677 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12942-017-0113-9 https://core.ac.uk/display/132173779,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12942-017-0113-9,10.1186/s12942-017-0113-9,2767688083,PMC5674757,0,002-289-130-158-571; 008-655-662-451-459; 014-012-972-325-552; 014-364-377-181-59X; 015-767-984-092-698; 019-153-446-879-994; 020-240-884-700-350; 020-241-105-547-516; 022-907-125-417-883; 032-903-495-847-439; 039-492-204-421-368; 040-267-517-107-219; 047-100-212-874-054; 047-229-121-484-621; 051-285-080-856-898; 051-672-609-357-192; 057-357-333-577-597; 057-545-918-303-995; 061-559-813-360-389; 062-834-046-545-322; 066-101-498-522-68X; 066-336-138-162-728; 072-243-912-426-29X; 079-413-893-273-040; 100-866-038-545-202; 101-853-476-992-575; 106-919-166-865-846; 126-014-508-205-215; 129-866-059-120-628; 135-360-535-210-851; 142-107-083-962-44X; 142-867-773-436-799; 144-096-391-736-702; 144-429-196-088-386; 166-717-292-919-682; 171-544-875-588-246; 173-404-096-898-892; 188-678-650-340-531; 195-019-623-135-107,10,,(pmcid) pmc5674757; (pmid) 29110677; (coreid) 132173779; (magid) 2767688083; (pii) 10.1186/s12942-017-0113-9; (doi) 10.1186/s12942-017-0113-9,en

The prevalence of hypertension is disproportionately higher in South Asian countries than in other regions of the world. Screening for hypertension in primary care settings remains a challenge in many South Asian countries, including Nepal. Nepal is located in the Himalayan Mountains region, posing significant geographical challenges for its rural citizens to access primary health care and service delivery. This barrier increases the costs and inconvenience for rural Nepalis to access hypertension screening and treatment. As a result, the prevalence of hypertension in Nepal tripled in the last 25 years to 22.4%-38.6%. Nepal's Ministry of Health and Population relies on female community health volunteers to link health centers and communities to provide basic health services. Over 50,000 of these volunteers in Nepal have received basic health care training and are assigned to take care of maternal and child health. Due to limited health care resources, adopting new methods to control hypertension is an urgent need in Nepal. Several recent studies in Nepal have recommended extending the role of female community health volunteers to include hypertension management through blood pressure monitoring and home-based education.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""OBJECTIVE"">The goal of this study was to assess if a mobile health-based female community health volunteer approach of combining the traditional community health volunteer program with digital technologies would be feasible and acceptable in rural Nepal.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">In this study, we recruited 17 female community health volunteers and extended their role from maternal and child health to hypertension management through screening blood pressures.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">All 17 female community health volunteers successfully measured 1113 rural Nepalis' blood pressures, identified 169 hypertensive patients, and collected health behaviors data of the 169 hypertensive patients.

Assessments are made of positional accuracy, completeness, and the experiences of citizen data collectors with reference to the official cadastral data and the land administration system. Ownership data were validated by crowd agreement. The outcomes of this research show the varying effects of volunteers, data collection method, geographical area, and application field, on geospatial data handling in the VGI arena. An overview of the many issues affecting the development and implementation of VGI projects is included. These are focused on the specific example of VGI data handling presented here: a case study area where instability and lack of resources are found alongside strong communities and a pressing need for more robust and effective official structures. The chosen example relates to the administration of land in an area of Iraq.",6,12,385,,Data collection; Cadastre; Group method of data handling; Usability; Geography; Data science; Land administration; Computer security; Volunteered geographic information; Global Positioning System; Geospatial analysis,,,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/6/12/385/pdf https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ijgi/ijgi6.html#HameedFS17 https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/6/12/385/htm https://core.ac.uk/display/132172361 https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/6491643 https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi6120385 https://eprint.ncl.ac.uk/238225,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi6120385,10.3390/ijgi6120385,2769020575,,0,001-295-692-604-478; 004-858-484-597-475; 007-684-128-166-136; 013-704-996-545-278; 015-576-334-059-042; 019-395-624-308-767; 020-240-884-700-350; 024-101-654-330-273; 026-645-756-189-301; 030-217-575-405-566; 034-296-402-405-270; 038-976-596-179-447; 057-545-918-303-995; 065-202-191-625-007; 073-652-094-513-327; 083-766-339-041-03X; 084-374-719-159-703; 088-263-897-772-088; 091-143-618-066-204; 097-612-174-011-049; 101-730-056-244-941; 103-859-285-040-344; 109-538-835-261-370; 116-772-579-628-047; 138-013-940-035-252; 138-847-225-776-212; 144-429-196-088-386; 147-539-342-970-008; 156-221-407-258-019; 158-847-532-778-731; 166-717-292-919-682,1,,(magid) 2769020575; (doi) 10.3390/ijgi6120385; (coreid) 132172361,en

Foody; M. Riffler; T. Gasber; Laurence Jolivet; A. Le Bris; Y. Meneroux; Lanfa Liu; M. Poupée; M. Gombert,"<jats:p>Land use and land cover (LULC) mapping is often undertaken by national mapping agencies, where these LULC products are used for different types of monitoring and reporting applications. Updating of LULC databases is often done on a multi-year cycle due to the high costs involved, so changes are only detected when mapping exercises are repeated. Consequently, the information on LULC can quickly become outdated and hence may be incorrect in some areas. In the current era of big data and Earth observation, change detection algorithms can be used to identify changes in urban areas, which can then be used to automatically update LULC databases on a more continuous basis. However, the change detection algorithm must be validated before the changes can be committed to authoritative databases such as those produced by national mapping agencies. This paper outlines a change detection algorithm for identifying construction sites, which represent ongoing changes in LU, developed in the framework of the LandSense project. We then use volunteered geographic information (VGI) captured through the use of mapathons from a range of different groups of contributors to validate these changes. In total, 105 contributors were involved in the mapathons, producing a total of 2778 observations. The 105 contributors were grouped according to six different user-profiles and were analyzed to understand the impact of the experience of the users on the accuracy assessment. Overall, the results show that the change detection algorithm is able to identify changes in residential land use to an adequate level of accuracy (85%) but changes in infrastructure and industrial sites had lower accuracies (57% and 75 %, respectively), requiring further improvements. In terms of user profiles, the experts in LULC from local authorities, researchers in LULC at the French national mapping agency (IGN), and first-year students with a basic knowledge of geographic information systems had the highest overall accuracies (86.2%, 93.2%, and 85.2%, respectively). Differences in how the users approach the task also emerged, e.g., local authorities used knowledge and context to try to identify types of change while those with no knowledge of LULC (i.e., normal citizens) were quicker to choose ‘Unknown’ when the visual interpretation of a class was more difficult.</jats:p>",12,7,1186,,Change detection; Data science; Land cover; Urban land; Earth observation; Computer science; Geographic information system; Land use; Volunteered geographic information; Big data,,,,Directorate-General for Migration and Home Affairs,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/remotesensing/remotesensing12.html#RaimondSSFRGJBM20 https://www.scilit.net/article/5ea67a850e4728a41d51fb405efaa779 https://doi.org/10.3390/rs12071186 https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02865040 http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/16406/ https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020RemS...12.1186O/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs12071186,10.3390/rs12071186,3016014728,,0,000-763-551-186-020; 003-677-713-873-99X; 004-884-167-523-092; 005-168-563-805-744; 012-888-691-551-565; 013-351-102-922-329; 017-105-469-570-579; 017-465-705-893-310; 018-820-733-510-460; 019-362-199-226-515; 020-045-045-771-226; 020-628-374-299-182; 021-158-340-549-596; 031-705-072-092-608; 031-823-963-856-699; 033-576-088-883-310; 038-976-596-179-447; 040-153-427-612-881; 041-631-857-152-563; 042-593-973-586-483; 049-847-403-314-760; 052-683-405-854-517; 057-545-918-303-995; 058-056-869-736-063; 060-385-251-746-891; 068-746-185-815-183; 069-278-247-676-345; 079-739-411-037-089; 080-156-480-293-52X; 081-009-147-077-168; 082-592-402-043-887; 084-374-719-159-703; 088-339-711-439-200; 088-452-227-475-191; 088-930-415-870-096; 092-752-237-319-802; 095-806-518-741-129; 099-021-469-743-368; 099-523-636-461-537; 100-174-367-058-352; 101-876-710-642-146; 103-995-222-122-576; 106-610-662-804-983; 112-712-967-351-975; 113-184-876-303-935; 123-421-810-007-34X; 128-630-302-259-009; 130-069-374-448-854; 132-348-001-538-712; 135-428-171-992-714; 135-983-750-182-559; 143-759-476-844-743; 148-251-448-555-471; 154-105-460-457-913; 155-352-276-423-259; 170-071-021-746-77X; 182-784-850-556-071; 184-053-454-081-768; 190-569-872-859-768,2,,(doi) 10.3390/rs12071186; (magid) 3016014728,fr; en

These changes necessitate considerable modifications of the energy infrastructure. Even though most of these modifications are inherently motivated by geospatial questions and challenges, the integration of energy system models and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) is still in its infancy. This paper analyzes the shortcomings of previous approaches in using GIS in renewable energy-related projects, extracts distinct challenges from these previous efforts and, finally, defines a set of core future research avenues for GIS-based energy infrastructure planning with a focus on the use of renewable energy. These future research avenues comprise the availability base data and their ""geospatial awareness"", the development of a generic and unified data model, the usage of volunteered geographic information (VGI) and crowdsourced data in analysis processes, the integration of 3D building models and 3D data analysis, the incorporation of network topologies into GIS, the harmonization of the heterogeneous views on aggregation issues in the fields of energy and GIS, fine-grained energy demand estimation from freely-available data sources, decentralized storage facility planning, the investigation of GIS-based public participation mechanisms, the transition from purely structural to operational planning, data privacy aspects and, finally, the development of a new dynamic power market design",3,2,662,692,Risk analysis (engineering); Renewable energy; Operational planning; Computer science; Geographic information system; Energy engineering; Management science; Volunteered geographic information; Enterprise GIS; Energy carrier; Geospatial analysis,,,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/3/2/662/pdf https://doaj.org/article/0d6998317e7b4bd789774ffb53f3ed9e https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ijgi/ijgi3.html#ReschSTBEHNG14 https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/6490402 http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi3020662 http://core.ac.uk/display/27202825 https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi3020662 https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi3020662 https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/3/2/662 https://uni-salzburg.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/gis-based-planning-and-modeling-for-renewable-energy-challenges-a http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014IJGI....3..662R/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi3020662,10.3390/ijgi3020662,2081160624,,0,000-360-942-679-248; 001-003-406-939-879; 001-452-515-991-899; 003-048-156-803-283; 005-820-970-623-416; 006-244-002-277-994; 006-819-919-095-61X; 006-996-931-640-243; 007-594-043-744-364; 007-807-373-862-423; 008-285-141-416-062; 010-024-175-640-106; 010-157-021-953-010; 010-857-789-578-85X; 011-226-643-050-142; 011-241-717-579-539; 012-039-294-423-803; 013-119-111-595-159; 013-917-591-812-533; 014-791-006-117-173; 015-351-803-143-937; 016-660-841-740-930; 016-863-751-860-349; 018-512-685-422-209; 019-019-066-826-893; 023-866-070-526-721; 024-459-543-486-183; 028-604-421-272-316; 030-416-570-557-01X; 030-978-610-618-097; 032-411-994-195-569; 037-553-690-415-660; 038-394-319-120-527; 039-622-764-350-214; 040-308-331-710-579; 040-774-882-935-406; 041-090-318-561-908; 043-168-057-633-490; 044-980-113-966-980; 045-426-166-748-192; 046-078-484-071-883; 046-432-485-775-785; 048-003-535-892-865; 049-096-353-208-737; 051-724-291-427-745; 051-841-288-279-107; 052-300-019-471-090; 053-081-855-099-238; 053-394-499-836-875; 054-715-769-895-711; 057-133-971-061-066; 057-150-968-624-993; 057-545-918-303-995; 058-109-437-748-665; 058-917-369-807-584; 060-280-775-311-775; 061-487-072-243-387; 065-009-112-262-152; 066-336-868-314-578; 066-737-977-317-492; 071-280-962-946-265; 075-082-144-125-500; 076-270-312-118-102; 077-906-545-026-783; 078-820-609-831-183; 080-348-599-898-354; 080-491-772-002-446; 082-550-762-385-455; 082-678-350-463-675; 083-828-815-435-402; 085-524-631-168-960; 088-604-529-724-43X; 091-575-813-318-541; 092-035-316-870-625; 095-606-319-970-635; 097-550-119-382-284; 097-797-168-645-831; 100-218-219-356-165; 100-318-844-910-932; 103-476-258-402-364; 103-760-624-298-172; 105-916-282-489-163; 108-411-205-753-608; 110-454-750-194-882; 111-420-905-224-451; 115-564-837-924-058; 116-240-459-418-048; 117-434-310-454-165; 120-397-332-889-07X; 121-133-220-513-294; 122-604-318-036-11X; 122-762-033-837-419; 125-779-715-281-497; 127-200-426-128-805; 128-306-921-413-269; 129-140-177-914-709; 130-381-469-923-693; 131-966-369-840-946; 132-182-032-780-774; 133-967-969-146-242; 135-552-003-539-759; 136-215-543-491-29X; 136-789-235-079-896; 139-802-201-848-311; 140-780-579-869-633; 143-648-381-488-094; 143-860-977-683-85X; 145-418-964-249-983; 159-501-503-123-742; 160-717-333-322-48X; 163-495-155-953-438; 166-265-202-701-934; 169-023-269-979-364; 183-715-237-382-058; 184-453-948-747-294; 193-154-098-955-500; 198-912-000-734-905,66,,(coreid) 56767593; (doi) 10.3390/ijgi3020662; (magid) 2081160624,en

Roth,"Geographic information increasingly is produced and consumed on mobile devices. The rise of mobile mapping is challenging traditional design conventions in research, industry, and education, and cartographers and GIScientists now need to accommodate this mobile context. This entry introduces emerging design considerations for mobile maps. First, the technical enablements and constraints that make mobile devices unique are described, including Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers and other sensors, reduced screensize and resolution, reduced processing power and memory capacity, less reliable data connectivity, reduced bandwidth, and physical mobility through variable environmental conditions. Scholarly influences on mobile mapping also are reviewed, including location-based services, adaptive cartography, volunteered geographic information, and locational privacy. Next, two strategies for creating mobile maps are introduced—mobile apps installed onto mobile operating systems versus responsive web maps that work on mobile and nonmobile devices—and core concepts of responsive web design are reviewed, including fluid grids, media queries, breakpoints, and frameworks. Finally, emerging design recommendations for mobile maps are summarized, with representation design adaptations needed to account for reduced screensizes and bandwidth and interaction design adaptations needed to account for multi-touch interaction and post-WIMP interfaces.",2018,Q2,,,Human–computer interaction; Mobile interaction; Interaction design; Mobile device; Mobile mapping; Computer science; Responsive web design; Volunteered geographic information; Global Positioning System; Bandwidth (signal processing),,,,,https://research.utwente.nl/en/publications/mobile-maps-and-responsive-design https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Aris.utwente.nl%3Apublications%2Fcc5aceff-4ee3-4cb6-9383-c9165de31d48,http://dx.doi.org/10.22224/gistbok/2018.2.5,10.22224/gistbok/2018.2.5,2805932548,,0,,10,,(doi) 10.22224/gistbok/2018.2.5; (magid) 2805932548,en

Parker; Andrew May; Val Mitchell,"<AbstractText Label=""UNLABELLED"">This paper investigates the influence of presenting volunteered and professionally created geographic information to 101 wheelchair users through an interactive website that included information collected by wheelchair-using volunteers. The aim of this experiment was to understand the influence that (1) knowing a map-based website contains volunteered information and (2) actually including volunteered information within an online interactive map (a mashup) have on the perceived trust of the user, described in terms of quality and authority. Analysis using Kruskal-Wallis showed that judgements of currency were influenced by including geo-information from untrained volunteers (volunteered geographic information) within the mashup, but not influenced by the participant being told that the online map contained volunteered information. The participants appeared to make judgements based on what information they saw, rather than what they were told about the source of the information.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""PRACTITIONER SUMMARY"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">Since 2004, information services have combined crowdsourced (volunteered) alongside professional information within online interactive maps.

Ostermann; Rob Lemmens,"The emergence of volunteered geographic information (VGI) during the past decade has fueled a wide range of research and applications. The assessment of VGI quality and fitness-of-use is still a challenge because of the non-standardized and crowdsourced data collection process, as well as the unknown skill and motivation of the contributors. However, the frequent approach of assessing VGI quality against external data sources using ISO quality standard measures is problematic because of a frequent lack of available external (reference) data, and because for certain types of features, VGI might be more up-to-date than the reference data. Therefore, a VGI-intrinsic measure of quality is highly desirable. This study proposes such an intrinsic measure of quality by developing the concept of aggregated expertise based on the characteristics of a feature's contributors. The article further operationalizes this concept and examines its feasibility through a case study using OpenStreetMap (OSM). The comparison of model OSM feature quality with information from a field survey demonstrates the successful implementation of this novel approach.",22,3,823,841,Data collection; Data science; Credibility; Reference data (financial markets); Quality standard; Field survey; External data; Computer science; Volunteered geographic information,,,,"graduate scholarship from Indonesia Endowment Fund for Education (LPDP), Republic of Indonesia",https://www.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tgis.12454 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/tgis/tgis22.html#MuttaqienOL18 https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Aris.utwente.nl%3Apublications%2Fdf5ce057-213e-4ce2-8c12-6145b44e02a1 https://research.utwente.nl/en/publications/modeling-aggregated-expertise-of-user-contributions-to-assess-the https://doi.org/10.1111/tgis.12454,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tgis.12454,10.1111/tgis.12454,2885839651,,0,000-756-236-294-499; 017-614-610-102-13X; 021-041-484-242-674; 022-473-450-579-960; 030-975-962-975-895; 038-976-596-179-447; 040-267-517-107-219; 048-400-414-195-536; 051-285-080-856-898; 057-545-918-303-995; 097-773-332-306-457; 138-241-697-486-751; 147-876-713-700-216; 161-869-067-673-250; 171-544-875-588-246; 190-216-777-739-959,5,,(magid) 2885839651; (doi) 10.1111/tgis.12454,en

Codd; Gerard Bury,"<AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"">Mobilization of community first responders (CFRs) to the scene of an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) event has been proposed as a means of shortening the interval from occurrence of cardiac arrest to performance of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation, thereby increasing patient survival.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""OBJECTIVES"">To assess the effect of mobilizing community first responders (CFRs) to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest events in adults and children older than four weeks of age, in terms of survival and neurological function.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""SEARCH METHODS"">We searched the following databases for relevant trials in January 2019: CENTRAL, MEDLINE (Ovid SP), Embase (Ovid SP), and Web of Science. We also searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov, and we scanned the abstracts of conference proceedings of the American Heart Association and the European Resuscitation Council.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""SELECTION CRITERIA"">We included randomized and quasi-randomized trials (RCTs and q-RCTs) that compared routine emergency medical services (EMS) care versus EMS care plus mobilization of CFRs in instances of OHCA.Trials with randomization by cluster were eligible for inclusion, including cluster-design studies with intervention cross-over.In some communities, the statutory ambulance service/EMS is routinely provided by the local fire service. For the purposes of this review, this group represents the statutory ambulance service/EMS, as distinct from CFRs, and was not included as an eligible intervention.We did not include studies primarily focused on opportunistic bystanders. Individuals who were present at the scene of an OHCA event and who performed CPR according to telephone instruction provided by EMS call takers were not considered to be CFRs.Studies primarily assessing the impact of specific additional interventions such as administration of naloxone in narcotic overdose or adrenaline in anaphylaxis were also excluded.We included adults and children older than four weeks of age who had experienced an OHCA.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS"">Two review authors independently reviewed all titles and abstracts received to assess potential eligibility, using set inclusion criteria. We obtained and examined in detail full-text copies of all papers considered potentially eligible, and we approached authors of trials for additional information when necessary. We summarized the process of study selection in a PRISMA flowchart.Three review authors independently extracted relevant data using a standard data extraction form and assessed the validity of each included trial using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We resolved disagreements by discussion and consensus.We synthesized findings in narrative fashion due to the heterogeneity of the included studies. We used the principles of the GRADE system to assess the certainty of the body of evidence associated with specific outcomes and to construct a 'Summary of findings' table.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""MAIN RESULTS"">We found two completed studies involving a total of 1136 participants that ultimately met our inclusion criteria. We also found one ongoing study and one planned study. We noted significant heterogeneity in the characteristics of interventions and outcomes measured or reported across these studies, thus we could not pool study results.One completed study considered the dispatch of police and fire service CFRs equipped with automatic external defibrillators (AEDs) in an EMS system in Amsterdam and surrounding areas. This study was an RCT with allocation made by cluster according to non-overlapping geographical regions. It was conducted between 5 January 2000 and 5 January 2002. All participants were 18 years of age or older and had experienced witnessed OHCA. The study found no difference in survival at hospital discharge (odds ratio (OR) 1.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.8 to 2.2; 1 RCT; 469 participants; low-certainty evidence), despite the observation that all 72 incidences of defibrillation performed before EMS arrival occurred in the intervention group (OR and 95% CI - not applicable; 1 RCT; 469 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). This study reported increased survival to hospital admission in the intervention group (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.0; 1 RCT; 469 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).The second completed study considered the dispatch of nearby lay volunteers in Stockholm, Sweden, who were trained to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). This represented a supplementary CFR intervention in an EMS system where police and fire services were already routinely dispatched to OHCA in addition to EMS ambulances. This study, an RCT, included both witnessed and unwitnessed OHCA and was conducted between 1 April 2012 and 1 December 2013. Participants included adults and children eight years of age and older. Researchers found no difference in 30-day survival (OR 1.34, 95% CI 0.79 to 2.29; 1 RCT; 612 participants; low-certainty evidence), despite a significant increase in CPR performed before EMS arrival (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.03; 1 RCT; 665 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).Neither of the included completed studies considered neurological function at hospital discharge or at 30 days, measured by cerebral performance category or by any other means. Neither of the included completed studies considered health-related quality of life. The overall certainty of evidence for the outcomes of included studies was low to moderate.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS"">Moderate-certainty evidence shows that context-specific CFR interventions result in increased rates of CPR or defibrillation performed before EMS arrival. It remains uncertain whether this can translate to significantly increased rates of overall patient survival. When possible, further high-quality RCTs that are adequately powered to measure changes in survival should be conducted.The included studies did not consider survival with good neurological function. This outcome is likely to be important to patients and should be included routinely wherever survival is measured.We identified one ongoing study and one planned trial whose results once available may change the results of this review. As this review was limited to randomized and quasi-randomized trials, we may have missed some important data from other study types.</AbstractText>",7,7,CD012764,,Quality of life; Odds ratio; Randomized controlled trial; Emergency medicine; Psychological intervention; Cardiopulmonary resuscitation; MEDLINE; Clinical trial; Emergency medical services; Medicine,,Adult; Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation/methods; Child; Electric Countershock; Emergency Medical Services; Emergency Responders; Humans; Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest/mortality; Quality of Health Care; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Survival Analysis,,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31323120/ https://www.cochranelibrary.com/content?templateType=full&urlTitle=/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD012764.pub2&doi=10.1002/14651858.CD012764.pub2&type=cdsr&contentLanguage= https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/enfermeria/resource/es/mdl-31323120 https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd012764.pub2 https://researchrepository.ucd.ie/handle/10197/11236 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31323120 http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd012764.pub2 https://researchrepository.ucd.ie/bitstream/10197/11236/2/Community%20first%20responders%20for%20out-of-hospital%20cardiac%20arrest%20in%20adults%20and%20children.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd012764.pub2,10.1002/14651858.cd012764.pub2,2964039837,PMC6641654,0,000-442-516-942-284; 005-748-557-185-068; 006-060-458-687-952; 006-530-828-546-529; 006-838-128-362-754; 007-956-573-484-710; 008-111-114-375-031; 008-112-148-000-531; 008-854-350-375-532; 009-626-497-288-881; 009-659-686-885-176; 017-300-737-144-757; 018-092-752-454-14X; 019-723-770-538-368; 020-587-023-415-024; 030-713-838-137-640; 032-872-304-032-669; 035-986-743-931-425; 039-167-305-725-839; 039-266-034-303-311; 040-312-141-801-930; 041-874-869-056-209; 042-602-851-067-767; 043-646-847-476-323; 044-349-280-978-327; 047-953-162-006-500; 048-660-360-871-500; 049-240-409-396-698; 053-112-184-189-687; 054-176-606-277-169; 058-461-805-701-119; 059-528-632-115-68X; 064-001-411-954-834; 064-359-657-610-624; 066-326-057-353-662; 092-034-151-721-941; 097-637-855-975-581; 098-548-168-402-732; 098-711-765-127-318; 120-182-066-841-752; 127-445-380-588-771; 138-774-540-181-29X,8,"research support, non-u.s. gov't; systematic review",(magid) 2964039837; (pmid) 31323120; (doi) 10.1002/14651858.cd012764.pub2; (pmcid) pmc6641654,en

The exploitation, integration and application of these sources, termed volunteered geographic information (VGI) or crowdsourced geographic information (CGI), offer scientists an unprecedented opportunity to conduct research on a variety of topics at multiple scales and for diversified objectives.\ud; The Handbook is organized in five parts, addressing the fundamental questions: What motivates citizens to provide such information in the public domain, and what factors govern/predict its validity?What methods might be used to validate such information? Can VGI be framed within the larger domain of sensor networks, in which inert and static sensors are replaced or combined by intelligent and mobile humans equipped with sensing devices? What limitations are imposed on VGI by differential access to broadband Internet, mobile phones, and other communication technologies, and by concerns over privacy? How do VGI and crowdsourcing enable innovation applications to benefit human society?\ud; Chapters examine how crowdsourcing techniques and methods, and the VGI phenomenon, have motivated a multidisciplinary research community to identify both fields of applications and quality criteria depending on the use of VGI. Besides harvesting tools and storage of these data, research has paid remarkable attention to these information resources, in an age when information and participation is one of the most important drivers of development.\ud; The collection opens questions and points to new research directions in addition to the findings that each of the authors demonstrates.

The geographic extent of defence data covers the world, with greater focus directed towards areas considered to be of current interest. Traditionally, these data have been officially sourced, e.g. via National Mapping Agencies, but there is now increasing interest in the potential of crowdsourced geographic data to supplement authoritative data where they are not available, outdated or incomplete. Volunteered geographic information (VGI) and social media have the potential to provide this needed missing information. This paper presents initial work carried out in identifying the potential of crowdsourced geographic information in defence. We first provide a short description of the role of UK defence and review the existing literature on crowdsourced geographic information in defence, as well as generic VGI quality assessment methods. We then explore the potential of crowdsourced data in real-world applications: the conflation of VGI and social media with official data for effective decision-making in war zones, and the potential for crowdsourcing to increase effective collaboration between machines and humans in disaster situations. Based on our review, we outline specific research challenges for deploying crowdsourced geographic information in defence, focussing on data quality and fitness-for-purpose assessment. Defence-specific constraints include the need for rapid quality assessment processes and the need to communicate high-quality information effectively in situations where rapid decision-making is required. Ethical issues are also of fundamental importance.",21,1,133,160,Conflation; Situation awareness; Political science; Data quality; Data science; Social media; Humanitarian aid; Volunteered geographic information; Crowdsourcing; Emergency management,,,,Defence Science and Technology Laboratory; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10109-018-0282-5 https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10061750/ https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019JGS....21..133P/abstract https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/jgs/jgs21.html#PapapesiosESH19 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10109-018-0282-5.pdf https://ideas.repec.org/a/kap/jgeosy/v21y2019i1d10.1007_s10109-018-0282-5.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10109-018-0282-5,10.1007/s10109-018-0282-5,2905143927,,0,001-117-752-253-058; 017-465-705-893-310; 018-044-890-257-973; 020-132-620-861-048; 023-248-211-445-928; 029-432-255-251-103; 030-975-962-975-895; 031-321-919-381-403; 031-624-147-803-511; 032-353-715-439-039; 034-820-796-236-905; 036-981-652-060-138; 038-976-596-179-447; 039-364-366-053-645; 040-267-517-107-219; 041-312-632-078-632; 043-177-249-841-926; 043-184-067-753-47X; 045-463-728-727-856; 046-125-346-020-083; 048-400-414-195-536; 048-702-561-381-148; 050-902-903-071-018; 057-545-918-303-995; 059-506-034-265-023; 060-630-279-439-179; 065-202-191-625-007; 066-101-498-522-68X; 066-336-138-162-728; 067-613-663-654-148; 071-512-891-437-470; 071-997-361-041-485; 074-892-757-433-950; 079-647-873-088-069; 083-620-190-871-884; 084-397-468-164-699; 086-758-442-428-039; 088-339-711-439-200; 095-523-941-068-840; 100-129-260-634-476; 109-104-118-930-131; 112-869-857-324-306; 118-960-327-305-04X; 121-086-868-408-48X; 124-043-027-110-303; 125-140-623-780-937; 127-491-841-235-58X; 128-630-302-259-009; 129-436-944-141-958; 135-826-459-417-405; 136-982-265-048-93X; 139-361-702-238-051; 169-004-007-623-620; 171-544-875-588-246; 190-216-777-739-959; 191-065-861-771-389; 197-866-181-140-194,2,,(magid) 2905143927; (doi) 10.1007/s10109-018-0282-5,en

It gives context to users operating location-based applications, provides an important source of documentation of buildings and can be of value to computer systems where an understanding of environment is required. Unlike external geographic spaces, no centralised body or agency is charged with collecting or maintaining such information. Widespread deployment of mobile devices provides a potential tool that would allow rapid model capture and update by a building's users. Here we introduce some of the issues involved in volunteering building interior data and outline a simple mobile tool for capture of indoor models.

Effective disaster management is a core feature for the protection of communities against natural disasters such as floods. Disaster management organizations (DMOs) are expected to contribute to ensuring this protection. However, what happens when their resources to cope with a flood are at stake or the intensity and frequency of the event exceeds their capacities? Many cities in the Free State of Saxony, Germany, were strongly hit by several floods in the last years and are additionally challenged by demographic change, with an ageing society and out-migration leading to population shrinkage in many parts of Saxony. Disaster management, which is mostly volunteer-based in Germany, is particularly affected by this change, leading to a loss of members. We propose an agent-based simulation model that acts as a ""virtual lab"" to explore the impact of various changes on disaster management performance. Using different scenarios we examine the impact of changes in personal resources of DMOs, their access to operation relevant information, flood characteristics as well as differences between geographic regions. A loss of DMOs and associated manpower caused by demographic change has the most profound impact on the performance. Especially in rural, upstream regions population decline in combination with very short lead times can put disaster management performance at risk.",16,10,2287,2301,Engineering; Natural disaster; Population decline; Population; Demographic change; Ageing society; Free state; Simulation; Emergency management; Flood myth; Environmental planning,,,,European Commission,http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016NHESS..16.2287D/abstract https://nhess.copernicus.org/articles/16/2287/2016/ http://www.nat-hazards-earth-syst-sci.net/16/2287/2016/nhess-16-2287-2016.pdf https://www.nat-hazards-earth-syst-sci.net/16/2287/2016/nhess-16-2287-2016-relations.html https://nhess.copernicus.org/articles/16/2287/2016/nhess-16-2287-2016.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/nhess-16-2287-2016,10.5194/nhess-16-2287-2016,2283086425,,0,002-014-280-525-354; 003-210-205-233-890; 005-079-988-147-682; 007-098-242-549-18X; 009-309-411-734-002; 009-950-816-224-661; 011-378-804-895-174; 013-560-502-433-314; 016-800-994-000-708; 024-943-330-196-179; 027-946-558-916-702; 028-470-708-069-410; 033-625-934-379-77X; 040-667-985-700-040; 052-553-836-390-050; 054-610-797-662-244; 062-853-106-656-504; 063-448-287-070-066; 064-053-186-811-574; 069-021-503-509-404; 069-630-544-556-040; 070-081-674-016-102; 071-178-505-877-777; 071-278-957-764-958; 071-801-118-790-294; 072-291-368-210-706; 081-668-079-468-78X; 086-007-152-437-642; 088-051-264-531-861; 097-103-856-399-866; 099-315-829-138-270; 101-451-494-001-083; 115-262-163-556-59X; 132-246-550-138-466; 135-191-755-820-50X; 152-775-044-462-764; 152-973-938-092-616; 158-560-118-991-002; 169-001-964-695-120,6,,(coreid) 132191372; (magid) 2283086425; (doi) 10.5194/nhess-16-2287-2016,en

This paper presents a methodology for assessing positional and shape quality for authoritative large-scale data, such as Ordnance Survey (OS) UK data and General Directorate for Survey (GDS) Iraq data, and Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI), such as OpenStreetMap (OSM) data, with the intention of assessing possible integration. It is based on the measurement of discrepancies among the datasets, addressing positional accuracy and shape fidelity, using standard procedures and also directional statistics. Line feature comparison has been undertaken using buffering techniques and statistics, whilst shape metrics, including moments invariant, have been applied to assess polygon matching. The analyses are presented with a user-friendly interface which eases data input, computation and output of results, and assists in interpretation of the comparison. The results show that a comparison of positional and shape characteristics of OS data or GDS data, with those of OSM data, indicates that their integration for large scale mapping applications is not viable",2,2,349,370,Data mining; Polygon; Geography; Information retrieval; Data quality; Fidelity; Directional statistics; Computation; Collaborative mapping; Volunteered geographic information; Geospatial analysis,,,,,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi2020349 http://core.ac.uk/display/26399024 https://eprint.ncl.ac.uk/190947 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ijgi/ijgi2.html#FairbairnA13 https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/2/2/349/pdf https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/2/2/349 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013IJGI....2..349F/abstract https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi2020349,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi2020349,10.3390/ijgi2020349,2051064149,,0,000-570-185-867-297; 008-714-358-699-609; 009-014-462-640-411; 012-657-537-842-77X; 019-526-471-020-259; 019-965-219-748-250; 023-698-395-641-63X; 027-736-997-184-595; 032-903-495-847-439; 038-976-596-179-447; 039-467-318-196-90X; 040-841-356-818-207; 056-410-247-122-67X; 057-343-008-020-106; 057-630-066-322-323; 062-663-450-686-553; 065-306-536-273-534; 067-793-529-827-539; 075-796-006-914-012; 077-776-126-525-825; 088-339-711-439-200; 091-143-618-066-204; 094-257-679-521-092; 109-600-892-221-302; 116-003-114-467-005; 116-910-115-820-930; 119-026-256-853-834; 120-348-450-238-234; 131-142-984-179-959; 138-860-407-898-807; 138-892-897-078-698; 149-692-542-021-839; 170-277-094-171-886; 178-022-391-465-270; 182-599-832-845-051,28,,(coreid) 28405200; (magid) 2051064149; (doi) 10.3390/ijgi2020349,en

Enhanced communication is recommended among PD stakeholders in regional NSW. This study provided a microcosmic view of the issues revealed by the very limited literature available on Australia's rural and regional healthcare delivery to PWP and their carers. It highlighted the lack of health staff, funding and information for relevant stakeholders, as well as PWP's desire for increased input from medical practitioners and the ancillary sectors. While this study did not directly compare rural with metropolitan PD services, it was inferred from all participant groups that regional and rural areas are disadvantaged in terms of medical staff and facilities, hindering timely diagnosis, management and treatment. The findings have implications for all stakeholders in the care of rural patients with PD.</AbstractText>",11,4,1658,,Epidemiology; Rural area; Psychology; Metropolitan area; Nursing; Disease; Dementia; Disadvantaged; Focus group; Location,,Caregivers; Delivery of Health Care; Female; Focus Groups; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Male; New South Wales; Parkinson Disease/drug therapy; Patient Care Team; Rural Population,,,https://www.rrh.org.au/journal/article/1658 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22032468,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22032468,,2188213686,,0,001-338-600-227-968; 002-522-052-919-328; 013-999-068-412-238; 036-009-268-967-392; 039-909-001-438-507; 044-067-098-820-675; 052-284-678-349-665; 058-498-101-452-344; 058-694-790-382-502; 091-893-784-599-180; 093-465-212-213-838; 097-000-860-202-737; 106-184-008-593-879; 108-958-669-427-383; 111-562-271-349-407; 137-947-819-508-807; 138-314-584-131-924; 147-469-477-993-759,9,"research support, non-u.s. gov't",(pmid) 22032468; (pii) 1658; (magid) 2188213686,en

Studies have shown that this spatial data varies significantly in terms of its geometric quality, its semantic consistency, in terms of its comprehensiveness of coverage and in terms of its currency. Subsequently it often compares poorly with the authoritative data capture and mapping undertaken by national mapping agencies and commercial companies. In this paper we highlight a specific type of problem encountered with volunteered geographic information (VGI) – the naming of real-world features.

Most landscape description methods underline salient entities which are a key trigger for wayfinding problems and tourism management. Searching for a better understanding of landscape descriptions implies to explore and identify the main visual properties that differentiate between landscapes depending on both human cognition and environmental condition. Furthermore, this environmental condition affects the credibility of data produced by people, particularly when using Volunteered Geographical Information systems which brings forward a huge amount of information.

In addition, collecting statistics on typhoon disaster situations is hard work for the government. At the same time, near-real-time disaster-related information can be obtained on developed social media platforms like Twitter and Weibo. Many cases have proved that citizens are able to organize themselves promptly on the spot, and begin to share disaster information when a disaster strikes, producing massive VGI (volunteered geographic information) about the disaster situation, which could be valuable for disaster response if this VGI could be exploited efficiently and properly. However, this social media information has features such as large quantity, high noise, and unofficial modes of expression that make it difficult to obtain useful information. In order to solve this problem, we first designed a new classification system based on the characteristics of social medial data like Sina Weibo data, and made a microblogging dataset of typhoon damage with according category labels. Secondly, we used this social medial dataset to train the deep learning model, and constructed a typhoon disaster mining model based on a deep learning network, which could automatically extract information about the disaster situation. The model is different from the general classification system in that it automatically selected microblogs related to disasters from a large number of microblog data, and further subdivided them into different types of disasters to facilitate subsequent emergency response and loss estimation. The advantages of the model included a wide application range, high reliability, strong pertinence and fast speed. The research results of this thesis provide a new approach to typhoon disaster assessment in the southeastern coastal areas of China, and provide the necessary information for the authoritative information acquisition channel.</jats:p>",7,9,318,,Deep learning; Microblogging; Government; Artificial intelligence; Communication channel; Typhoon; Data science; Disaster assessment; Computer science; Social media; Volunteered geographic information,,,,National Key Research and Development Program of China,https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1312/7/9/318 https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1312/7/9/318/pdf https://eprint.ncl.ac.uk/260197,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jmse7090318,10.3390/jmse7090318,2973107877,,0,009-687-031-362-081; 015-826-745-723-509; 017-935-647-747-422; 019-678-365-860-062; 034-088-583-689-092; 055-198-271-559-01X; 057-545-918-303-995; 075-179-108-062-152; 077-058-411-545-28X; 085-693-800-813-674; 089-092-368-058-615; 101-996-182-153-862; 124-043-027-110-303; 189-149-579-234-826,5,,(magid) 2973107877; (doi) 10.3390/jmse7090318,en

Particularly in natural resource management, Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) is increasingly recognized as a significant resource, for example, supporting visitation pattern analysis to evaluate collective values and improve natural well-being. In recent years, however, user privacy has become an increasingly important consideration. Potential conflicts often emerge from the fact that VGI can be re-used in contexts not originally considered by volunteers. Addressing these privacy conflicts is particularly problematic in natural resource management, where visualizations are often explorative, with multifaceted and sometimes initially unknown sets of analysis outcomes. In this paper, we present an integrated and component-based approach to privacy-aware visualization of VGI, specifically suited for application to natural resource management. As a key component, HyperLogLog (HLL)—a data abstraction format—is used to allow estimation of results, instead of more accurate measurements. While HLL alone cannot preserve privacy, it can be combined with existing approaches to improve privacy while, at the same time, maintaining some flexibility of analysis. Together, these components make it possible to gradually reduce privacy risks for volunteers at various steps of the analytical process. A specific use case demonstration is provided, based on a global, publicly-available dataset that contains 100 million photos shared by 581,099 users under Creative Commons licenses. Both the data processing pipeline and resulting dataset are made available, allowing transparent benchmarking of the privacy–utility tradeoffs.</jats:p>",9,10,607,,Data processing; Spatial analysis; Natural resource management; Data science; Creative commons; Visualization; Computer science; Volunteered geographic information; Benchmarking; Social network,,,,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ijgi/ijgi9.html#DunkelLB20 https://www.scilit.net/article/1aa3cafe8eccaf28bda04e35961f2965 https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi9100607 https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/9/10/607 https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/9/10/607/pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi9100607,10.3390/ijgi9100607,3093952168,,0,003-021-285-000-620; 003-624-844-992-850; 005-457-107-035-994; 005-945-913-983-49X; 006-771-201-219-361; 011-062-030-694-246; 018-390-915-932-253; 020-126-273-086-102; 021-754-258-594-655; 023-790-999-872-908; 023-966-934-606-509; 024-575-967-323-212; 034-066-051-498-474; 034-585-669-391-948; 034-596-162-806-247; 037-702-411-463-819; 038-312-397-907-833; 039-049-636-405-912; 042-323-506-003-760; 050-504-434-540-016; 051-149-067-899-256; 054-941-787-662-255; 057-957-575-326-036; 058-289-860-749-412; 061-661-960-486-88X; 068-251-060-295-888; 071-317-042-400-119; 073-092-358-979-196; 075-055-450-711-301; 078-770-976-031-732; 086-041-698-412-913; 090-335-308-822-529; 105-632-061-338-738; 108-801-589-500-434; 109-227-276-752-73X; 118-326-632-558-678; 122-525-338-471-754; 124-942-269-062-956; 128-630-302-259-009; 134-324-227-067-470; 134-732-934-646-247; 141-054-957-497-188; 146-108-368-985-370; 163-454-449-867-390; 197-096-255-852-488,1,,(doi) 10.3390/ijgi9100607; (magid) 3093952168,en
105-213-938-893-054,W2GIS - Semantically enriching VGI in support of implicit feedback analysis,,2011,conference proceedings,Web and Wireless Geographical Information Systems,03029743; 16113349,Springer Berlin Heidelberg,Germany,Andrea Ballatore; Michela Bertolotto,"In recent years, the proliferation of Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) has enabled many Internet users to contribute to the construction of rich and increasingly complex spatial datasets. This growth of geo-referenced information and the often loose semantic structure of such data have resulted in spatial information overload. For this reason, a semantic gap has emerged between unstructured geo-spatial datasets and high-level ontological concepts. Filling this semantic gap can help reduce spatial information overload, therefore facilitating both user interactions and the analysis of such interaction. Implicit Feedback analysis is the focus of our work. In this paper we address this problem by proposing a system that executes spatial discovery queries. Our system combines a semantically-rich and spatially-poor ontology (DBpedia) with a spatially-rich and semantically-poor VGI dataset (OpenStreetMap). This technique differs from existing ones, such as the aggregated dataset LinkedGeoData, as it is focused on user interest analysis and takes map scale into account. System architecture, functionality and preliminary results gathered about the system performance are discussed.",,,78,93,Spatial analysis; Semantic Web; Information retrieval; Ontology; Computer science; Geographic information system; Scale (map); Volunteered geographic information; Semantic gap; Systems architecture,,,,,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-19173-2_8 http://researchrepository.ucd.ie/handle/10197/3350 https://researchrepository.ucd.ie/bitstream/10197/3350/1/2011%20-%20Semantically%20Enriching%20VGI%20in%20Support%20of%20Implicit%20Feedback%20Analysis%20-%20Ballatore%20Bertolotto.pdf https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1966282 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-19173-2_8 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/w2gis/w2gis2010.html#BallatoreB10 http://core.ac.uk/display/16340503 https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-19173-2_8 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/16340503.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-19173-2_8,10.1007/978-3-642-19173-2_8,1606827124,,0,000-894-184-902-194; 011-241-717-579-539; 012-623-533-849-688; 013-511-711-005-075; 013-618-362-603-877; 020-059-343-963-311; 023-561-717-824-58X; 025-930-869-630-737; 036-429-876-685-98X; 039-653-620-176-212; 040-267-517-107-219; 051-285-080-856-898; 055-082-672-588-052; 055-227-251-336-011; 057-545-918-303-995; 066-101-498-522-68X; 066-336-138-162-728; 071-403-235-661-586; 083-390-104-481-847; 083-636-093-981-383; 084-210-734-414-337; 100-589-040-309-169; 101-651-504-406-487; 102-187-989-867-096; 106-264-944-278-433; 115-958-120-977-250; 124-382-950-130-291; 128-976-006-412-740; 139-003-733-961-971; 147-017-529-889-412; 159-167-437-412-595; 167-386-676-933-304; 171-544-875-588-246; 175-711-171-861-508; 178-125-878-312-817; 180-621-485-730-676; 184-023-369-679-979; 184-038-718-938-628,34,,(doi) 10.1007/978-3-642-19173-2_8; (coreid) 16340503; (magid) 1606827124,en; en

106-305-020-563-419,Caveat Emptor: A new form of participatory mapping and its ethical implications for Participatory GIS,2019-07-10,2019,journal article,Proceedings of the ICA,25702092,Copernicus GmbH,,Koshiro Suzuki,"Abstract. Since the 1990s, the consolidation of technological platforms for geographic information has expanded the possibilities of geospatial analysis in conjunction with GIS. Even ordinary people have become capable of interactive web communication with electronic maps thanks to the emergence of smartphones compatible with GeoAPI (application programming interface) and Wi-Fi access. Many studies have described the progress that built a solid foundation of web democracy by embodying people-powered mapping circumstances in the so-called Web 2.0. However, we have yet to acquire geographic information ethics that sufficiently respond to new threats stemming from these circumstances. In the present paper, the author instantiated a user-generated online mapping website named Caveat Emptor (a.k.a. Oshimaland) to investigate the necessity of a geographic information ethics 2.0. By incorporating Suler’s (2004) concept of online disinhibition effects, the author clarified that people can utilise new technologies both in good ways and bad, from behind the safety of a mask. Despite the omnoptic mutual surveillance environment, the associated participants in actual scenes of cyberspace are not always restrained. This explains why it is necessary to update geographic information ethics to be compatible with Web 2.0 circumstances. Four types of ethical challenges were identified that are concerned with (1) the extent to which volunteered geographic information (VGI) should be recruited in constructing collective knowledge, (2) how to build a renewed geographic information ethics in general, (3) how to construct a gradation in geographic information ethics in practice, and (4) what scientific knowledge should be referred to in the contiguous areas of specialisation.",2,,1,8,Caveat emptor; Emerging technologies; Data science; Cyberspace; Participatory GIS; Computer science; Volunteered geographic information; Collective intelligence; Information ethics; Geospatial analysis,,,,,https://www.proc-int-cartogr-assoc.net/2/126/2019/ica-proc-2-126-2019.pdf https://noa.gwlb.de/receive/cop_mods_00001413 https://www.proc-int-cartogr-assoc.net/2/126/2019/,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/ica-proc-2-126-2019,10.5194/ica-proc-2-126-2019,2961525572,,0,,3,,(doi) 10.5194/ica-proc-2-126-2019; (magid) 2961525572,en

Siriba,"Over the past few years, several technology trends, notably big data analytics, volunteered geographic information, cloud computing, free and open source software, internet of things, and linked data, have emerged. This study reviews the contribution of some of these trends to Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) development, particularly in Africa. A geospatial application based on Google Container Engine, an Infrastructure as a Service cloud, has been developed. Data was sourced from the 2015 Kenya Certificate of Primary Education, the Kenya school mapping project of 2007 from the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, and Kenya's administrative boundary layers from the Independent and Electoral Boundaries Commission. By using the cloud, several operations and analyses typically common in SDIs were carried out. In addition, a cost estimate of a cloud-based Kenya National Spatial Data Infrastructure deployment is presented. Although the new technologies may not necessarily lead to wider SDI adoption, the study shows that the trends can increase the chances of SDI development and adoption, by permitting highly scalable geoservices, and facilitating cost-effective free and open source software.",6,4,189,204,Software deployment; Business; Spatial data infrastructure; Emerging technologies; Data science; Volunteered geographic information; Linked data; Big data; Cloud computing; Geospatial analysis,,,,,http://www.hrpub.org/journals/article_info.php?aid=7218,http://dx.doi.org/10.13189/cea.2018.060402,10.13189/cea.2018.060402,2889552000,,0,014-069-404-871-720; 015-986-872-059-068; 038-380-938-144-416; 043-523-938-447-077; 072-595-001-841-272; 082-291-165-855-187; 082-366-214-673-579; 092-320-597-259-20X; 094-792-785-337-138; 096-213-725-575-04X; 099-038-700-302-292; 196-262-193-426-823,1,,(magid) 2889552000; (doi) 10.13189/cea.2018.060402,en

In this paper, OSM road data have been analyzed with the aim of characterizing the behavior of OSM contributors. The study area, Ankara, the capital city of Turkey, was evaluated with several network analysis methods, such as completeness, degree of centrality, betweenness, closeness, PageRank, and a proposed method measuring the activation of contributors in a bounded area from 2007–2017. An evaluation of the results was also discussed in this paper by taking into account the following indicators for each year: number of nodes, ways, contributors, mean lengths, and sinuosity values of roads. The results show that the experience levels of the contributors determine the contribution type.

Remote sensing techniques have eased land use/cover mapping substantially by observing the earth remotely through diminishing field surveying and in-site data collection. However, field measurement is still required to identify training sites for defining the existing land use classes, which requires visiting the study area. This paper is intended to utilize volunteered geographic information (VGI) contributions to the OpenStreetMap (OSM) project as an alternative data source instead of gathering training sites through insite visits and to evaluate how accurate land use patterns can be mapped. High resolution imagery of RapidEye with 5 meter spatial resolution is selected to derive land use patterns of Koblenz, Germany through a maximum likelihood classification technique. The achieved land use map is compared with the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security Urban Atlas (GMESUA) and a Kappa Index of 89% is achieved. The outcomes prove that VGI can be integrated within remote sensing processes to facilitate the process of earth observation and monitoring.;                     </jats:p>",XL-4/W1,1,51,55,Data collection; Geography; Data source; Land use mapping; Urban landscape; High resolution; Earth observation; Land use; Volunteered geographic information; Cartography,,,,,https://noa.gwlb.de/receive/cop_mods_00022775 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ISPAr.XL4a..51J/abstract http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/md/chemgeo/geog/lehrstuehle/gis/jokar_land_use_mapping.pdf http://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/XL-4-W1/51/2013/isprsarchives-XL-4-W1-51-2013.pdf http://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/XL-4-W1/51/2013/ https://www.geog.uni-heidelberg.de/md/chemgeo/geog/lehrstuehle/gis/jokar_land_use_mapping.pdf https://doaj.org/article/bbc6b8d762f34bc088c0dc761b7472a0,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/isprsarchives-xl-4-w1-51-2013,10.5194/isprsarchives-xl-4-w1-51-2013,2033822369,,0,008-714-358-699-609; 011-247-309-044-225; 028-739-825-417-25X; 040-308-597-328-326; 057-545-918-303-995; 075-401-942-286-419; 085-639-703-897-047; 133-439-587-267-381; 142-299-995-042-864; 143-129-439-621-528; 152-746-352-995-244,15,,(doi) 10.5194/isprsarchives-xl-4-w1-51-2013; (coreid) 91744100; (magid) 2033822369,en

First, it focuses on those characteristics of VGI projects that present different goals and modes of organization, while using a crowdsourcing strategy to manage participants and contributions. Next, a tool is developed in order to design the central crowdsourced processing unit that is best suited for a specific project definition, associating it with a trend towards crowd-based or community-driven approaches. The design is structured around the characterization of different ways of participating, and the task cognitive demand of working on geo-information management, spatial problem solving and ideation, or knowledge acquisition. Then, the crowdsourcing process design helps to identify what kind of participants are needed and outline subsequent engagement strategies. This is based on an analysis of differences among volunteers? participatory behaviors and the associated set of factors motivating them to contribute, whether on a crowd or community-sourced basis. From a VGI system perspective, this paper presents a set of guidelines and methodological steps in order to align project goals, processes and volunteers and thus successfully attract participation.

Chao; Andrew T. Torelli; Alexis D. Ostrowski,"Abstract Non-expert scientists are frequently involved in research requiring data acquisition over large geographic areas. Despite mutual benefits for such ""citizen science"", barriers also exist, including 1) difficulty maintaining user engagement with timely feedback, and 2) the challenge of providing non-experts with the means to generate reliable data. We have developed a system that addresses these barriers. Our technologies, KnoWare and InSpector, allow users to: collect reliable scientific measurements, map geo-tagged data, and intuitively visualize the results in real-time. KnoWare comprises a web portal and an iOS app with two core functions. First, users can generate scientific 'queries' that entail a call for information posed to a crowd with customized options for participant responses and viewing data. Second, users can respond to queries with their GPS-enabled mobile device, which results in their geo- and time-stamped responses populating a web-accessible map in real time. KnoWare can also interface with additional applications to diversify the types of data that can be reported. We demonstrate this capability with a second iOS app called InSpector that performs quantitative water quality measurements. When used in combination, these technologies create a workflow to facilitate the collection, sharing and interpretation of scientific data by non-expert scientists. Keywords: Citizen Science, Cell-phone Spectrometer, Water Contaminant Analysis, Web and Mobile Development, Visualization Introduction The prevalence of smartphones represents an opportunity to gather, create, and consume data from individuals on a scale that has not previously been available. Even the 'average' mobile devices in widespread use have significant computing power and are typically GPS-enabled. Scientific research that requires widespread sampling over geographic areas can benefit greatly by mobilizing members of the population equipped with these devices to conduct scientifically useful measurements or activities. Data generated in this way can complement existing data collection methods. One key advantage of these 'citizen science' initiatives is that sourcing large groups of individuals is an efficient strategy to collect large-scale data sets because contributors typically volunteer their time in exchange for meaningful participation. However, in spite of the benefits, multiple barriers work against increased prevalence of citizen science initiatives, including 1) the difficulty maintaining prolonged user engagement with meaningful feedback, and 2) the challenge of providing non-experts with the means to collect reliable data. We have developed technologies to directly address these barriers by providing 'citizen scientists' with 1) an easy-to-use mechanism to participate in scientific investigations with real time visual feedback, and 2) software and a device that interface with iPhones to collect reliable scientific measurements from color-based test kits in widespread use. Our technologies currently focus on allowing users to record water quality measurements since such data collection requires large, repeated measurement, and there are many existing citizen science initiatives already focused on water quality that may benefit. Our technology platform, called KnoWare, comprises a paired web portal and iOS application for data visualization and mapping. In this report, we use KnoWare in combination with an additional iOS application we created (InSpector) to process images taken with the iPhone camera using an add-on device. The InSpector app allows users to obtain reliable readings of colorimetric water quality tests that currently depend on subjective color-comparisons. These technologies work together to provide an engaging workflow for the collection and interpretation of environmental water quality data by non-professional, citizen scientists. Literature Review The technologies we have developed facilitate citizen science based data collection efforts with the following motivations: increasing exposure and 'literacy' in STEM areas, the potential impact of involving the broader public in scientific efforts to advance research, and opportunities to engage students at our own institution in the development of software and devices with 'real-world' applications. …",19,,125,139,Data collection; World Wide Web; Data visualization; Workflow; Mobile device; Citizen science; Data quality; Population; Visualization; Computer science,,,,,https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-485809220/knoware-a-system-for-citizen-based-environmental https://core.ac.uk/display/43993884 https://www.informingscience.org/Publications/3500,http://dx.doi.org/10.28945/3500,10.28945/3500,2607142488,,0,,3,,(magid) 2607142488; (doi) 10.28945/3500,en

Rampazzo,"<jats:p>Abstract. For the first time in the Mediterranean Sea various temperature sampling strategies are studied and compared to each other by means of the Observing System Simulation Experiment technique. Their usefulness in the framework of the Mediterranean Forecasting System (MFS) is assessed by quantifying their impact in a Mediterranean General Circulation Model in numerical twin experiments via univariate data assimilation of temperature profiles in summer and winter conditions. Data assimilation is performed by means of the optimal interpolation algorithm implemented in the SOFA (System for Ocean Forecasting and Analysis) code. The sampling strategies studied here include various combinations of eXpendable BathyThermograph (XBT) profiles collected along Volunteer Observing Ship (VOS) tracks, Airborne XBTs (AXBTs) and sea surface temperatures. The actual sampling strategy adopted in the MFS Pilot Project during the Targeted Operational Period (TOP, winter-spring 2000) is also studied. The data impact is quantified by the error reduction relative to the free run. The most effective sampling strategies determine 25–40% error reduction, depending on the season, the geographic area and the depth range. A qualitative relationship can be recognized in terms of the spread of information from the data positions, between basin circulation features and spatial patterns of the error reduction fields, as a function of different spatial and seasonal characteristics of the dynamics. The largest error reductions are observed when samplings are characterized by extensive spatial coverages, as in the cases of AXBTs and the combination of XBTs and surface temperatures. The sampling strategy adopted during the TOP is characterized by little impact, as a consequence of a sampling frequency that is too low. Key words.

The goal of this research was to engage members of a local food community and generate volunteered geographic information (VGI) on community food assets. During active data collection, over 200 food assets were reported. This paper details the systematic approach used to create VGI, which emphasizes the socio-cultural context surrounding the mapping technology. The project began with an identified need to connect to and learn from the local food community. The participants were drawn from active food system stakeholders, and a Geoweb infrastructure was selected based on publicly available crowdsourcing tools. The resulting VGI is presented according to system functions: input (Web traffic, contributors, input types), management (contribution vetting, privacy), analysis (typology of input), and presentation (sharing the submitted data).

The importance of remote-sensing (RS), Geographic Information System (GIS) and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data is stressed by comparing studies of the use of these technologies for natural disaster management. Spatial data sharing is discussed in the context of the establishment of Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDIs) for natural disasters. Some examples of SDI application in disaster management are analyzed, and the need for participation from organizations and governments to facilitate the exchange of information and to improve preventive and emergency plans is reinforced. Additionally, the potential involvement of citizens in the risk and disaster management process by providing voluntary data collected from volunteered geographic information (VGI) applications is explored.

111-878-007-047-603,Analysing and predicting micro-location patterns of software firms,2017-12-24,2017,journal article,ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information,22209964,MDPI AG,Switzerland,Jan Kinne; Bernd Resch,"While the effects of non-geographic aggregation on inference are well studied in economics, research; on geographic aggregation is rather scarce. This knowledge gap together with the use of aggregated; spatial units in previous firm location studies result in a lack of understanding of firm location determinants at the microgeographic level. Suitable data for microgeographic location analysis has become available only recently through the emergence of Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI), especially the OpenStreetMap (OSM) project, and the increasing availability of official (open) geodata. In this paper, we use a comprehensive dataset of three million street-level geocoded firm observations to explore the location pattern of software firms in an Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA). Based on the ESDA results, we develop a software firm location prediction model using Poisson regression and OSM data. Our findings demonstrate that the model yields plausible predictions and OSM data is suitable for microgeographic location analysis. Our results; also show that non-aggregated data can be used to detect information on location determinants, which are superimposed when aggregated spatial units are analysed, and that some findings of previous firm location studies are not robust at the microgeographic level. However, we also conclude that the lack of high-resolution geodata on socio-economic population characteristics causes systematic prediction errors, especially in cities with diverse and segregated populations.",7,1,1,,Spatial analysis; Inference; Software; Population; Location pattern; Computer science; Geocoding; Volunteered geographic information; Cartography; Poisson regression,,,,,https://ub-madoc.bib.uni-mannheim.de/43818/ https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ijgi/ijgi7.html#KinneR18 https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/7/1/1 https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/7/1/1/pdf https://madoc.bib.uni-mannheim.de/43818/ http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017IJGI....7....1K/abstract https://core.ac.uk/display/145075346 https://madoc-dev.bib.uni-mannheim.de/43818,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi7010001,10.3390/ijgi7010001,2777813969,,0,003-661-327-898-826; 005-320-166-884-008; 008-655-662-451-459; 012-197-653-867-97X; 013-445-037-365-411; 016-266-310-505-290; 017-316-052-698-091; 018-320-455-212-605; 019-381-883-497-681; 020-150-578-869-108; 021-682-525-378-640; 022-206-122-380-163; 022-473-450-579-960; 022-906-242-934-551; 023-622-019-380-658; 024-649-671-146-017; 025-878-090-138-065; 031-484-984-530-205; 038-976-596-179-447; 039-350-845-801-666; 040-267-517-107-219; 041-657-052-637-278; 046-677-705-106-74X; 050-325-231-056-917; 054-708-882-205-377; 057-545-918-303-995; 059-386-373-883-199; 060-647-324-148-217; 061-054-982-995-277; 062-207-347-729-560; 062-538-590-179-278; 066-153-268-165-730; 066-988-074-809-599; 070-670-406-630-355; 072-746-409-706-782; 075-248-101-405-542; 082-366-214-673-579; 082-865-928-834-65X; 084-726-506-340-548; 086-590-483-751-717; 086-758-442-428-039; 088-339-711-439-200; 088-665-707-744-409; 092-334-512-538-62X; 096-563-575-417-117; 099-425-157-673-55X; 111-766-195-733-03X; 112-337-891-945-483; 112-559-888-617-247; 113-707-542-858-623; 119-001-190-925-258; 127-342-474-919-111; 131-963-234-999-956; 147-213-981-170-541; 150-860-205-570-808; 155-272-375-674-504; 155-401-767-257-978; 159-526-981-032-686; 160-532-151-807-987; 161-159-404-186-335; 162-807-529-743-974; 166-051-249-889-942; 171-544-875-588-246; 180-588-827-456-039; 187-456-696-317-732; 195-730-464-255-324,30,,(doi) 10.3390/ijgi7010001; (magid) 2777813969; (coreid) 145075346,en
112-537-645-005-580,The NIEHS responds to Hurricane Katrina.,,2005,journal article,Environmental health perspectives,00916765; 15529924,"Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services",United States,David A. Schwartz,"I am very proud of the role that the NIEHS has played in the Hurricane Katrina relief efforts. Extramural and intramural scientists have jointly developed and are implementing both short-term and long-term responses to this natural disaster. Many individuals have contributed to our response, but I especially want to acknowledge the leadership of Sam Wilson, Rich Freed, Bill Suk, Allen Dearry, Mary Wolfe, and Angie Sanders. These six people have played a critical role in responding to the devastation and hardship that was caused by Hurricane Katrina. While these people deserve special recognition, I am overwhelmed by the outpouring of support, encouragement, and volunteerism from many other members of our institute.; ; Here at home, Bill Suk continues to lead an effort to develop an NIEHS website that will utilize geographic information system (GIS) mapping to help identify the environmental hazards from Katrina that may affect the health of those living in or returning to the Gulf region. This website will be continuously updated through a collaboration established between the NIEHS and the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), super-computing center. Mark Ellisman at UCSD and Marie Lynn Miranda at Duke University have played key roles in developing this website. We anticipate that the website will serve as a national resource to track environmental hazards and focus various medical and environmental responses in areas that are in greatest need. Included on this website is up-to-date information on safety and hazardous waste cleanup training for the thousands of workers involved in the cleanup and recovery activities in the region, as well as a compendium of environmental health resources for medical responders.; ; Allen Dearry has established a consultative service to address environmental hazards that may have an impact on human health. This consultative service, available through the Katrina website, is linked to experts in our intramural and extramural research programs who have provided informed responses to specific environmental health concerns of residents, healthcare providers, and workers involved in the rescue and recovery efforts.; ; We have established a cooperative relationship with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to assist them in the deployment of public health teams to areas that are in need of food, shelter, and a safe water supply. Mary Wolfe has taken a leadership role in this effort and is working directly with Tom Sinks of the CDC to provide expertise from the NIEHS to support the CDC in more effectively responding to the emerging public health needs.; ; The NIH deployed a team to the Gulf region to provide direct medical care to the victims of Hurricane Katrina. The NIEHS played a major role in this effort, and established a North Carolina contingent that consisted of physicians, nurses, and other health care providers from both the NIEHS and Duke University. Sam Wilson and Rich Freed coordinated activities between North Carolina and the central headquarters at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). I was fortunate to be one of the members of the team that traveled to Meridian, Mississippi, and established a 500-bed medical facility there including a triage area, ambulatory care area, acute care component, and an area for hospitalized patients.; ; Unfortunately, many of those affected by Katrina were reluctant to leave their homes for medical care despite the extensive amount of local destruction. Consequently, individuals in our group made several trips to the Gulfport coastal region, an area most severely affected by the hurricane, to assess the extent of medical need and to determine whether we could safely establish a medical facility in that region. As all of you know, the extent of destruction was overwhelming, with cars upturned, tractor trailers scattered like matchsticks, homes completely leveled, buildings destroyed, and rotting food scattered throughout the area; the Gulf Coast was nothing short of what one would expect in a war zone.; ; An accelerated environmental health research plan is vital to protecting vulnerable populations during present and future catastrophes.; ; Despite this, we found that the medical infrastructure was relatively intact. Patients were being seen effectively in clinics, and hospitals were open with sufficient bed capacity. We visited at least six different communities in the Gulfport region, and were sufficiently convinced that our team of health care providers was simply not needed. Thus, we decided to suspend the NIH medical mission, although we remain on call if other needs are identified. I was impressed with the cooperative and constructive relationship that was established between the NIH, Duke University, and the Public Health Service. Moreover, other universities, including the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, are providing additional support to the region.; ; Hurricane Katrina has made it abundantly clear that there is an unmet need for a national coordinated response plan to assess environmental and biological exposures to hazardous agents, to understand the relationship of exposures to adverse health outcomes through appropriate surveillance, and to develop early prevention and intervention strategies designed to identify at-risk individuals and reduce morbidity and mortality. To address this need, the NIEHS is working with the CDC and the EPA to develop a proposal to prevent adverse health consequences related to environmental conditions and exposures in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, and to establish the scientific expertise and infrastructure in environmental health needed to address both immediate and future preventive health care needs and the response capacity following man-made and natural disasters. We believe that an accelerated environmental health research plan is vital to protecting vulnerable populations during present and future catastrophes.; ; In tough times, the strengths and weaknesses of an institute become apparent. I’m proud to say that in the time since Hurricane Katrina struck, the NIEHS has proven to be an exceedingly strong institution with vitality, resolve, and a deep sense of dedication to relieving human suffering. I’m sincerely proud to be a member of the NIEHS, and I am confident that our team is fully capable of addressing the unforeseen challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.",113,11,A722,,Public health; Health care; Natural disaster; Occupational safety and health; Acute care; Relief Work; Poison control; Public relations; Suicide prevention; Medicine; Gerontology,,Disasters; Environmental Health; National Institutes of Health (U.S.); Relief Work; Southeastern United States; United States; Universities,,,https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC1310935/ https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/ehp.113-a722 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1310935/ https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-140014397/the-niehs-responds-to-hurricane-katrina,http://dx.doi.org/10.1289/ehp.113-a722,10.1289/ehp.113-a722,1979061459,PMC1310935,0,,5,,(doi) 10.1289/ehp.113-a722; (pmcid) pmc1310935; (pmid) 16263489; (magid) 1979061459,en

Remote sensing frameworks have been proven to give accurate results in case of major events; nonetheless, also medium and micro oil spills have their own importance, especially in protected areas that deserve special attention. In this paper, we propose a monitoring framework based on the collection of in situ observations and on their integration with remote sensing in order to fill out existing observational gaps. In particular, besides the data collected by special monitoring devices, in situ observations include volunteered geographical information as an additional source of valuable data. Oil spill sights, notified by volunteers through a specially-designed app, are integrated in the monitoring system and therein processed together with remote sensing data in order to proactively detect anomalous events and produce alerts. Field operational tests in two areas demonstrate the technical validity of the approach, while users’ reception testifies to its potential in raising people’s awareness on marine pollution.</jats:p>",8,10,1743,,Environmental resource management; Environmental science; Volunteered geographic information,,,,Seventh Framework Programme,http://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/8/10/1743/pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app8101743,10.3390/app8101743,2893711943,,0,000-965-376-485-343; 005-996-427-454-47X; 006-655-853-373-649; 013-803-494-618-557; 019-651-691-730-191; 021-989-960-357-701; 034-121-881-390-322; 040-184-564-272-635; 041-908-681-930-067; 043-030-740-321-289; 047-100-212-874-054; 055-285-190-207-595; 061-310-624-875-208; 065-887-942-404-702; 072-243-912-426-29X; 074-138-498-043-864; 078-505-951-172-945; 080-029-258-075-925; 101-358-130-388-487; 101-557-228-907-056; 114-501-291-300-416; 115-495-205-587-616; 116-740-976-449-150; 125-419-063-912-951; 129-014-047-681-575; 134-254-251-551-077; 143-105-889-683-762,3,,(doi) 10.3390/app8101743; (magid) 2893711943,en

Geographical information science is no exception. In this article, we investigate the possibilities for deployment of e-infrastructures to inform spatial planning, analysis and policy-making. We describe an existing architecture that feeds both static and dynamic simulation models from a variety of sources, including not only administrative datasets but also attitudes and behaviours which are harvested online from crowds. This infrastructure also supports visualisation and computationally intensive processing. The main aim of this article is to illustrate how spatial simulation models can be calibrated with crowd-sourced data. We introduce an example in which popular attitudes to congestion charging in a major UK city (Manchester) were collected, with promotional support from a high-profile media organisation (the BBC). These data are used to estimate the parameters of a transport simulation model, using a hungry estimation procedure which is deployed within a high-performance computational grid. We indicate how the resulting model might be used to evaluate the impact of alternative policy options for regulating the traffic in Manchester. Whilst the procedure is novel in itself, we argue that greater credibility could be added by the incorporation of open-source simulation models and by the use of social networking mechanisms to share policy evaluations much more widely.",25,8,1221,1239,Simulation modeling; Information technology; Grid; Spatial planning; Crowds; e-social science; Credibility; Computer science; Geographic information system; Operations research,,,,,http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/76812/ https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/gis/gis25.html#BirkinMHGM11 http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13658816.2011.559169 https://doi.org/10.1080/13658816.2011.559169 https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13658816.2011.559169 https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1330291/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13658816.2011.559169,10.1080/13658816.2011.559169,2003262531,,0,006-186-149-903-379; 012-124-370-266-827; 017-570-187-910-196; 020-794-762-538-716; 021-477-956-672-339; 033-343-591-149-861; 040-362-140-259-268; 043-779-241-393-741; 045-009-986-444-04X; 045-057-072-579-059; 053-238-194-541-940; 057-545-918-303-995; 070-855-543-985-225; 072-383-012-867-983; 076-238-525-473-968; 087-089-378-820-781; 087-147-392-716-844; 098-221-071-931-780; 109-812-455-158-514; 114-645-119-877-670; 119-274-818-086-853; 135-115-902-794-520; 135-395-915-852-098; 147-608-018-160-544; 166-079-879-705-997; 167-316-020-723-124; 186-123-783-899-708,8,,(magid) 2003262531; (doi) 10.1080/13658816.2011.559169,en

In our earlier work, we worked on the extraction of the road network using a multi-agent approach guided by Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI). The limitation of this VGI-only approach is its inability to update the new road developments as it only follows the VGI. In this work, we employ a deep learning approach to update the road network to include new road developments not captured by the existing VGI. The output of the first stage is used to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in the second stage to generate a general model to classify road pixels. Post-processing is used to correct the undesired artifacts such as buildings, vegetation, occlusions, etc. to generate a final road map. Our proposed method is tested on the satellite images acquired over Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates and the aerial images acquired over Massachusetts, United States of America, and is observed to produce accurate results.</jats:p>",11,9,1012,,Deep learning; Machine learning; Artificial intelligence; Road networks; Computer science; Volunteered geographic information,,,,,http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019RemS...11.1012M/abstract https://doi.org/10.3390/rs11091012 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/remotesensing/remotesensing11.html#ManandharMAM19,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs11091012,10.3390/rs11091012,2942939191,,0,001-198-155-554-327; 005-969-987-069-138; 009-726-398-715-794; 013-891-806-973-199; 015-582-718-510-067; 020-929-508-261-569; 026-569-624-461-279; 033-302-408-119-744; 039-970-463-405-198; 044-233-408-864-739; 059-149-073-001-124; 060-154-084-298-877; 062-200-522-041-252; 064-704-230-329-74X; 075-505-206-339-830; 085-852-773-045-002; 090-101-617-824-657; 098-558-083-679-870; 126-260-701-486-243; 126-619-716-815-554; 127-401-616-397-580; 140-970-933-066-399; 142-557-644-317-44X; 158-023-636-314-964; 161-459-023-831-470; 180-085-927-404-522; 187-152-078-539-765,5,,(doi) 10.3390/rs11091012; (magid) 2942939191,en

K. Dhonju; Wen Xiao; B Shakya; Jon Mills; null Sarhosis,"Abstract. Heritage documentation has become increasingly urgent due to both natural impacts and human influences. The documentation of countless heritage sites around the globe is a massive project that requires significant amounts of financial and labour resources. With the concepts of volunteered geographic information (VGI) and citizen science, heritage data such as digital photographs can be collected through online crowd participation. Whilst photographs are not strictly geographic data, they can be geo-tagged by the participants. They can also be automatically geo-referenced into a global coordinate system if collected via mobile phones which are now ubiquitous. With the assistance of web-mapping, an online geo-crowdsourcing platform has been developed to collect and display heritage structure photographs. Details of platform development are presented in this paper. The prototype is demonstrated with several heritage examples.

They created multi-million dollar businesses in a very short time by providing novel ways to explore data geographically. We use the term “Virtual Globes” as the common denominator for technologies offering capabilities to annotate, edit and publish geographic information to a world-wide audience and to visualize information provided by the public and private sectors, as well as by citizens who volunteer new data. Unfortunately, but not surprising for a new trend or paradigm, overlapping terms such as “Virtual Globes”, “Digital Earth”, “Geospatial Web”, “Geoportal” or software specific terms are used heterogeneously. We analyze the terminologies and trends in scientific publications and ask whether these developments serve science and society. While usage can be answered quantitatively, the authors reason from the literature studied that these developments serve to educate the masses and may help to democratize geographic information by extending the producer base. We believe that we can contribute to a better distinction between software centered terms and the generic concept as such.

In this review paper we give an overview of gamification, and user motivations for playing games, and we discuss basic game design elements. We also compare existing services, like Foursquare, Waze and Ingress that use game design elements in geographic data collection processes. Services are compared in the context of the SAPS model and actual used game mechanics, including points, levels, leaderboards, badges and challenges. Gamification can be applied to geographic data collection processes as shown by the services analysed in this article.

Faust; Elizabeth Will; Millie S. Williams,"Graduate students received training in total crop management (TCM) techniques including pest scouting and trapping, nutritional monitoring, and graphical tracking of crop height. In 1995, one student visited five greenhouse businesses biweekly during the poinsettia (Euphorbia pulcherrima Willd.) season to provide TCM training to one greenhouse employee per business. In 1996, a second student visited one greenhouse business every week during the poinsettia crop to conduct the TCM program for that business. The students benefited from the gained practical knowledge of greenhouse production techniques and TCM techniques, and they also benefited from the opportunity to visit commercial greenhouses and interact with staff throughout the production cycle for an entire crop. This program also provided the students with the opportunity to develop their teaching, communication and training skills. The participating growers benefited during this study from receiving useful production information and TCM training. An evaluation of the program conducted in 1998 indicated that four of the five participating businesses continue to use some TCM techniques, while two of the five have fully integrated the TCM program into their normal production routines. Service learning can be defined as a method 1) under which students learn and develop skills through active participation in organized experiences that meet actual community or industry needs and that are coordinated in collaboration with the school, 2) that provides students with opportunities to use newly acquired skills and knowledge in real-life situations, and 3) that enhances what is taught in school by extending student learning beyond the classroom and into the community (Moon, 1994). The benefits of service learning include positive impacts on students’ attitudes, values and skills (Eyler et al., 1997), while Osborne et al. (1998) demonstrated that service-learning students became more confident of their ability to work with others and experienced an increase in their perceived social competency. While many of the service learning programs being developed at universities focus on community service and volunteerism, strategic alliances between universities, students and industries provide opportunities for rich educational field experiences in discipline-specific areas of study (Lenk, 1997). Within the field of horticulture, perhaps the most commonly used service approach to learning involves undergraduate landscape design courses, wherein students create designs for the surrounding community or members of the community (Davis, 1999). While traditional graduate degree programs focus on research activities, service learning programs can provide horticulture graduate students exposure to extension training and possible extension career opportunities. So, we developed a program to allow graduate students to work closely with commercial greenhouse businesses and the extension floriculture specialist. The program involved the graduate students training commercial greenhouse employees in the proper implementation of a total crop management (TCM) program at their business site. TCM refers to the integration of integrated pest management techniques for pest and disease control (Powell and Lindquist, 1992), nutritional monitoring (Warncke and Krauskopf, 1983), and graphical tracking of crop height (Heins and Carlson, 1990). TCM techniques are tools to assist growers in the decision-making process throughout the duration of the crop (Sanderson and Gill, 1998). Proper implementation of TCM procedures allow growers to recognize and respond to potential production problems in advance of the problem causing substantial economic losses. Thus, the TCM program served as a tool to integrate graduate student training and extension education. The objectives of this project were 1) to provide graduate students with a practical industry experience through a servicelearning program, 2) to train commercial greenhouse staff in the proper implementation of TCM techniques, 3) to record the impact of this training program on the participating businesses production methods, and 4) to determine the potential opportunity for greenhouse businesses within a specific geographical region to hire a professional scout or crop advisor to provide production and management assistance.",10,2,378,380,Landscape design; Business; Social competence; Service-learning; Crop management; Community or; Ability to work; Active participation; Greenhouse; Medical education,,,,,http://horttech.ashspublications.org/content/10/2/378.abstract https://journals.ashs.org/view/journals/horttech/10/2/article-p378.xml http://horttech.ashspublications.org/content/10/2/378.full.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.21273/horttech.10.2.378,10.21273/horttech.10.2.378,2187034760,,0,048-857-954-868-228; 096-162-048-275-180; 096-679-938-776-544; 098-952-326-026-600; 132-182-680-405-139; 133-890-646-506-116,1,,(doi) 10.21273/horttech.10.2.378; (magid) 2187034760,en

In this study, we evaluate the completeness of the road network in the VGI data set OpenStreetMap (OSM). The evaluation is based on an accurate and efficient network-matching algorithm. The study begins with a comparison of the two main strategies for network matching: segment-based and node-based matching. The comparison shows that the result quality is comparable for the two strategies, but the node-based result is considerably more computationally efficient. Therefore, we improve the accuracy of node-based algorithm by handling topological relationships and detecting patterns of complicated network components. Finally, we conduct a case study on the extended node-based algorithm in which we match OSM to the Swedish National Road Database (NVDB) in Scania, Sweden.

Obwanda; Alice Muga; Thomas Matete; Paul Kisia,"Access to quality essential healthcare services and vaccines for all is key to achieving universal health coverage. Inequities driven by differences in place of residence and socio-economic status persist among different communities hindering the achievement of sustained performance on immunization indicators. Innovative community-based Reach Every Child (REC) interventions at the sub-county and county level can reduce these local inequities. This study determines the effect of an enhanced door-to-door immunization strategy on improving immunization coverage in hard-to-reach areas of Migori. This was a cross-sectional review of District Health Information System 2 immunization data for July and August 2018 for Migori County. During the presidential immunization rapid results initiative (RRI) in July 2018, poorly performing wards/facilities were mapped using the Quantum Geographic Information Systems methodology, and unreached rural-urban populations identified. Through review of facility level Kenya Expanded Programme on Immunization data, 64 health facilities with over 100 unimmunized children each between January 2017 and June 2018 in all sub-counties were prioritized. In August 2018, intensified fixed-point immunization services were offered within the prioritized facilities. Further, a 3-day door-to-door defaulter tracing by community health volunteers and household level immunization by nurses was conducted. Immunization coverage performance for access and utilization for the two periods were compared using z-tests/t-tests. Cumulatively, a total of 10,744 and 14,809 children were reached with immunization in July and August respectively for the 64 facilities. There were significant increases in the immunization coverage for BCG (74.4% vs 89.9%, P = 0.0001), Penta 1(96.2% vs 102%, P = 0.0649), Penta 3 (92.3% vs 112.1%, P = 0.0001), MR1 (81.7% vs 111.5%, P < 0.0001) and the fully immunized children at 1 year (78.6% vs 103.9%, P < 0.0001). Penta 3 and MR1 drop-out rates (3.99% vs − 9.86%, P = 0.0007; 15.06% vs − 9.27%, P = 0.0001 respectively) decreased significantly. Similar significant effects were observed at the subcounty levels (P < 0.05). Hard-to-reach populations require multiple REC strategies to reach every child with immunization. Health facilities should actively analyze and use routine immunization data and invest in community health strengthening systems to identify hard-to-reach areas to be targeted with outreaches to improve immunization coverage.",19,1,1,11,Epidemiology; Public health; Biostatistics; Health informatics; Health care; Psychological intervention; Community health; Residence; Medicine; Environmental health,Access and utilization; Hard – to – reach; Immunization; Immunization coverage,Cross-Sectional Studies; Health Services Accessibility/statistics & numerical data; Humans; Immunization Programs/methods; Infant; Kenya; Program Evaluation; Vaccination Coverage/statistics & numerical data; Vaccines/administration & dosage,Vaccines,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12889-019-7415-8 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31391028 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6686480 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s12889-019-7415-8.pdf https://europepmc.org/article/MED/31391028 https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-019-7415-8 https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12889-019-7415-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12889-019-7415-8,10.1186/s12889-019-7415-8,2965614360,PMC6686480,0,001-840-543-437-128; 002-625-661-217-569; 004-966-043-450-062; 006-259-202-944-116; 007-523-579-554-173; 007-966-938-657-194; 011-369-630-688-700; 016-740-224-164-472; 018-290-519-722-440; 018-776-712-516-534; 020-957-309-536-564; 025-506-158-935-937; 028-005-478-598-822; 032-330-702-098-624; 034-998-380-546-457; 037-805-322-548-417; 040-398-050-849-699; 050-345-391-087-817; 058-031-292-831-013; 068-968-384-496-65X; 069-636-151-061-554; 085-939-249-977-569; 105-380-630-332-718; 105-500-881-127-368; 107-085-923-840-063; 116-794-334-375-907; 119-697-131-311-000; 127-639-196-224-965; 131-912-287-256-195; 158-019-705-165-316; 173-741-421-698-585,4,,(magid) 2965614360; (pmcid) pmc6686480; (pmid) 31391028; (doi) 10.1186/s12889-019-7415-8; (pii) 10.1186/s12889-019-7415-8,en

In particular, consideration is given to what makes each information source valuable to the user, and how this can be used to help developers of GIS provide more useful, usable and satisfying products. The assumption that VGI is inferior to PGI is shown to be unfounded; rather each has its own strengths in describing particular aspects of the user information landscape. Considering the opportunities to influence user activities, both VGI and PGI have a greater ability to influence the user in the planning phase than actually during the activity.

Wilson,"The general convergence of location with digital information communication technologies (ICTs) has brought about profound shifts in the content, forms, and practices that surround spatial media. In geography, these phenomena have been variously and alternately referred to as ‘volunteered geographic information’ (VGI) (Elwood et al. 2011; Goodchild 2007), ‘neogeography’ (Graham 2010; Turner 2006; Warf and Sui 2010; Wilson and Graham 2013a, 2013b), ‘(new) spatial media’ (Crampton 2009; Elwood and Leszczynski 2012), and ‘the geoweb,’ (Elwood and Leszczynski 2011; Haklay et al. 2008; Scharl and Tochtermann 2007). Here, we prefigure ‘the geoweb’ as we consider it to account for both new materialities and new practices. Regardless of the neologism used to refer to these phenomena, they nevertheless present significant challenges to our disciplinary thinking about geographic information and technologies. Much of our early engagements of the geoweb have been informed by the GIScience and Critical GIS traditions, which are ontologically and epistemologically committed to data regimes, practices, and technics associated with geographic information systems (GIS) as a singular or unique technological assemblage (for examples see Farman 2010; Guptill 2007; Miller 2006; Sui and Goodchild 2011; Sui 2008; Wilson 2009). More recently, however, geographers have acknowledged that the rapid proliferation and diversification of spatial media, content forms, and praxes require new empirical, conceptual, and theoretical approaches to apprehend both the nature and implications of these transitions and materialities. This need for new approaches has been most saliently articulated in a 2008 special issue of GeoJournal devoted to VGI edited by Sarah Elwood (volume 72 issues 3–4) (Elwood 2008b). Contributors to this special issue highlighted the imperatives of reconceptualizing entrenched notions of ‘the user’ (Budhathoki et al. 2008); attending to the altered contexts of information curation (Flanagin and Metzger 2008); evaluating the effectiveness and appropriateness of existing frameworks—such as Feminist, Critical, and Participatory GIS—for ‘reading’ or engaging the geoweb (Elwood 2008a; Tulloch 2008); and, devising new metrics and/ or schemes for evaluating the validity and reliability of user-generated geographic information (Bishr and Mantelas 2008; Mummidi and Krumm 2008).

The system enables users to define to what extent they would like the route to have green areas (e.g., parks, squares, trees), social places (e.g., cafes, restaurants, shops) and quieter streets (i.e., with less road traffic). We present how the greenness, sociability, and quietness factors are defined and extracted from OSM as well as how they are integrated into a routing cost function. We intrinsically evaluate customized routes from one-thousand trips, i.e., origin⁻destination pairs, and observe that these are, in general, as we intended-slightly longer but significantly more social, greener, and quieter than the respective shortest routes. Based on a survey taken by 156 individuals, we also evaluate the system's usefulness, usability, controlability, and transparency. The majority of the survey participants agree that the system is useful and easy to use and that it gives them the feeling of being in control regarding the extraction of routes in accordance with their greenness, sociability, and quietness preferences. The survey also provides valuable insights into users requirements and wishes regarding a tool for interactively generating customized pedestrian routes.",18,11,3794,,TRIPS architecture; Usability; Transport engineering; Pedestrian; Road traffic; Computer science; Volunteered geographic information; Transparency (graphic),human–computer interaction; pedestrian routing; volunteered geographic information,"Accidents, Traffic/psychology; Adult; Female; Geographic Information Systems; Humans; Male; Pedestrians/psychology; Safety; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (276698709),https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Adspace.library.uu.nl%3A1874%2F381258 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30404175 http://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/381258 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/sensors/sensors18.html#NovackWZ18 https://doi.org/10.3390/s18113794 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30404175/,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s18113794,10.3390/s18113794,2900433568,PMC6263876,0,000-267-877-384-745; 003-135-776-578-588; 003-975-387-115-514; 005-168-230-810-780; 006-107-366-016-938; 007-107-164-094-715; 009-865-289-236-196; 011-468-625-948-153; 018-122-122-703-871; 027-922-261-378-855; 028-089-684-426-82X; 030-463-136-139-837; 030-747-337-025-208; 032-399-669-450-985; 035-955-210-517-684; 036-422-267-653-278; 037-508-483-777-156; 038-757-015-661-906; 042-153-814-549-651; 045-686-584-918-132; 047-314-376-402-583; 049-693-497-494-117; 051-051-388-372-679; 066-164-774-531-872; 073-491-460-889-056; 076-798-378-227-091; 080-335-833-184-550; 090-773-614-592-186; 102-159-262-985-245; 106-082-641-394-448; 106-405-247-587-560; 110-418-381-719-71X; 118-765-311-316-103; 119-406-418-983-290; 135-516-451-733-047; 137-490-839-857-724; 141-379-047-933-361; 148-509-688-849-44X; 156-301-586-809-014; 176-389-900-566-407,10,,(magid) 2900433568; (pii) s18113794; (pmid) 30404175; (pmcid) pmc6263876; (doi) 10.3390/s18113794,en

Kocaman; C. Gokceoglu,"<jats:p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract.&lt;/strong&gt; The developments in the geospatially-enabled mobile communication technologies have opened new horizons in many fields of geosciences research, especially in those where data collection, processing and interpretation are time consuming and costly. Being one of these research fields, natural hazards also require high spatiotemporal data density and distribution, which is extremely difficult to obtain and also equally essential to secure the main assumptions of these researches and thus yield to proper conclusions. These problems can be solved with the help of citizen science (CitSci) methods and the volunteer geographical information (VGI). These two terms are complementary, or intertwined, and mutually benefit from each other for achieving their goals. This paper investigates the developments in CitSci and VGI with a specific focus of natural hazard researches and gives a brief overview of the literature. The importance of their use in natural hazards, open research areas and future aspects are also analysed. Based on the previous experiences and analyses, the authors foresee that such investigations would help researchers to utilize CitSci and VGI in their studies, and thus benefit the advantages of both approaches and improve the quality of their data. On the other hand, the growing interest of citizen scientists for supporting scientific processes could be steered to the fields where most help is needed. Specifically, detection of ground deformations after earthquakes is explained here and a simple mobile app developed for landslide data collection is briefly depicted as use case.&lt;/p&gt;;                     </jats:p>",XLII-5,,69,73,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-xlii-5-69-2018,10.5194/isprs-archives-xlii-5-69-2018,,,0,,3,,(doi) 10.5194/isprs-archives-xlii-5-69-2018,en

This fact, together with floods and inundations, which occur in the city of Sao Paulo, makes it possible to explore the volunteered and collaborative way of generating and transmitting geographic data dynamically. This can be done by using technologies affordable to the population, such as the Internet, the global positioning system and other monitoring systems embedded in mobiles. This article aims to present the proposal of a conceptual scheme for a dynamic and collaborative mapping system of flooding points, whose data source comes from people equipped with mobile devices that allow identify their locations. The results correspond to the conceptual scheme of the system as well as the prototype ‘Flooding Points’ – a map available on the web showing the flooding points in the city, which were provided at the time of the event by ordinary people. The prototype was developed by using the free and open source Crowdmap/Ushahidi platform. The system was assessed by a questionnaire answered by the users, who gave their opinion about its feasibility, as well as the adjustments which must be made for the population's effective use. It was found that the application of system for subjects of inundation and flooding is complex in relation for other types of events due to its temporal dynamics characteristics. The results of the questionnaire, applied to evaluate the system, demonstrated the public utility of the application and the interest of the population for a dynamic system that enables the exchange of information on the problem of inundation and flooding in near real time in the city of Sao Paulo.",11,,S98,S109,The Internet; Natural disaster; Flooding (psychology); Data science; Population; Conceptual schema; Computer security; Computer science; Collaborative mapping; Volunteered geographic information; Global Positioning System,,,,CNPq (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico),https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jfr3.12181 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/jfr3.12181 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfr3.12181/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfr3.12181,10.1111/jfr3.12181,1513897899,,0,002-558-078-851-75X; 008-655-662-451-459; 008-714-358-699-609; 016-174-730-654-729; 023-036-742-444-209; 024-908-127-778-807; 025-847-175-638-067; 040-184-564-272-635; 057-545-918-303-995; 058-122-983-377-028; 064-698-573-941-895; 072-243-912-426-29X; 072-425-953-553-022; 082-366-214-673-579; 091-143-618-066-204; 091-172-107-530-75X; 118-057-611-878-127; 140-455-168-297-766; 147-826-896-424-422; 157-576-454-051-597,21,,(magid) 1513897899; (doi) 10.1111/jfr3.12181,en

Sensor networks have been identified as a major information source for the Digital Earth, while Semantic Web technologies have been proposed to facilitate integration. So far, sensor data are stored and published using the Observations & Measurements standard of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) as data model. With the advent of Volunteered Geographic Information and the Semantic Sensor Web, work on an ontological model gained importance within Sensor Web Enablement (SWE). In contrast to data models, an ontological approach abstracts from implementation details by focusing on modeling the physical world from the perspective of a particular domain. Ontologies restrict the interpretation of vocabularies toward their intended meaning. The ongoing paradigm shift to Linked Sensor Data complements this attempt.

Currently, geographic gazetteers capture little more than then the centroid of a neighborhood, limiting potential applications of the data. In this paper, we present µ-shapes, an algorithm that employs fuzzy-set theory to model neighborhood boundaries suitable for populating gazetteers using volunteered geographic information (VGI). The algorithm is evaluated using a reference dataset and VGI from the Map Kibera Project. A confusion matrix comparison between the reference dataset and µ-shape's output demonstrated high sensitivity and accuracy. Analysis of variance indicated that the algorithm was able to distinguish between boundary and interior blocks. This suggests that, given the existing state of GIS technology, the µ-shapes algorithm can enable neighborhood-related queries that incorporate spatial uncertainty, e.g., find all restaurants within the core of a neighborhood",2016,12,29,43,Data mining; Confusion matrix; Centroid; Limiting; Geography; Reference dataset; Volunteered geographic information,,,,,https://paperity.org/p/84922651/u-shapes-delineating-urban-neighborhoods-using-volunteered-geographic-information https://digitalcommons.library.umaine.edu/josis/vol2016/iss12/2/ https://digitalcommons.library.umaine.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1077&context=josis http://josis.org/index.php/josis/article/viewArticle/240 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/josis/josis12.html#AadlandFM16,http://dx.doi.org/10.5311/josis.2016.12.240,10.5311/josis.2016.12.240,1526600180,,0,006-222-581-706-927; 006-426-203-312-394; 007-512-109-812-832; 010-200-924-617-764; 010-469-991-531-778; 010-481-003-462-765; 011-951-489-170-796; 012-405-413-077-024; 013-695-653-991-514; 015-772-149-406-67X; 018-944-179-546-339; 019-029-287-138-022; 019-244-306-823-888; 025-397-428-056-343; 029-842-414-315-146; 030-003-495-243-532; 030-652-019-086-855; 032-352-916-241-50X; 033-795-662-702-714; 034-516-209-057-288; 034-601-708-547-392; 037-787-422-683-433; 042-592-616-107-814; 043-925-935-878-279; 045-201-107-411-584; 056-555-908-374-266; 075-796-006-914-012; 078-256-516-793-70X; 080-288-596-378-300; 101-393-503-985-203; 113-596-953-261-486; 125-477-365-617-988; 127-108-245-874-794; 129-966-285-735-821; 133-225-735-145-404; 139-554-362-435-673; 141-494-420-718-509; 141-656-278-343-767; 167-374-475-193-620; 174-469-560-302-647; 193-169-477-260-727,1,,(doi) 10.5311/josis.2016.12.240; (magid) 1526600180; (coreid) 92018572,en

In 2005, parvovirus 4 (PARV4), a new putative member of the family Parvoviridae, was identified in the plasma of a patient in North America who had an acute virus infection (1). This virus had limited sequence homology with parvovirus B19 (<30% aa similarity) despite a conserved genomic organization showing 2 large nonoverlapping open reading frames (ORF). Phylogenetic studies performed with near-complete sequences have proposed that human PARV4 can be described by ≥3 genogroups (2).; ; Little information is available about the natural history of the virus, and its clinical role remains unknown. Initial studies showed that PARV4 was present in the blood of febrile patients, intravenous drug users, and persons positive for hepatitis C virus or HIV at prevalences of 6%–30% (3–5). Two recent studies also showed the virus in cohorts of kidney transplant patients (6,7). PARV4 has also been identified in persons without apparent pathologic changes, such as blood donors (1.0%–3.95%), and in blood products negative for parvovirus B19 DNA (4–6). Virus DNA also was found in bone marrow and various tissues or organs, suggesting possible dispersion of the virus in diverse biologic locations (8).; ; To provide new insights into the dispersion of PARV4 in healthy persons, we assessed the frequency of PARV4 viremia in a cohort of blood donors by using a dual real-time assay. A total of 304 volunteer blood donors (154 men; mean age of all volunteers 40 years) living in southeastern France entered the study. The sex ratio (men:women: 1.03) and age distribution (19–65 years) of the cohort were considered representative of the population of blood donors at that time. Blood samples were collected in vacuum tubes (Vacutainer, SST, Becton Dickinson, Meylan, France) and centrifuged, and 1-mL plasma aliquots were stored at −80°C until use. Nucleic acids were extracted as described previously (7) and tested for PARV4 genomic DNA immediately after extraction to avoid freezing/thawing cycles.; ; Five microliters of the eluted material served for PARV4 DNA detection using real-time PCR TaqMan methods (StepOne Plus, Applied Biosystems, Courtaboeuf, France) and primers (ORF2) compatible with the detection of the 3 virus genogroups described at this time (2,4,7). Two probes were tested in separate amplification assays: PARV4-O (5′-FAM-TGTTCAACTTTCTCAGGTCCTACCGCCC-TAMRA-3′) (4,7) and PARV4-N (5′-FAM-TCCTACYGCCCSCTCCTCCTTCTT-TAMRA-3′). The second primer was designed after identification and sequencing of several in-house real-time PCR products (GenBank accession nos. {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""FJ883557"",""term_id"":""281192513"",""term_text"":""FJ883557""}}FJ883557–61), and more particularly those detectable on agarose gels but showing negative signal with PARV4-O TaqMan assay because of mismatches identified on the probe recognition site (Figure). Amplification reactions were performed as described previously (7). Both TaqMan assays were estimated to detect as few as 10 copies of PARV4 DNA per reaction using dilutions of a synthetic template (7).; ; ; ; Figure; ; Alignment of parvovirus 4 (PARV4) sequences showing the location of the 2 probes used in the real-time experiments. A) Partial sequences used for the design of probe PARV4-N: PARV4 prototype isolate ({""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""AY622943"",""term_id"":""52854178"",""term_text"":""AY622943""}} ...; ; ; ; Fifteen (4.9%) blood donors gave positive signal with probe PARV4-O; 62 (20.4%) were positive with probe PARV4-N; 6 (2.0%) samples were positive in both assays. Overall prevalence for PARV4 DNA was 24.0% in the blood donors tested.; ; PARV4 origin of randomly selected PCR products from PARV4-O and PARV4-N TaqMan assays (5 each) was confirmed after cloning and M13 sequencing. Point mutations located on the PARV4-O recognition site were retrieved in amplicons originating from samples positive with PARV4-N assay (Figure). However, subsequent molecular studies aiming to characterize virus strains were not feasible because of the low titer of PARV4 DNA (<500 copies/mL of plasma) in positive samples. No specific correlation was identified between sex or geographic origin and PARV4 viremia, whereas analysis of the distribution of PARV4-positive samples in age groups highlighted a relative homogeneity throughout the corresponding cohort.; ; Our study shows that PARV4 infection is readily detectable in French blood donors. Prevalence results using probe PARV4-O were comparable to those obtained in previous studies involving healthy persons originating from various countries (4–6). Conversely, the high prevalence obtained by using probe PARV4-N was unexpected because only 1 study demonstrated a higher value (45.7%) after the investigation of PARV4 DNA in bone marrow aspirates of AIDS patients from Italy (9).; ; This finding suggests a larger dispersion of PARV4 than expected initially in the general population and highlights the need for improvement in detection systems directed toward PARV4 DNA, particularly by interlaboratory collaborations, in direct connection with studies investigating PARV4 genetic diversity. These considerations are consistent with the recent description of a new PARV4 genogroup in humans and characterization of highly divergent variants in bovine and porcine species (10). In addition, such data raise the question of the consequent persistence of PARV4 infection in healthy persons. Future studies need to explore both dispersion and potential clinical impact of PARV4 on infected hosts.",16,1,165,166,Genotype; TaqMan; Virology; Virus; Parvovirus; Population; Becton dickinson; Polymerase chain reaction; Amplicon; Biology,,Adult; Aged; Blood Donors; Female; France/epidemiology; Genotype; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Parvoviridae Infections/epidemiology; Parvovirus/genetics; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Young Adult,,,http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC2874354 https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00638944 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2874354/ https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20103011865.html https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/17914 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103011865 https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/16/1/09-0517_article.htm,http://dx.doi.org/10.3201/eid1601.090517,10.3201/eid1601.090517,1993067098,PMC2874354,0,012-658-353-814-824; 012-812-589-466-320; 019-910-768-180-946; 028-531-477-602-551; 037-768-861-483-093; 040-639-744-487-391; 051-489-448-561-508; 052-029-990-222-29X; 061-532-147-590-878; 073-256-266-540-520; 079-775-189-604-684; 107-037-439-938-142,22,,(doi) 10.3201/eid1601.090517; (coreid) 49948164; (magid) 1993067098; (pmcid) pmc2874354; (pmid) 20031076,fr; en

However, this is not the case for developing ones mainly because of low data availability in OSM. This study presents a time-series spatial analysis of Turkey OSM dataset, a developing country, between the year 2007 and 2015 to understand how the dataset has developed with time and space. Five different socio-economic factors of the region are tested to find their relationship, if any, with dataset growth. An east-west spatial trend in data density is observed within the country. <jats:italic>Population Density</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Literacy Level</jats:italic> of the region are found be the factors controlling it. It has also been observed that the street network of the region has followed the Exploration and Densification evolutionary model. High participation inequality is found within the OSM mappers, with only 5 of them responsible for the country’s 50% geo-data upload. Furthermore, it is found that these mappers use other Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) and government open-dataset to feed into OSM. This study is believed to bring some high level insights of OSM for a developing country which would be useful for geographers, open-data policy makers, VGI projects planners and data-curators to structure and deploy similar future projects.</jats:p>",11,1,140,151,Geography; Cartography,,,,,https://www.degruyter.com/view/journals/geo/11/1/article-p140.xml https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019OGeo...11...12Z/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/geo-2019-0012,10.1515/geo-2019-0012,2940206239,,0,008-714-358-699-609; 018-001-567-494-602; 022-473-450-579-960; 022-816-728-271-154; 024-740-917-570-107; 026-645-756-189-301; 026-839-507-648-103; 027-033-671-128-509; 028-739-825-417-25X; 030-217-575-405-566; 030-389-215-141-473; 030-975-962-975-895; 034-212-540-698-648; 036-917-956-752-348; 038-976-596-179-447; 039-008-601-346-536; 041-490-320-644-385; 045-931-774-627-519; 047-100-212-874-054; 057-545-918-303-995; 065-721-408-933-444; 066-101-498-522-68X; 080-711-536-952-88X; 083-815-629-123-031; 084-376-137-252-907; 088-339-711-439-200; 097-612-174-011-049; 098-565-405-790-308; 100-487-196-651-545; 100-866-038-545-202; 106-264-944-278-433; 124-043-027-110-303; 129-909-646-150-845; 131-202-499-073-829; 133-439-587-267-381; 136-570-589-999-562; 141-379-047-933-361; 145-350-454-429-564; 147-876-713-700-216; 148-509-688-849-44X; 164-241-021-060-446; 165-247-631-308-780; 190-216-777-739-959; 195-019-623-135-107,3,,(doi) 10.1515/geo-2019-0012; (magid) 2940206239,en

Yair Grinberger; Clemens Jacobs; Carolin Klonner; Martin Raifer,"People share data in different ways. Many of them contribute on a voluntary basis, while others are unaware of their contribution. They have differing intentions, collaborate in different ways, and they contribute data about differing aspects. Shared Data Sources have been explored individually in the literature, in particular OpenStreetMap and Twitter, and some types of Shared Data Sources have widely been studied, such as Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI), Ambient Geographic Information (AGI), and Public Participation Geographic Information Systems (PPGIS). A thorough and systematic discussion of Shared Data Sources in their entirety is, however, still missing. For the purpose of establishing such a discussion, we introduce in this article a schema consisting of a number of dimensions for characterizing socially produced, maintained, and used ‘Shared Data Sources,’ as well as corresponding visualization techniques. Both the schema and the visualization techniques allow for a common characterization in order to set individual data sources into context and to identify clusters of Shared Data Sources with common characteristics. Among others, this makes possible choosing suitable Shared Data Sources for a given task and gaining an understanding of how to interpret them by drawing parallels between several Shared Data Sources.",8,5,242,,Semantics; Creative visualization; Schema (psychology); Data science; Parallels; Individual data; Visualization; Computer science; Public participation GIS; Volunteered geographic information,,,,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; Heidelberg Academy of Sciences and Humanities; Klaus Tschira Stiftung; Alexander von Humboldt Foundation,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi8050242 https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/8/5/242/pdf https://research.utwente.nl/en/publications/shared-data-sources-in-the-geographical-domain-a-classification-s https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ijgi/ijgi8.html#MocnikLGJKR19 http://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi8050242 https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/8/5/242 https://utwente-staging.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/shared-data-sources-in-the-geographical-domain-a-classification-s https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/6492372 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019IJGI....8..242M/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi8050242,10.3390/ijgi8050242,2947736071,,0,000-762-412-801-711; 008-655-662-451-459; 012-186-327-868-13X; 015-054-051-983-034; 017-614-610-102-13X; 021-064-137-577-13X; 022-473-450-579-960; 023-351-967-000-166; 024-198-307-847-685; 025-919-929-646-611; 030-975-962-975-895; 032-957-523-378-339; 035-965-510-297-942; 038-976-596-179-447; 039-519-441-643-068; 040-136-840-595-371; 040-734-834-983-378; 042-768-442-032-678; 045-258-513-547-978; 051-285-080-856-898; 054-859-619-242-072; 057-545-918-303-995; 059-363-255-514-892; 094-314-021-427-743; 097-612-174-011-049; 097-773-332-306-457; 102-160-469-693-977; 110-092-876-683-213; 122-721-229-359-374; 124-043-027-110-303; 128-630-302-259-009; 132-151-415-414-497; 147-851-179-732-398; 165-522-729-323-27X; 182-860-695-091-455,5,,(doi) 10.3390/ijgi8050242; (magid) 2947736071,en

So far, only little research has been conducted to understand the role and the evolution of folksonomies in VGI and OSM, which is despite the fact that without a comprehension of the folksonomies the thematic dimension of data can hardly be used. This article examines the history of the OSM folksonomy, with the aim to predict its future evolution. In particular, we explore how the documentation of the OSM folksonomy relates to its actual use in the data, and we investigate the historical and future scope and granularity of the folksonomy.

This development has raised a need to cover VGI at various educational levels, which has led to a number of new classes on VGI ranging from elementary through secondary school to undergraduate and graduate university curricula. In this chapter, we give an overview of the state of the art of VGI in education at these different levels. We outline different ways of introducing VGI in class. Specifically, we have investigated the long-term effects of using VGI in education to find out whether students who have come across VGI in class remain interested in the topic and engage in the communities. For this purpose, we have created a survey that was circulated among students of past VGI classes at different levels. The evaluation of the 202 completed surveys gives an overview of motivations and impediments with respect to different VGI platforms.

Case Study of OpenStreetMap for Routing of People with Limited Mobility,2017-06-09,2017,journal article,Sustainability,20711050,MDPI AG,Switzerland,Amin Mobasheri; Yeran Sun; Lukas Loos; Ahmed Loai Ali,"Nowadays, Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) has increasingly gained attractiveness to both amateur users and professionals. Using data generated from the crowd has become a hot topic for several application domains including transportation. However, there are concerns regarding the quality of such datasets. As one of the most famous crowdsourced mapping platforms, we analyze the fitness for use of OpenStreetMap (OSM) database for routing and navigation of people with limited mobility. We assess the completeness of OSM data regarding sidewalk information. Relevant attributes for sidewalk information such as sidewalk width, incline, surface texture, etc. are considered, and through both extrinsic and intrinsic quality analysis methods, we present the results of fitness for use of OSM data for routing services of disabled persons. Based on empirical results, it is concluded that OSM data of relatively large spatial extents inside all studied cities could be an acceptable region of interest to test and evaluate wheelchair routing and navigation services, as long as other data quality parameters such as positional accuracy and logical consistency are checked and proved to be acceptable. We present an extended version of OSMatrix web service and explore how it is employed to perform spatial and temporal analysis of sidewalk data completeness in OSM. The tool is beneficial for piloting activities, whereas the pilot site planners can query OpenStreetMap and visualize the degree of sidewalk data availability in a certain region of interest. This would allow identifying the areas that data are mostly missing and plan for data collection events. Furthermore, empirical results of data completeness for several OSM data indicators and their potential relation to sidewalk data completeness are presented and discussed. Finally, the article ends with an outlook for future research study in this area",9,6,997,,Data collection; Data quality; Data science; Open data; Wheelchair; Limited mobility; Web service; Completeness (statistics); Computer science; Volunteered geographic information,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/gam/jsusta/v9y2017i6p997-d101040.html https://core.ac.uk/display/84148476 http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/143444/ https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/6519668,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su9060997,10.3390/su9060997,2622715095,,0,004-445-599-749-605; 007-928-023-461-84X; 008-714-358-699-609; 014-348-277-735-954; 015-784-251-884-385; 017-008-646-646-77X; 020-132-620-861-048; 021-737-599-740-214; 022-473-450-579-960; 023-290-850-444-285; 027-796-527-585-268; 028-199-290-619-626; 029-340-611-176-878; 030-416-570-557-01X; 030-975-962-975-895; 034-307-681-264-511; 038-976-596-179-447; 059-313-507-808-403; 064-149-288-666-423; 065-756-732-102-183; 078-723-777-751-110; 081-895-906-885-174; 086-329-388-138-19X; 088-339-711-439-200; 097-338-432-344-323; 097-612-174-011-049; 106-264-944-278-433; 127-179-612-736-798; 133-772-872-454-193; 144-181-346-432-896; 145-350-454-429-564,27,,(coreid) 88819326; (doi) 10.3390/su9060997; (magid) 2622715095,en

Studies on landslides can also take advantage of these approaches to a great extent. However, the quality of the collected data by both approaches is often questionable, and automated procedures to check the quality are needed for this purpose. In the present study, a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is proposed to validate landslide photos collected by citizens or nonexperts and integrated into a mobile- and web-based GIS environment designed specifically for a landslide CitSci project. The VGG16 has been used as the base model since it allows finetuning, and high performance could be achieved by selecting the best hyper-parameters. Although the training dataset was small, the proposed CNN architecture was found to be effective as it could identify the landslide photos with 94% precision. The accuracy of the results is sufficient for purpose and could even be improved further using a larger amount of training data, which is expected to be obtained with the help of volunteers.",8,7,300,,Architecture; Landslide; Citizen science; Data quality; Data science; Computer science; Training set; Volunteered geographic information; Convolutional neural network; Geospatial analysis,,,,,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi8070300 https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/6545876 https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/8/7/300 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ijgi/ijgi8.html#CanKG19 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019IJGI....8..300C/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi8070300,10.3390/ijgi8070300,2959500497,,0,002-736-669-668-761; 007-254-781-410-576; 009-615-831-062-586; 015-713-346-650-356; 017-601-374-381-591; 018-753-298-831-085; 025-808-214-918-415; 029-151-898-564-153; 032-912-176-731-150; 035-617-524-799-125; 040-345-907-238-389; 040-744-620-090-370; 041-056-605-156-906; 046-672-381-479-837; 046-894-995-007-483; 048-166-072-130-835; 057-545-918-303-995; 062-139-351-975-05X; 063-514-359-451-398; 071-657-310-585-473; 077-437-033-728-82X; 080-340-127-423-40X; 085-287-497-018-702; 089-259-805-469-001; 089-830-070-344-186; 090-926-926-844-623; 095-442-257-313-366; 097-612-174-011-049; 097-998-758-075-462; 101-585-102-077-032; 105-922-900-686-940; 115-335-809-541-253; 119-429-953-512-716; 128-630-302-259-009; 135-254-390-808-772; 143-617-057-005-116; 148-228-530-106-602; 152-012-145-445-132; 166-881-092-568-595; 187-784-763-443-572,17,,(magid) 2959500497; (doi) 10.3390/ijgi8070300,en

Although the downward trend that these studies show is clear, they are limited to certain insect groups and geographical locations. Most available studies (see overview in Sánchez-Bayo and Wyckhuys 2019) were performed in nature reserves, leaving rural and urban areas largely understudied. Most studies are based on the long-term collaborative efforts of entomologists and volunteers performing labor-intensive repeat measurements, inherently limiting the number of locations that can be monitored. </jats:p>;           <jats:p>We propose a monitoring network for insects in the Netherlands, consisting of a large number of <jats:italic>smart</jats:italic> insect cameras spread across nature, rural, and urban areas. The aim of the network is to provide a labor-extensive continuous monitoring of different insect groups. In addition, we aimed to develop the cameras at a relatively cheap price point so that cameras can be installed at a large number of locations and encourage participation by citizen science enthusiasts. The cameras are made smart with image processing, consisting of image enhancement, insect detection and species identification being performed, using deep learning based algorithms. The cameras take pictures of a screen, measuring ca. 30×40 cm, every 10 seconds, capturing insects that have landed on the screen (Fig. 1). Several screen setups were evaluated. Vertical screens were used to attract flying insects. Different screen colors and lighting at night, to attract night flying insects such as moths, were used. In addition two horizontal screen orientations were used (1) to emulate pan traps to attract several pollinator species (bees and hoverflies) and (2) to capture ground-based insects and arthropods such as beetles and spiders. </jats:p>;           <jats:p>Time sequences of images were analyzed semi-automatically, in the following way. First, single insects are outlined and cropped using boxes at every captured image. Then the cropped single insects in every image were preliminarily identified, using a previously developed deep-learning-based automatic species identification software, Nature Identification API (https://identify.biodiversityanalysis.nl). In the next step, single insects were linked between consecutive images using a tracking algorithm that uses screen position and the preliminary identifications. This step yields for every individual insect a linked series of outlines and preliminary identifications. The preliminary identifications for individual insects can differ between multiple captured images and were therefore combined into one identification using a fusing algorithm. The result of the algorithm is a series of tracks of individual insects with species identifications, which can be subsequently translated into an estimate of the counts of insects per species or species complexes. </jats:p>;           <jats:p>Here we show the first set of results acquired during the spring and summer of 2019. We will discuss practical experiences with setting up cameras in the field, including the effectiveness of the different set-ups. We will also show the effectiveness of using automatic species identification in the type of images that were acquired (see attached figure) and discuss to what extent individual species can be identified reliably. Finally, we will discuss the ecological information that can be extracted from the smart insect cameras. </jats:p>",3,,,,Human–computer interaction; Biodiversity; Geography; Insect,,,,,https://biss.pensoft.net/article/39241/ https://biss.pensoft.net/article/39241/download/pdf/,http://dx.doi.org/10.3897/biss.3.39241,10.3897/biss.3.39241,2969647492,,0,009-617-824-319-389; 059-516-312-717-587; 063-389-299-439-329,2,,(doi) 10.3897/biss.3.39241; (magid) 2969647492,en

Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) has been a constantly growing field over the last decade, but the utilised technologies (i.e., mobile phones) are not able to exploit the full potential concerning effort and accuracy of registering geographic data. This paper introduces the GeoAR Glasses, a novel technology enabling the use of Geographic-Aware Augmented Reality for Mobile Geographic Information Systems (Mobile GIS) and Location-Based Services (LBS). The potentials of the GeoAR Glasses with respect to current mobile mapping applications is shown by means of an in-situ study (N=42) comparing two different modes of collecting VGI data. For the comparison we take into account the accuracy of the mapped data points and the time needed to complete the mapping. The results show that the GeoAR Glasses outperform the mobile application concerning both positional accuracy and completion time.;                     </jats:p>",2,,1,9,Augmented reality; Exploit; Data point; Data science; Mobile mapping; In situ study; Completion time; Computer science; Geographic information system; Volunteered geographic information,,,,,https://www.adv-cartogr-giscience-int-cartogr-assoc.net/2/3/2019/ica-adv-2-3-2019.pdf https://noa.gwlb.de/receive/cop_mods_00040750 https://www.adv-cartogr-giscience-int-cartogr-assoc.net/2/3/2019/,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/ica-adv-2-3-2019,10.5194/ica-adv-2-3-2019,2986183928,,0,,1,,(doi) 10.5194/ica-adv-2-3-2019; (magid) 2986183928,en

Bonde; Bernat C. López; Finn Danielsen; Jan Kristoffer Legind; Siro Masinde; Abraham J. Miller-Rushing; Greg Newman; Alyssa H. Rosemartin; Eren Turak,"To meet collective obligations towards biodiversity conservation and monitoring, it is essential that the world's governments and non-governmental organisations as well as the research community tap all possible sources of data and information, including new, fast-growing sources such as citizen science (CS), in which volunteers participate in some or all aspects of environmental assessments. Through compilation of a database on CS and community-based monitoring (CBM, a subset of CS) programs, we assess where contributions from CS and CBM are significant and where opportunities for growth exist. We use the Essential Biodiversity Variable framework to describe the range of biodiversity data needed to track progress towards global biodiversity targets, and we assess strengths and gaps in geographical and taxonomic coverage. Our results show that existing CS and CBM data particularly provide large-scale data on species distribution and population abundance, species traits such as phenology, and ecosystem function variables such as primary and secondary productivity. Only birds, Lepidoptera and plants are monitored at scale. Most CS schemes are found in Europe, North America, South Africa, India, and Australia. We then explore what can be learned from successful CS/CBM programs that would facilitate the scaling up of current efforts, how existing strengths in data coverage can be better exploited, and the strategies that could maximise the synergies between CS/CBM and other approaches for monitoring biodiversity, in particular from remote sensing. More and better targeted funding will be needed, if CS/CBM programs are to contribute further to international biodiversity monitoring.",213,9,280,294,Environmental resource management; Ecosystem; Measurement of biodiversity; Biodiversity; Global biodiversity; Citizen science; Geography; Community-based monitoring; Population abundance; Biodiversity conservation,,,,German Research Foundation; Horizon 2020 ConnectinGEO,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/54d938bd https://arizona.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/contribution-of-citizen-science-towards-international-biodiversit https://core.ac.uk/display/83641533 http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/13923/ https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320716303639 https://www.openchannels.org/literature/1452188640 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320716303639 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82693501.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2016.09.004,10.1016/j.biocon.2016.09.004,2548118086,,0,000-826-091-294-906; 002-008-275-564-489; 005-331-876-286-153; 010-631-110-376-476; 011-532-085-210-521; 013-297-052-431-067; 017-398-862-752-207; 025-546-677-715-107; 025-781-933-439-19X; 029-178-373-486-64X; 031-128-639-251-714; 033-343-541-819-505; 035-657-807-131-48X; 038-026-427-199-878; 038-071-975-135-261; 040-242-624-767-430; 040-734-834-983-378; 041-973-163-277-054; 043-664-757-448-133; 043-854-781-355-014; 044-823-606-964-159; 046-654-934-179-609; 047-833-007-161-424; 047-947-630-225-026; 048-075-634-707-613; 051-374-473-154-39X; 054-000-930-637-34X; 056-834-710-018-225; 059-910-196-456-556; 062-161-337-598-068; 068-028-107-874-835; 068-518-217-291-309; 068-528-668-316-332; 070-256-518-437-572; 075-084-067-425-962; 076-105-094-695-139; 078-273-210-723-922; 081-398-405-715-575; 082-086-780-286-067; 082-760-208-517-233; 082-770-706-465-260; 082-812-338-269-612; 083-485-735-615-030; 084-374-719-159-703; 085-007-782-094-000; 088-097-320-222-179; 090-099-258-410-080; 091-084-649-788-667; 094-956-305-298-909; 095-940-991-247-342; 098-144-267-769-854; 103-081-387-145-206; 106-702-123-217-956; 106-895-914-258-731; 107-284-972-482-591; 107-502-249-850-861; 113-902-944-775-285; 122-605-771-746-413; 122-803-751-198-816; 123-409-384-372-114; 125-375-982-332-710; 134-662-002-252-589; 135-930-299-400-961; 136-921-702-226-329; 140-224-679-871-119; 161-706-415-849-94X; 179-875-713-885-456; 181-972-517-505-643; 182-860-695-091-455; 186-031-697-646-650,196,,(doi) 10.1016/j.biocon.2016.09.004; (magid) 2548118086; (coreid) 82693501,en

Comber; Cidália Costa Fonte; Giles M. Foody; Steffen Fritz; Paul Harris; Ana-Maria Olteanu-Raimond; Linda See,"There is much interest in being able to combine crowdsourced data. One of the critical issues in information sciences is how to combine data or information that are discordant or inconsistent in some way. Many previous approaches have taken a majority rules approach under the assumption that most people are correct most of the time. This paper analyses crowdsourced land cover data generated by the Geo-Wiki initiative in order to infer the land cover present at locations on a 50 km grid. It compares four evidence combination approaches (Dempster-Shafer, Bayes, Fuzzy Sets and Possibility) applied under a geographically weighted kernel with the geographically weighted average approach applied in many current Geo-Wiki analyses. A geographically weighted approach uses a moving kernel under which local analyses are undertaken. The contribution (or salience) of each data point to the analysis is weighted by its distance to the kernel centre, reflecting Tobler's 1st law of geography. A series of analyses were undertaken using different kernel sizes (or bandwidths). Each of the geographically weighted evidence combination methods generated spatially distributed measures of belief in hypotheses associated with the presence of individual land cover classes at each location on the grid. These were compared with GlobCover, a global land cover product. The results from the geographically weighted average approach in general had higher correspondence with the reference data and this increased with bandwidth. However, for some classes other evidence combination approaches had higher correspondences possibly because of greater ambiguity over class conceptualisations and / or lower densities of crowdsourced data. The outputs also allowed the beliefs in each class to be mapped. The differences in the soft and the crisp maps are clearly associated with the logics of each evidence combination approach and of course the different questions that they ask of the data. The results show that discordant data can be combined (rather than being removed from analysis) and that data integrated in this way can be parameterised by different measures of belief uncertainty. The discussion highlights a number of critical areas for future research.",20,3,503,527,Statistics; Data mining; Majority rule; Geography; Bayes' theorem; Data quality; Ambiguity; Land cover; Fuzzy set; Volunteered geographic information; Weighted arithmetic mean,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10707-016-0248-z https://repository.rothamsted.ac.uk/item/8v2x6/geographically-weighted-evidence-combination-approaches-for-combining-discordant-and-inconsistent-volunteered-geographical-information https://nottingham-repository.worktribe.com/output/774972 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/geoinformatica/geoinformatica20.html#ComberFFFHRS16 http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/95657/ https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s10707-016-0248-z http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/46660/ https://doi.org/10.1007/s10707-016-0248-z http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/13144/ https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2934807,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10707-016-0248-z,10.1007/s10707-016-0248-z,2291520663,,0,000-045-839-962-731; 002-555-907-164-663; 007-857-101-229-718; 010-390-048-140-045; 014-425-368-123-634; 021-841-854-481-10X; 026-645-756-189-301; 027-736-997-184-595; 034-811-933-377-954; 041-658-614-339-032; 050-086-348-838-909; 052-337-679-284-249; 053-343-939-169-19X; 053-620-292-475-147; 054-941-787-662-255; 057-545-918-303-995; 058-787-825-983-133; 064-150-749-224-539; 068-480-591-631-595; 078-510-882-265-123; 080-575-325-024-73X; 090-452-090-458-64X; 091-204-512-390-272; 092-585-387-075-369; 092-874-283-786-597; 094-493-112-438-794; 095-122-467-723-862; 097-612-174-011-049; 106-209-907-666-435; 123-071-990-086-470; 126-211-829-666-664; 128-448-195-196-442; 128-455-721-646-286; 141-047-060-911-705; 144-096-391-736-702; 146-162-474-114-293; 146-904-387-526-919; 154-893-104-685-012; 160-476-945-458-578; 188-532-735-023-541; 198-122-408-150-421,8,,(doi) 10.1007/s10707-016-0248-z; (magid) 2291520663; (coreid) 141294144,en
144-151-067-334-33X,The relationship between attitudes towards menarche and current attitudes towards menstruation of women: A comparative study,2015-11-13,2015,journal article,International Journal of Human Sciences,13035134,Uluslararasi Insan Bilimleri Dergisi,,Nülüfer Erbil; Neslihan Felek; Ebru Karakaşlı,"<jats:p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose:&lt;/strong&gt; The study was conducted to determine affecting factors and to investigate relationship  between  attitudes towards menarche and current attitudes towards menstruation of women and to compare characteristics of menarche and menstruation of women who were born and raised in the northeastern and western of Turkey. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method and Materials:&lt;/strong&gt; This descriptive and comparative study was participated totally 400 volunteer women.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The data were collected using a questionnaire containing defined closed and open-ended questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results: &lt;/strong&gt;The study results showed that women living in Ordu province than women living in Aydın province expressed positive attitudes toward menarche, and the difference was found significant. Nevertheless, attitudes towards current menstruation were similar in both provinces. When the data of 400 women were evaluated together; women’s attitudes towards menarche were compared with the current attitudes towards menstruation, and the difference was found statistically significant. Although attitudes of the women towards menarche varied according to where they lived, their current attitudes towards menstruation were similar. In addition, depending upon the province, there were statistically significant differences in women’s age at menarche, recollection of menarche, and feelings of shame or happiness at menarche, source and adequacy of information about menstruation, and regularity of their menstrual cycle.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/strong&gt; Early menstrual experiences may be related to menstrual experiences later in life and women’s attitudes towards menstruation were not affected by geographical locations. In order to develop positive attitudes towards menarche and a woman’s future years of menstrual cycles, it is very important that accurate and adequate information for young girls be provided before menarche. &lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>",12,2,1120,1130,Gender studies; Feeling; Demography; Happiness; Shame; Menarche; Medicine,,,,,http://www.j-humansciences.com/ojs/index.php/IJHS/article/view/3239/1566,http://dx.doi.org/10.14687/ijhs.v12i2.3239,10.14687/ijhs.v12i2.3239,2179787145,,0,002-293-662-630-197; 004-790-938-090-153; 006-926-422-850-361; 007-927-211-633-907; 011-339-433-938-128; 011-856-582-864-658; 023-027-601-069-199; 028-905-771-643-542; 034-747-638-584-703; 039-604-697-435-429; 042-624-506-011-92X; 052-666-440-466-478; 077-965-082-301-936; 087-519-445-729-409; 095-425-057-310-254; 123-220-418-901-960; 126-335-789-018-56X; 199-092-366-186-494,4,,(doi) 10.14687/ijhs.v12i2.3239; (magid) 2179787145,en

Siebritz; G. Sithole; Sisi Zlatanova,"<jats:p>Abstract. The potential for volunteer groups to contribute geographic data to National Mapping Agencies has been widely recognised. Several investigations have been done to determine the geometric accuracy of this data for the purposes of national mapping. Beyond accuracy, from a production perspective National Mapping Agencies will also be interested in the sufficiency and uniformity of the data. This paper presents an investigation of whether presently geographic data generated by volunteers is uniform across a country and whether the rate of production of data is consistent. For the purpose of the test, changes in data of South Africa from OpenStreetMap are analysed for the period 2006 to 2011. Here only point and line data are considered. The results generally show that the rate at which data is generated varies in space and time. The results also confirm that volunteers emphasise on the capture of certain information and that the capture doesn’t average out as might be expected. The results also showed that social events, such as a World Cup, also have the effect of spurring the generation of volunteer geographic data. The implication of these results for National Mapping Agencies is that they cannot treat volunteer geographic information as being of a uniform standard. How National Mapping Agencies respond to this will have to be the subject of other investigations.;                     </jats:p>",XXXIX-B4,1,553,558,Homogeneity (statistics); Geography; Volunteered geographic information; Cartography,,,,,https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid:738c772f-a5c1-4b06-8250-824cd8c2c33d/datastream/OBJ/download https://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/XXXIX-B4/553/2012/isprsarchives-XXXIX-B4-553-2012.pdf https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Atudelft.nl%3Auuid%3A738c772f-a5c1-4b06-8250-824cd8c2c33d http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ISPAr39B4..553S/abstract https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sisi_Zlatanova/publication/269710300_ASSESSMENT_OF_THE_HOMOGENEITY_OF_VOLUNTEERED_GEOGRAPHIC_INFORMATION_IN_SOUTH_AFRICA/links/5494c28b0cf20f487d2c4798.pdf https://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/XXXIX-B4/553/2012/ https://noa.gwlb.de/receive/cop_mods_00024792,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/isprsarchives-xxxix-b4-553-2012,10.5194/isprsarchives-xxxix-b4-553-2012,2130635846,,0,030-217-575-405-566; 040-267-517-107-219; 057-545-918-303-995; 070-639-089-849-20X; 072-243-912-426-29X; 088-339-711-439-200; 124-043-027-110-303; 169-004-007-623-620,11,,(coreid) 91989390; (doi) 10.5194/isprsarchives-xxxix-b4-553-2012; (magid) 2130635846,en
145-350-454-429-564,Comparison of Volunteered Geographic Information Data Contributions and Community Development for Selected World Regions,2013-06-03,2013,journal article,Future Internet,19995903,MDPI AG,Switzerland,Pascal Neis; Dennis Zielstra; Alexander Zipf,"Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) projects and their crowdsourced data have been the focus of a number of scientific analyses and investigations in recent years. Oftentimes the results show that the collaboratively collected geodata of one of the most popular VGI projects, OpenStreetMap (OSM), provides good coverage in urban areas when considering particular completeness factors. However, results can potentially vary significantly for different world regions. In this article, we conduct an analysis to determine similarities and differences in data contributions and community development in OSM between 12 selected urban areas of the world. Our findings showed significantly different results in data collection efforts and local OSM community sizes. European cities provide quantitatively larger amounts of geodata and number of contributors in OSM, resulting in a better representation of the real world in the dataset. Although the number of volunteers does not necessarily correlate with the general population density of the urban areas, similarities could be detected while comparing the percentage of different contributor groups and the number of changes they made to the OSM project. Further analyses show that socio-economic factors, such as income, can have an impact on the number of active contributors and the data provided in the analyzed areas.

Viana; Luis Encalada; Jorge Rocha,"OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a free, open-access Volunteered geographic information (VGI) platform that has been widely used over the last decade as a source for Land Use Land Cover (LULC) mapping and visualization. However, it is known that the spatial coverage and accuracy of OSM data are not evenly distributed across all regions, with urban areas being likelier to have promising contributions (in both quantity and quality) than rural areas. The present study used OSM data history to generate LULC datasets with one-year timeframes as a way to support regional and rural multi-temporal LULC mapping. We evaluated the degree to which the different OSM datasets agreed with two existing reference datasets (CORINE Land Cover and the official Portuguese Land Cover Map). We also evaluated whether our OSM dataset was of sufficiently high quality (in terms of both completeness accuracy and thematic accuracy) to be used as a sampling data source for multi-temporal LULC maps. In addition, we used the near boundary tag accuracy criterion to assesses the fitness of the OSM data for producing training samples, with promising results. For each annual dataset, the completeness ratio of the coverage area for the selected study area was low. Nevertheless, we found high thematic accuracy values (ranged from 77.3% to 91.9%). Additionally, the training samples thematic accuracy improved as they moved away from the features’ boundaries. Features with larger areas (>10 ha), e.g., Agriculture and Forest, had a steadily positive correlation between training samples accuracy and distance to feature boundaries.",8,3,116,,Rural area; Geography; Land cover; Land use land cover; Visualization; Land use; Volunteered geographic information; Cartography; Sampling (statistics); Thematic map,,,,Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019IJGI....8..116V/abstract http://repositorio.ul.pt/handle/10451/42796 https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/8/3/116 https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi8030116 https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/8/3/116/pdf https://repositorio.ul.pt/bitstream/10451/42796/1/Viana_Encalada_Rocha_2019.pdf https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ijgi/ijgi8.html#VianaER19,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi8030116,10.3390/ijgi8030116,2917519025,,0,002-555-907-164-663; 010-707-622-258-842; 020-132-620-861-048; 022-473-450-579-960; 027-120-436-467-741; 030-522-288-963-136; 030-975-962-975-895; 031-056-855-501-837; 034-212-540-698-648; 038-830-399-865-200; 038-976-596-179-447; 040-215-238-362-650; 042-768-442-032-678; 051-677-728-163-828; 053-620-292-475-147; 057-012-745-462-629; 057-545-918-303-995; 058-324-398-771-345; 060-515-184-203-565; 066-561-164-608-915; 066-988-074-809-599; 072-104-186-976-093; 082-811-823-576-339; 083-054-544-572-918; 083-320-665-247-563; 083-815-629-123-031; 086-758-442-428-039; 089-526-848-036-98X; 094-493-112-438-794; 097-612-174-011-049; 115-707-361-534-016; 128-630-302-259-009; 147-213-981-170-541; 147-876-713-700-216; 161-009-342-023-966,10,,(magid) 2917519025; (doi) 10.3390/ijgi8030116,en

Through an analytical framework describing five categories, we discuss the different scopes and possibilities, as well as general barriers and problems to participatory e-tools. We suggest some basic premises for the application of e-tools in urban green infrastructure governance and discussed future development of this field. E-tools can allow interaction between citizens, public authorities, and other stakeholders; however, research on the implications of such location-based governance is needed to make full use of the rapid on-going development of such information and communication technologies, and to avoid possible pitfalls.

Currently, the top-down spatial data update mechanism has made a big progress and it is wildly applied in many SDI (spatial data infrastructure). However, this mechanism still has some issues. For example, the update schedule is limited by the professional department’s project, usually which is too long for the end-user; the data form collection to public cost too much time and energy for professional department; the details of geospatial information does not provide sufficient attribute, etc. Thus, how to deal with the problems has become the effective shortcut. Emerging Internet technology, 3S technique and geographic information knowledge which is popular in the public promote the booming development of geoscience in volunteered geospatial information. Volunteered geospatial information is the current ""hotspot"", which attracts many researchers to study its data quality and credibility, accuracy, sustainability, social benefit, application and so on. In addition to this, a few scholars also pay attention to the value of VGI to support the SDI updating. And on that basis, this paper presents a bottom-up update mechanism form VGI to SDI, which includes the processes of match homonymous elements between VGI and SDI vector data , change data detection, SDI spatial database update and new data product publication to end-users. Then, the proposed updating cycle is deeply discussed about the feasibility of which can detect the changed elements in time and shorten the update period, provide more accurate geometry and attribute data for spatial data infrastructure and support update propagation.;                     </jats:p>",XXXIX-B4,1,445,448,The Internet; Top-down and bottom-up design; Spatial analysis; Spatial data infrastructure; Spatial database; Geography; Information retrieval; Data quality; Data science; Volunteered geographic information; Geospatial analysis,,,,,https://noa.gwlb.de/receive/cop_mods_00024775 https://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/XXXIX-B4/445/2012/isprsarchives-XXXIX-B4-445-2012.pdf https://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/XXXIX-B4/445/2012/ http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ISPAr39B4..445T/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/isprsarchives-xxxix-b4-445-2012,10.5194/isprsarchives-xxxix-b4-445-2012,1988781802,,0,048-456-967-705-578; 057-545-918-303-995; 082-811-823-576-339; 169-004-007-623-620,1,,(magid) 1988781802; (coreid) 91701244; (doi) 10.5194/isprsarchives-xxxix-b4-445-2012,en

This increases the usefulness of Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI), in particular OpenStreetMap (OSM), as supplementary datasets or, in some cases, alternative sources of primary data. In contrast to the OSM street network, which has already been thoroughly investigated and found to be practically complete in many areas, the degree of completeness of OSM data on buildings is still unclear. In this paper we describe methods to analyze building completeness and apply these to various test areas in Germany. Official data from national mapping and cadastral agencies is used as a basis for comparison. The results show that unit-based completeness measurements (e.g., total number or area of buildings) are highly sensitive to disparities in modeling between official data and VGI. Therefore, we recommend object-based methods to study the completeness of OSM building footprint data. An analysis from November 2011 in Germany indicated a completeness of 25% in the federal states of North Rhine-Westphalia and 15% in Saxony. Although further analyses from 2012 confirm that data completeness in Saxony has risen to 23%, the rate of new data input was slowing in the year 2012",2,4,1066,1091,Footprint; Cadastre; Geography; Spatial planning; Street network; Data input; Highly sensitive; Completeness (statistics); Volunteered geographic information; Cartography,,,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi2041066 https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/2/4/1066 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ijgi/ijgi2.html#HechtKH13 https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi2041066 https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/2/4/1066/pdf https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013IJGI....2.1066H/abstract http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi2041066,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi2041066,10.3390/ijgi2041066,2004492980,,0,005-016-151-527-407; 007-684-128-166-136; 015-547-304-212-023; 017-518-735-691-484; 021-032-292-258-861; 022-473-450-579-960; 026-645-756-189-301; 029-963-409-674-751; 030-217-575-405-566; 038-976-596-179-447; 043-714-141-467-996; 046-148-475-442-348; 047-965-422-384-128; 062-988-018-429-430; 063-995-666-971-756; 073-444-621-771-816; 086-803-331-542-701; 088-339-711-439-200; 101-730-056-244-941; 105-002-127-589-526; 118-490-814-259-358; 119-018-794-488-15X; 129-909-646-150-845; 130-142-932-314-745; 161-284-745-113-233; 170-767-348-108-054; 171-445-174-201-21X,95,,(magid) 2004492980; (doi) 10.3390/ijgi2041066; (coreid) 27603835,en

Specifically, various aspects of imprecision and uncertainty of VGI are outlined and, to cope with them, a nowledge-based approach is suggested based on the creation and management of “contextualized VGI”. A case study example in agriculture is reported where contextualized VGI can be created bout in situ crops observations by the use of a smart app that supports volunteers by means of both an ontology and the representation of the context of the geo-localization. Furthermore, n approach to cope with both ill-defined knowledge and volunteer’s uncertainty or imprecise observations is defined based on a fuzzy ontology with uncertainty level-based approximate easoning. By representing uncertainty and imprecision of VGI, users, i.e., consumers, can exploit quality checking mechanisms to filter VGI based on their needs",5,12,234,,Exploit; Citizen science; Ontology; Approximate reasoning; Fuzzy ontology; Computer science; Knowledge management; Volunteered geographic information; Georeference,,,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/5/12/234 https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi5120234 https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/5/12/234/pdf https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ijgi/ijgi5.html#BordognaFKBHMS16 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016IJGI....5..234B/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi5120234,10.3390/ijgi5120234,2560594996,,0,015-346-038-166-464; 024-607-951-177-998; 032-903-495-847-439; 037-423-792-391-123; 048-946-362-388-145; 074-797-696-024-09X; 075-179-108-062-152; 079-232-905-814-527; 091-777-985-390-510; 131-161-724-039-419; 138-653-700-668-291; 158-400-294-926-346; 160-557-925-523-840; 171-603-091-805-932; 181-072-396-769-365; 193-375-318-674-460,8,,(magid) 2560594996; (coreid) 98362925; (doi) 10.3390/ijgi5120234,en

This process has produced an opportunity for fascinating geographical research into the ways in which community heritage groups produce history from their own perspective. This paper will therefore begin to open up these ongoing processes to consider, through case study examples, the ways in which the production of digital archives alters the geography of community heritage production. A number of community heritage groups have been converting their 'analogue' collections into 'digital' forms and the paper will argue how this significantly alters the positionality of the archive. This will be shown by detailing the ways in which the processes of collection and preservation, conducted by community volunteers, take place. The paper will then move to consider the ways in which this historical material, representative of place, is presented back to a wider audience. In doing this, it will discuss the rationales and processes involved in these practices and how this relates to broader themes of research within geography. Whether for historical research or for theoretical positioning, geographers have, on a number of levels, engaged with archives.

The increased availability of spatiotemporal data collected from satellite imagery and other remote sensors provides opportunities for enhanced analysis of Spatiotemporal Patterns. This area can be defined as efficiently discovering interesting patterns from large data sets. The discovery of hidden periodic patterns in spatiotemporal data could provide unveiling important information to the data analyst. In many applications that track and analyze spatiotemporal data, movements obey periodic patterns; the objects follow the same routes (approximately) over regular time intervals. However, these methods cannot directly be applied to a spatiotemporal sequence because of the fuzziness of spatial locations in the sequence. In this paper, we define the problem of mining VGI datasets with our already established bottom up algorithm for spatiotemporal data.",1,3,,,Data mining; Top-down and bottom-up design; Information retrieval; Satellite imagery; Remote sensors; Data analyst; Computer science; Volunteered geographic information; Data set; Spatiotemporal database,,,,,https://thesai.org/Publications/ViewPaper?Volume=1&Issue=3&Code=SpecialIssue&SerialNo=19 https://thesai.org/Downloads/SpecialIssueNo3/Paper%2019-Mining%20Volunteered%20Geographic%20Information%20datasets%20with%20heterogeneous%20spatial%20reference.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.14569/specialissue.2011.010319,10.14569/specialissue.2011.010319,1993550780,,0,026-968-603-410-083; 045-029-373-831-213; 062-441-104-889-477; 080-820-657-377-829; 083-829-413-249-097; 121-211-338-576-232; 126-528-028-079-748; 162-509-740-935-570; 186-759-829-801-053,1,,(doi) 10.14569/specialissue.2011.010319; (magid) 1993550780,en

153-764-793-207-835,Local Knowledge and Professional Background Have a Minimal Impact on Volunteer Citizen Science Performance in a Land-Cover Classification Task,2016-09-20,2016,journal article,Remote Sensing,20724292,MDPI AG,Switzerland,Carl F. Salk; Tobias Sturn; Linda See; Steffen Fritz,"The idea that closer things are more related than distant things, known as ‘Tobler’s first law of geography’, is fundamental to understanding many spatial processes. If this concept applies to volunteered geographic information (VGI), it could help to efficiently allocate tasks in citizen science campaigns and help to improve the overall quality of collected data. In this paper, we use classifications of satellite imagery by volunteers from around the world to test whether local familiarity with landscapes helps their performance. Our results show that volunteers identify cropland slightly better within their home country, and do slightly worse as a function of linear distance between their home and the location represented in an image. Volunteers with a professional background in remote sensing or land cover did no better than the general population at this task, but they did not show the decline with distance that was seen among other participants. Even in a landscape where pasture is easily confused for cropland, regional residents demonstrated no advantage. Where we did find evidence for local knowledge aiding classification performance, the realized impact of this effect was tiny. Rather, the inherent difficulty of a task is a much more important predictor of volunteer performance. These findings suggest that, at least for simple tasks, the geographical origin of VGI volunteers has little impact on their ability to complete image classifications",8,9,774,,Tobler's first law of geography; Data mining; Citizen science; Geography; Data quality; Data science; Satellite imagery; Land cover; Population; Volunteered geographic information; Crowdsourcing,,,,European Research Council,http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/13974/ https://core.ac.uk/display/90208211 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/remotesensing/remotesensing8.html#SalkSSF16 https://pub.epsilon.slu.se/14274/ https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016RemS....8..774S/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs8090774,10.3390/rs8090774,2522266675,,0,002-846-418-538-652; 006-548-035-543-374; 007-857-101-229-718; 020-132-620-861-048; 021-041-484-242-674; 028-338-041-114-464; 030-217-575-405-566; 033-085-475-899-252; 040-345-907-238-389; 041-490-320-644-385; 041-658-614-339-032; 043-825-278-981-912; 046-169-973-770-822; 047-833-007-161-424; 048-400-414-195-536; 053-620-292-475-147; 054-511-445-518-675; 065-505-148-413-082; 067-684-027-985-542; 077-826-390-968-564; 097-612-174-011-049; 107-506-665-596-354; 125-834-147-179-951; 128-448-195-196-442; 141-047-060-911-705; 142-739-577-296-892; 143-337-201-417-742; 147-769-223-868-127; 158-400-294-926-346; 167-275-555-617-549; 171-243-981-870-721; 190-216-777-739-959,7,,(doi) 10.3390/rs8090774; (magid) 2522266675; (coreid) 90208211,en

Miller (2013) contends the need to identify new capabilities (instead of capacity) of the transport infrastructure in order to increase efficiency without extending the physical infrastructure. Kenyon and Lyons (2003) identified integrated traveller information as a facilitator for better transport decisions. Today, with further developments in the use of geographic information systems (GIS) and a greater disposition by the public to provide volunteered geographic information (VGI), the potential of information is not only integrated across modes but also user-generated, real-time and available on smartphones anywhere. This geographic information plays today an important role in sectors such as politics, businesses and entertainment, and presumably this would extend to transport in revealing people’s preferences for mobility and therefore be useful for decision-making. The widespread availability of networks and smartphones offer new opportunities supported by apps and crowdsourcing through social media such as the successful traffic and navigation app Waze, car sharing programmes such as Zipcar, and ride sharing systems such as Uber. This study aims to develop insights into the potential of governments to use voluntary (crowdsourced) geographic information effectively to achieve sustainable mobility. A review of the literature and existing technology informs this article.

Vujičić; Cezar Morar; Liviu Bucur,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>; <jats:p>The practice of producing drone videos for hobby or commercial purposes has already created a vast amount of open and free video datasets. When these videos are properly authored, time-stamped and geo-referenced, they receive characteristics of volunteered geographic information (VGI). As alternative forms to user-generated content (UGC), these visually appealing footages attract significant attention, but their production faces different practical and motivational issues that could impose limitation on the value of this kind of VGI. In order to better understand volunteered geographic drone videos (VGDV) from the social media and VGI perspective we conceptualize and discuss prospects and problems that could be explored in further research. This paper contributes to the development of theory about aerial drone videos, exploration of aerial drone video UGC characteristics and to the applicability of drone videos in Digital Earth systems.</jats:p>",11,1,462,470,User-generated content; Digital Earth; World Wide Web; Sociology; Volunteered geographic information; Drone,,,,,https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/geo.2019.11.issue-1/geo-2019-0037/geo-2019-0037.xml?lang=en,http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/geo-2019-0037,10.1515/geo-2019-0037,2973781779,,0,004-939-576-509-393; 006-594-859-260-163; 007-091-393-080-217; 008-655-662-451-459; 008-775-002-924-392; 011-734-258-322-43X; 012-600-938-809-084; 016-582-007-030-207; 017-167-454-912-226; 018-214-007-987-301; 021-725-130-167-598; 023-351-967-000-166; 023-384-261-144-492; 023-424-483-435-619; 030-285-378-999-064; 031-834-156-749-559; 032-136-173-614-89X; 032-499-623-544-837; 035-290-649-562-226; 036-244-364-061-718; 038-206-384-167-849; 041-628-445-609-646; 042-529-780-691-352; 042-779-016-328-20X; 044-755-108-735-79X; 045-039-968-824-863; 046-509-496-371-690; 049-552-476-301-92X; 057-545-918-303-995; 063-155-709-682-961; 067-420-440-257-793; 072-528-218-916-44X; 083-990-306-803-989; 088-535-756-565-284; 088-643-212-114-969; 097-634-925-629-825; 101-853-476-992-575; 104-269-317-461-124; 106-099-126-438-603; 110-063-196-217-742; 110-542-700-763-856; 111-751-939-014-491; 116-730-484-055-084; 118-460-883-654-864; 119-300-636-758-248; 122-741-973-347-61X; 130-167-840-435-639; 130-435-766-486-451; 134-852-542-377-611; 135-290-432-347-969; 145-619-635-958-157; 147-631-229-944-512; 153-409-118-115-578; 160-295-962-959-531; 167-346-933-471-045; 169-004-007-623-620; 170-355-256-827-042; 171-603-091-805-932; 181-702-211-559-198; 191-295-785-362-623,2,,(doi) 10.1515/geo-2019-0037; (magid) 2973781779,en

Hay,"The Heat Energy Assessment Technologies (HEAT) project uses high-resolution airborne thermal imagery, Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA), and a Geoweb environment to allow the residents of Calgary, Alberta, Canada to visualize the amount and location of waste heat leaving their houses, communities, and the city. To ensure the accuracy of these measures, the correct emissivity of roof materials needs to be known. However, roof material information is not readily available in the Canadian public domain. To overcome this challenge, a unique Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) application was developed using Google Street View that engages citizens to classify the roof materials of single dwelling residences in a simple and intuitive manner. Since data credibility, quality, and accuracy are major concerns when using VGI, a private Multiple Listing Services (MLS) dataset was used for cross-verification. From May–November 2013, 1244 volunteers from 85 cities and 14 countries classified 1815 roofs in the study area. Results show (I) a 72% match between the VGI and MLS data; and (II) in the majority of cases, roofs with greater than, or equal to five contributions have the same material defined in both datasets. Additionally, this research meets new challenges to the GEOBIA community to incorporate existing GIS vector data within an object-based workflow and engages the public to provide volunteered information for urban objects from which new geo-intelligence is created in support of urban energy efficiency",6,10,9691,9711,Workflow; Efficient energy use; Geoweb; Roof; Credibility; Geographic object; Computer science; Public domain; Volunteered geographic information; Remote sensing; Database,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/remotesensing/remotesensing6.html#AbdulkarimKH14 https://core.ac.uk/display/25566119 https://doi.org/10.3390/rs6109691 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014RemS....6.9691A/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs6109691,10.3390/rs6109691,2046862850,,0,013-803-494-618-557; 018-663-572-986-479; 023-273-382-773-947; 024-723-379-221-772; 026-645-756-189-301; 037-459-903-141-560; 040-267-517-107-219; 040-345-907-238-389; 052-332-957-250-91X; 053-719-873-020-626; 057-545-918-303-995; 072-595-001-841-272; 075-042-159-995-406; 082-068-003-678-745; 097-612-174-011-049; 128-494-233-211-541; 164-150-313-087-380; 169-004-007-623-620; 171-544-875-588-246,4,,(doi) 10.3390/rs6109691; (coreid) 25566119; (magid) 2046862850,en

They are also a special kind of volunteered geographic information (VGI). VGI data have issues of completeness, which arise from biases caused by the opportunistic nature of the data collection process. We examined the completeness of bird species represented in citizen science observation data from eBird and iNaturalist in US National Parks (NPs). We used approaches for completeness estimation which were developed for data from OpenStreetMap, a crowdsourced map of the world. First, we used an extrinsic approach, comparing species lists from citizen science data with National Park Service lists. Second, we examined two intrinsic approaches using total observation numbers in NPs and the development of the number of new species being added to the data-set over time. Results from the extrinsic approach provided appropriate completeness estimations to evaluate the intrinsic ...",20,1,3,13,Biodiversity; Data collection; Citizen science; Geography; Information retrieval; Data quality; Data science; National park; Observation data; Completeness (statistics); Volunteered geographic information,,,,,https://tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10095020.2017.1288424 https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10095020.2017.1288424,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10095020.2017.1288424,10.1080/10095020.2017.1288424,2591528854,,0,004-445-599-749-605; 009-954-580-739-834; 013-516-235-069-82X; 020-530-734-846-35X; 022-473-450-579-960; 024-723-379-221-772; 028-060-860-303-273; 030-416-570-557-01X; 030-975-962-975-895; 038-976-596-179-447; 045-181-423-237-180; 047-371-444-543-363; 048-963-297-282-954; 057-545-918-303-995; 057-576-853-756-61X; 059-313-507-808-403; 086-758-442-428-039; 121-688-042-151-719; 138-673-529-421-480; 141-404-322-947-920; 146-610-288-526-661; 164-199-543-957-430; 190-216-777-739-959; 191-081-429-399-856,13,,(doi) 10.1080/10095020.2017.1288424; (magid) 2591528854,en

In less than one year, the database “Request a Woman Scientist” comprised over 7,500 women from 174 scientific disciplines and 133 countries. The database is built upon a voluntary questionnaire regarding career stage, degree, scientific discipline, geographic location, and other self-identifying dimensions of representation. The information was visualized using the software platform Tableau, with dropdown menus that help query the database and output a list of names, email addresses, and websites. The biological sciences and women scientists from the United States of America were best represented in the database. A survey of women in the database conducted in November 2018 showed that of 1,278 respondents, 11% had been contacted since signing up for a variety of engagements, including media, peer review, panel participation, educational outreach, and professional/research connections. These engagements resulted in consultations for articles, video chats with students, and speaking opportunities at conferences and events.

If framed in the context of open, transparent and accountable governance then presumably VGI should advance dialogue and consultation between citizen and government. If governments perceive citizens as consumers of services then arguably such democratic intent elide when municipalities use VGI. Our empirical research shows how assumptions embedded in VGI drive the interaction between citizens and government. We created a typology that operationalises VGI as a potential act of citizenship and an instance of consumption. We then selected civic apps from Canadian cities that appeared to invoke these VGI types. We conducted interviews with developers of the apps; they were from government, private sector, and civil society. Results from qualitative semi-structured interviews indicate a blurring of consumer and citizen-centric orientations among respondents, which depended on motivations for data use, engagement and communication objectives, and sector of the respondent. Citizen engagement, an analogue for citizenship, was interpreted multiple ways. Overall, we found that government and developers may increase choice by creating consumer-friendly apps but this does not ensure VGI offers an act of civic participation. The burden is placed on the contributor to make it so. Apps and VGI could potentially further a data-driven and neoliberal government. Planners should be mindful of the dominance of a consumer-centric view even as they assume VGI invariably improves democratic participation.",1,2,141,154,Empirical research; Private sector; Web 2.0; Government; Political science; Civic engagement; Public administration; Corporate governance; Public relations; Civil society; Volunteered geographic information,,,,,https://www.cogitatiopress.com/urbanplanning/article/view/644 https://core.ac.uk/display/87756366 https://ideas.repec.org/a/cog/urbpla/v1y2016i2p141-154.html https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:cog:urbpla:v:1:y:2016:i:2:p:141-154 https://www.cogitatiopress.com/urbanplanning/article/download/644/644 https://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/bitstream/document/54387/1/ssoar-up-2016-2-sangiambut_et_al-The_V_in_VGI_Citizens.pdf https://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/handle/document/54387,http://dx.doi.org/10.17645/up.v1i2.644,10.17645/up.v1i2.644,2473128379,,0,000-199-442-436-874; 001-884-329-358-669; 002-033-358-303-30X; 004-803-133-789-127; 005-443-470-189-456; 007-918-975-903-757; 011-857-737-117-652; 018-633-909-125-205; 020-057-026-751-826; 020-910-316-459-423; 021-281-423-192-063; 027-277-768-551-574; 028-182-557-504-297; 030-437-849-233-701; 032-903-495-847-439; 033-060-042-560-682; 033-493-410-510-114; 041-793-028-069-027; 041-992-481-228-833; 043-308-837-852-645; 048-282-619-896-163; 054-261-690-499-421; 055-531-726-547-530; 057-357-333-577-597; 057-545-918-303-995; 062-743-860-365-672; 066-592-063-480-803; 069-566-524-554-386; 072-243-912-426-29X; 082-811-823-576-339; 084-630-670-678-464; 087-652-291-860-625; 097-111-928-863-139; 122-151-014-222-395; 126-648-069-884-299; 127-513-994-777-210; 142-423-375-397-088; 143-399-389-176-234; 147-539-342-970-008; 151-835-967-463-111; 168-321-638-734-354; 169-004-007-623-620; 172-984-847-249-250; 188-203-909-664-377; 195-019-623-135-107,3,,(doi) 10.17645/up.v1i2.644; (magid) 2473128379,en

Monika Moskal; Wanglin Yan,"<jats:p>This paper presents a collective sensing approach that integrates imperfect Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) obtained through Citizen Science (CS) tree mapping projects with very high resolution (VHR) optical remotely sensed data for low-cost, fine-scale, and accurate mapping of trees in urban orchards. To this end, an individual tree crown (ITC) detection technique utilizing template matching (TM) was developed for extracting urban orchard trees from VHR optical imagery. To provide the training samples for the TM algorithm, remotely sensed VGI about trees including the crowdsourced data about ITC locations and their crown diameters was adopted in this study. A data quality assessment of the proposed approach in the study area demonstrated that the detected trees had a very high degree of completeness (92.7%), a high thematic accuracy (false discovery rate (FDR) = 0.090, false negative rate (FNR) = 0.073, and F1 score (F1) = 0.918), and a fair positional accuracy (root mean square error(RMSE) = 1.02 m). Overall, the proposed approach based on the crowdsourced training samples generally demonstrated a promising ITC detection performance in our pilot project.</jats:p>",10,7,1134,,Template matching; Data quality; Very high resolution; Computer science; Volunteered geographic information; Cartography,,,,,https://iges.or.jp/en/pub/mapping-individual-trees-urban-orchards https://www.iges.or.jp/en/pub/mapping-individual-trees-urban-orchards/en https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/remotesensing/remotesensing10.html#VahidiKJMY18 https://doi.org/10.3390/rs10071134 https://keio.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/mapping-the-individual-trees-in-urban-orchards-by-incorporating-v https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018RemS...10.1134V/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs10071134,10.3390/rs10071134,2884996885,,0,001-117-752-253-058; 002-114-795-512-550; 002-486-965-560-238; 003-851-951-932-634; 004-964-111-884-294; 005-547-785-819-551; 006-419-266-913-984; 006-548-035-543-374; 007-818-384-883-653; 008-109-470-453-742; 008-564-871-746-903; 008-640-584-924-625; 009-284-445-363-360; 009-316-944-047-155; 011-097-981-743-648; 011-288-321-593-463; 013-549-700-555-876; 013-791-070-754-437; 014-224-151-678-275; 014-348-277-735-954; 014-922-728-246-580; 014-973-169-959-305; 015-114-223-280-768; 015-560-638-077-614; 016-065-483-976-348; 016-537-892-157-039; 016-880-509-024-363; 018-656-800-575-239; 019-099-364-387-772; 019-362-199-226-515; 020-132-620-861-048; 020-910-316-459-423; 022-613-483-027-208; 025-539-197-614-264; 026-486-855-742-461; 026-645-756-189-301; 030-646-381-426-452; 031-390-226-385-398; 031-450-942-446-667; 034-856-419-439-496; 035-064-385-424-720; 037-652-032-156-381; 038-100-702-021-293; 038-976-596-179-447; 040-215-238-362-650; 041-658-614-339-032; 041-931-660-960-211; 042-986-808-654-89X; 046-236-031-346-283; 046-768-832-582-152; 047-086-630-002-55X; 048-963-297-282-954; 050-001-391-387-538; 051-439-141-065-651; 051-677-728-163-828; 054-180-634-029-690; 057-069-873-592-580; 057-545-918-303-995; 058-975-833-655-63X; 059-813-324-446-295; 063-680-093-041-394; 064-599-455-824-774; 065-860-013-176-442; 066-109-960-871-158; 068-348-644-402-748; 068-661-609-229-645; 068-687-439-059-350; 068-697-478-564-383; 069-667-785-177-761; 070-972-560-010-625; 073-502-623-194-357; 078-674-627-243-788; 079-117-605-176-945; 079-232-905-814-527; 083-045-814-404-320; 084-549-343-984-271; 085-409-450-119-509; 086-758-442-428-039; 090-690-591-428-450; 092-419-581-430-789; 093-200-687-277-946; 095-122-467-723-862; 096-647-912-692-231; 097-612-174-011-049; 097-824-274-218-324; 100-059-642-277-661; 103-800-642-295-42X; 105-162-490-565-871; 105-707-791-435-728; 106-922-295-646-807; 109-127-216-495-331; 111-901-923-536-480; 116-008-812-846-240; 116-438-570-200-905; 120-417-397-044-612; 121-631-412-520-845; 122-710-217-299-374; 124-180-519-369-654; 125-260-989-963-400; 125-744-572-496-481; 128-630-302-259-009; 129-672-011-124-595; 129-845-712-762-509; 136-423-779-276-71X; 137-449-457-483-97X; 138-665-765-042-423; 140-675-262-231-848; 143-315-609-335-102; 145-350-454-429-564; 147-213-981-170-541; 149-573-711-256-144; 152-033-940-293-927; 158-400-294-926-346; 161-009-342-023-966; 162-962-158-598-316; 167-281-249-736-006; 168-453-915-518-954; 174-002-820-690-465; 175-634-055-249-091; 180-434-506-335-955; 192-123-131-244-80X; 192-871-401-628-98X; 195-695-449-959-752; 199-545-886-615-861,6,,(doi) 10.3390/rs10071134; (magid) 2884996885,en

Contributions include volunteered geographic information (VGI), public information displays, mobility apps to encourage green living, providing open data to immigrant populations, reducing the second-order digital divide, sensing of quality of life, proximity based privacy protection, and spatio-temporal online social media analysis. All doctoral students conducted long-term visits and were embedded in city governments and businesses, to gain experience from multiple perspectives in addition to the researcher and users’ perspective. The projects are situated within three areas: transparency, participation, and collaboration. They took mostly a bottom-up (citizen-centric) approach to (smart) open cities, rather than relying on large IT companies to create smart open cities in a top-down manner. This paper discusses the various contributions to enabling open cities, explains in some detail the Open City Toolkit, and its possible uses and impact on stakeholders. A follow-up doctoral program has been solicited and, if successful, will continue this line of research and will strengthen aspects of privacy, data provenance, and trust, in an effort to improve relations between data (e.g. news) publishers and consumers.&lt;/p&gt;;                     </jats:p>",XLII-4/W8,,61,68,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-xlii-4-w8-61-2018,10.5194/isprs-archives-xlii-4-w8-61-2018,,,0,,2,,(doi) 10.5194/isprs-archives-xlii-4-w8-61-2018,en

However, the dominant influence of natural and socioeconomic factors within a city on PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; is not extensively studied yet. In this study, the Random Forest Regression (RFR) is utilized to quantify the relationships between PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; and potential factors within Wuhan city on a typical day turn from winter to spring. Technically, the 24-hour average PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; concentration in downtown area on February 17th 2017 are collected at 9 sites. In the meantime, we retrieve simultaneous aerosol depth optical depth (AOD) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The ground measured PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; and AOD are coupled for the retrieval of near-surface PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; concentration by Spatial-temporal CoKriging (STCK) with Normalized Vegetation Index (NDVI), Modified Normalized Water Index (MNDWI), Normalized Building Index (NDBI) from Landsat-8 and DEM from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). As the geospatial big data booms, the Internet-collected volunteered geographic information (VGI), representing the urban form and function, are integrating for the regression to obtain the spatial variables importance measures (VIMs) by RFR both in centre and sub-urban region of Wuhan.

This heterogeneity is a curb for map-making, particularly when using traditional map derivation processes such as generalization. This paper proposes a method to infer the LoD of VGI features. Then, inconsistencies between features with different LoDs that get in the way of good map-making can be automatically identified. Some proposals are made to harmonize LoD heterogeneities. The inferring of LoDs is implemented, and results are presented on OpenStreetMap data.; 	 Resume: Il est possible de definir le niveau de detail (NdD) des ensembles de donnees qui font autorite, mais le contraire est vrai dans le cas de l’information geographique fournie volontairement (IGV), souvent caracterisee par des NdD heterogenes.

The main novel contributions go beyond the application domain for which the SDI has been developed and are the following: the ingestion within an a-centric SDI, potentially distributed in several nodes on the Internet to support scalability, of products derived by processing remote sensing images, authoritative data, georeferenced in-situ measurements and voluntary information (VGI) created by farmers and agronomists using an original Smart App; the workflow automation for publishing sets and time series of heterogeneous multisource geospatial data and relative web services; and, finally, the project geoportal, that can ease the analysis of the geospatial datasets and time series by providing complex intelligent spatio-temporal query and answering facilities",5,5,73,,Geoportal; Geospatial PDF; Workflow; Spatial data infrastructure; Geography; Data science; Web service; Volunteered geographic information; Database; Metadata; Geospatial analysis,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ijgi/ijgi5.html#BordognaKFBCSBS16 https://www.mendeley.com/catalogue/b9ab8022-c361-3a41-a908-4b04542ad2fd/ https://core.ac.uk/display/89324177 https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi5050073 http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi5050073 https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/6491058 https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/5/5/73 https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/5/5/73/pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi5050073,10.3390/ijgi5050073,2406074753,,0,001-607-814-616-953; 006-735-299-667-235; 007-174-950-080-53X; 008-132-445-022-591; 008-177-141-477-991; 019-379-838-171-970; 027-839-871-580-332; 035-241-537-153-574; 037-213-022-702-823; 039-908-542-862-357; 040-425-143-762-307; 043-653-751-719-410; 045-987-276-771-510; 048-985-111-349-696; 051-827-185-999-530; 056-461-662-918-579; 057-545-918-303-995; 058-256-969-855-103; 064-594-405-001-304; 073-153-392-950-166; 083-105-419-666-357; 091-653-776-524-418; 097-776-132-818-195; 101-853-476-992-575; 125-511-416-335-910; 131-920-844-366-312; 158-581-589-717-58X; 159-147-291-318-10X; 166-615-109-855-880; 184-750-953-056-018; 193-488-696-001-109,19,,(coreid) 89324177; (doi) 10.3390/ijgi5050073; (magid) 2406074753,en

Foody; Steffen Fritz,"Geo-tagged photographs are used increasingly as a source of Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI), which could potentially be used for land use and land cover applications. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the feasibility of using this source of spatial information for three use cases related to land cover: Calibration, validation and verification.

The emergence of VGI has played an important role in providing timely data when the costs and its availability is a major concern particularly during emergency and humanitarian efforts. The worldwide crowdsourcing efforts through OpenStreetMap (OSM), the most successful open platform for collaborative mapping have managed to assist authorities such as during the 2017 Mexico earthquake and Hurricane Irma and Maria that impacted several countries in America continent. However, there are lots of arguments on the quality of VGI, particularly in regard to OpenStreetMap (OSM). Therefore, this study was carried out to assess the quality of OSM against authoritative sources using a dataset of Putrajaya, Malaysia. This study assessed the quality of OSM, including completeness, positional and thematic accuracy. From the preliminary assessment, the results showed that the OSM data was good in terms of relative positioning accuracy, particularly in road feature, but still poor in terms of completeness and thematic correctness against the reference dataset. This study is significant with an expected contribution to the assessment of quality of VGI in developing countries that commonly facing slow-paced progress in mapping the OSM. The findings could be used as a basis for various parties that plan to use OSM in Malaysia, particularly Putrajaya as a supplementary data to authoritative sources, including data supplied by the professional surveyors.&lt;/p&gt;;                     </jats:p>",XLII-4/W9,,291,298,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-xlii-4-w9-291-2018,10.5194/isprs-archives-xlii-4-w9-291-2018,,,0,,2,,(doi) 10.5194/isprs-archives-xlii-4-w9-291-2018,en; pt

Stein; Peter G. M. van der Heijden; Vincent Buskens; Jim E. van Steenbergen; Linus Bengtsson; Carl E. Koppeschaar; Anna Thorson; Mirjam Kretzschmar,"Background: Transmission of respiratory pathogens in a population depends on the contact network patterns of individuals. To accurately understand and explain epidemic behaviour information on contact networks is required, but only limited empirical data is available. Online respondent-driven detection can provide relevant epidemiological data on numbers of contact persons and dynamics of contacts between pairs of individuals. We aimed to analyse contact networks with respect to sociodemographic and geographical characteristics, vaccine-induced immunity and self-reported symptoms. Methods: In 2014, volunteers from two large participatory surveillance panels in the Netherlands and Belgium were invited for a survey. Participants were asked to record numbers of contacts at different locations and self-reported influenza-like-illness symptoms, and to invite 4 individuals they had met face to face in the preceding 2 weeks. We calculated correlations between linked individuals to investigate mixing patterns. Results: In total 1560 individuals completed the survey who reported in total 30591 contact persons; 488 recruiterrecruit pairs were analysed. Recruitment was assortative by age, education, household size, influenza vaccination status and sentiments, indicating that participants tended to recruit contact persons similar to themselves. We also found assortative recruitment by symptoms, reaffirming our objective of sampling contact persons whom a participant may infect or by whom a participant may get infected in case of an outbreak. Recruitment was random by sex and numbers of contact persons. Relationships between pairs were influenced by the spatial distribution of peer recruitment. Conclusions: Although complex mechanisms influence online peer recruitment, the observed statistical relationships reflected the observed contact network patterns in the general population relevant for the transmission of respiratory pathogens.

174-912-566-158-897,Building Online Academic Community: Reputation Work on Twitter,2017-04-26,2017,journal article,M/C Journal,14412616,Queensland University of Technology,,Hazel Ferguson,"<jats:p>Introduction In an era of upheaval and uncertainty for higher education institutions around the world, scholars, like those in many in other professions, are increasingly using social media to build communities around mutual support and professional development. These communities appear to offer opportunities for participants to exert more positive influence over the types of interactions they engage in with colleagues, in many cases being valued as more altruistic, transformational, or supportive than established academic structures (Gibson, and Gibbs; Mewburn, and Thomson; Maitzen). What has been described as ‘digital scholarship’ applies social media to “different facets of scholarly activity in a helpful and productive way” (Carrigan 5), with online scholarly communities being likened to evolutions of face-to-face practices including peer mentoring (Ferguson, and Wheat) or a “virtual staffroom” (Mewburn, and Thomson). To a large extent, these accounts of scholarly practice adapted for digital media have resonance. From writing groups (O’Dwyer, McDonough, Jefferson, Goff, and Redman-MacLaren) to conference attendance (Spilker, Silva, and Morgado) and funding (Osimo, Priego, and Vuorikari), the transformational possibilities of social media have been applied to almost every facet of existing academic practices. These practices have increasingly attracted scrutiny from higher education institutions, with social media profiles of staff both a potential asset and risk to institutions’ brands. Around the world, institutions use social media for marketing, student recruitment, student support and alumni communication (Palmer). As such, social media policies have emerged in recent years in attempts to ensure staff engage in ways that align with the interests of their employers (Solberg; Carrigan). However, engagement via social media is also still largely considered “supplementary to ‘real’ scholarly work” (Mussell 347).Paralleling this trend, guides to effectively managing an online profile as a component of professional reputation have also become increasingly common (e.g. Carrigan). While public relations and management literatures have approached reputation management in terms of how an organisation is regarded by its multiple stakeholders (Fombrun) this is increasingly being applied to individuals on social media. According to Gandini a “reputation economy” (22) has come to function for knowledge workers who seek to cultivate a reputation as a good community member through sociality in order to secure more (or better) work.The popularity of professional social media communities and scrutiny of participants raises questions about the work involved in building and participating in them. This article explores these questions through analysis of tweets from the first year of #ECRchat, a Twitter group for early career researchers (ECRs). The group was established in 2012 to provide an opportunity for ECRs (typically within five years of PhD completion) to discuss career-related issues. Since it was founded, the group has been administered through partnerships between early career scholars using a Twitter account (@ECRchat) and a blog. Tweets, the posts of 140 characters or fewer, which appear on a user’s profile and in followers’ feeds (Twitter) are organised into a ‘chat’ by participants through the use of the hashtag ‘#ECRchat’. Participants vote on chat topics and take on the role of hosting on a volunteer basis. The explicit career focus of this group provides an ideal case study to explore how work is represented in an online professionally-focused community, in order to reflect on what this might mean for the norms of knowledge work.Digital Labour The impact of Internet Communication Technologies (ICT), including social media, on the lives of workers has long been a source of both concern and hope. Mobile devices, wireless Internet and associated communications software enable increasing numbers of people to take work home. This flexibility has been welcomed as the means by which workers might more successfully access jobs and manage competing commitments (Raja, Imaizumi, Kelly, Narimatsu, and Paradi-Guilford). However, hours worked from home are often unpaid and carry with them a strong likelihood of interfering with rest, recreation and family time (Pocock and Skinner). Melissa Gregg describes this as “presence bleed” (2): the dilutions of focus from everyday activities as workers increasingly use electronic devices to ‘check in’ during non-work time. Moving beyond the limitations of this work-life balance approach, which tends to over-state divisions between employment and other everyday life practices, a growing literature seeks to address work in online environments by analysing the types of labour being practiced, rather than seeing such practices as adjunct to physical workplaces. Responding to claims that digital communication heralds a new age of greater freedom, creativity and democratic participation, this work draws attention to the reliance of such networks on unpaid labour (e.g. Hearn; Hesmondhalgh) with ratings, reviews and relationship maintenance serving business’ economic ends alongside the individual interests which motivate participants. The immaterial, affective, and often precarious labour that has been observed is “simultaneously voluntarily given and unwaged, enjoyed and exploited” (Terranova). This work builds particularly on feminist analysis of work (see McRobbie for a discussion of this), with behind the scenes moderator, convenor, and community builder roles largely female and largely unrecognised, be they activist (Gleeson), creative (Duffy) or consumer (Arcy) groups. For some, this suggests the emergence of a new ‘women’s work’ of affective immaterial labour which goes into building transformational communities (Jarrett). Yet, digital labour has not yet been foregrounded within research into higher education, where it is largely practiced in the messy intersections of employment, unpaid professional development, and leisure. Joyce Goggin argues that convergence of these spheres is a feature of digital labour. Consequently, this article seeks to add a consideration of digital labour, specifically the cultural politics of work that emerge in these spaces, to the literature on digital practices as a translation of existing academic responsibilities online. In the context of widespread concerns over academic workload and job market (Bentley, Coates, Dobson, Goedegebuure, and Meek) and the growing international engagement and impact agenda (Priem, Piwowar, and Hemminger), it raises questions about the implications of these practices. Researching Twitter Communities This article analyses tweets from the publicly available Twitter timeline, containing the hashtag #ECRchat, during scheduled chats, from 1 July 2012 to 31 July 2013 (the first year of operation). Initially, all tweets in this time period were analysed in anonymised form to determine the most commonly mentioned topics during chats. This content analysis removed the most common English language words, such as: the; it; I; and RT (which stands for retweet), which would otherwise appear as top results in almost any content analysis regardless of the community of interest. This was followed by qualitative analysis of tweets, to explore in more depth how important issues were articulated and rationalised within the group. This draws on Catherine Driscoll’s and Melissa Gregg’s idea of “sympathetic online cultural studies” which seeks to explore online communities first and foremost as communities rather than as exemplars of online communications (15-20). Here, a narrative approach was undertaken to analyse how participants curated, made sense of, and explained their own career stories (drawing on Pamphilon). Although I do not claim that participants are representative of all ECRs, or that the ideas given the most attention during chats are representative of the experiences of all participants, representations of work articulated here are suggestive of the kinds of public utterances that were considered reasonable within this open online space. Participants are identified according to the twitter handle and user name they had chosen to use for the chats being analysed. This is because the practical infeasibility of guaranteeing online anonymity (readers need only to Google the text of any tweet to associate it with a particular user, in most cases) and the importance of actively involving participants as agents in the research process, in part by identifying them as authors of their own stories, rather than informants (e.g. Butz; Evans; Svalastog and Eriksson).Representations of Work in #ECRchat The co-creation of the #ECRchat community through participant hosts and community votes on chat topics gave rise to a discussion group that was heavily focused on ‘the work’ of academia, including its importance in the lives of participants, relative appeal over other options, and negative effects on leisure time. I was clear that participants regarded participation as serving their professional interests, despite participation not being paid or formally recognised by employers. With the exception of two discussions focused on making decisions about the future of the group, #ECRchat discussions during the year of analysis focused on topics designed to help participants succeed at work such as “career progression and planning”, “different routes to postdoc funding”, and “collaboration”. At a micro-level, ‘work’ (and related terms) was the most frequently used term in #ECRchat, with its total number of uses (1372) almost double that of research (700), the next most used term. Comments during the chats reiterated this emphasis: “It’s all about the work. Be decent to people and jump through the hoops you need to, but always keep your eyes on the work” (Magennis).The depth of participants’ commitment comes through strongly in discussions comparing academic work with other options: “pretty much everyone I know with ‘real jobs’ hates their work. I feel truly lucky to say that I love mine #ECRchat” (McGettigan). This was seen in particular in the discussion about ‘careers outside academia’. Hashtags such as #altac (referring to alternative-academic careers such as university research support or learning and teaching administration roles) and #postac (referring to PhD holders working outside of universities in research or non-research roles) used both alongside the #ECRchat hashtag and separately, provide an ongoing site of these kinds of representations. While participants in #ECRchat sought to shift this perception and were critically aware that it could lead to undesirable outcomes: “PhDs and ECRs in Humanities don’t seem to consider working outside of academia – that limits their engagement with training #ECRchat” (Faculty of Humanities at the University of Manchester), such discussions frequently describe alternative academic careers as a ‘backup plan’, should academic employment not be found. Additionally, many participants suggested that their working hours were excessive, extending the professional into personal spaces and times in ways that they did not see as positive. This was often described as the only way to achieve success: “I hate to say it, but one of the best ways to improve track record is to work 70+ hours a week, every week. Forever. #ecrchat” (Dunn). One of the key examples of this dynamic was the scheduling of the chat itself. When founded in 2012, #ECRchat ran in the Australian evening and UK morning, eliding the personal/work distinction for both its coordinators and participants. While considerable discussion was concerned with scheduling the chat during times when a large number of international participants could attend, this discussion centred on waking rather than working hours. The use of scheduled tweets and shared work between convenors in different time zones (Australia and the United Kingdom) maintained an around the clock online presence, extending well beyond the ordinary working hours of any individual participant.Personal Disclosure The norms that were articulated in #ECRchat are perhaps not surprising for a group of participants seeking to establish themselves in a profession where a long-hours culture and work-life interference are common (Bentley, Coates, Dobson, Goedegebuure, and Meek). However, what is notable is that participation frequently involved the extension of the personal into the professional and in support of professional aims. In the chat’s first year, an element of personal disclosure and support for others became key to acting as a good community member. Beyond the well-established norms of white collar workers demonstrating professionalism by deploying “courtesy, helpfulness, and kindness” (Mills xvii), this community building relied on personal disclosure which to some extent collapsed personal and professional boundaries.By disclosing individual struggles, anxieties, and past experiences participants contributed to a culture of support. This largely functioned through discussions of work stress rather than leisure: “I definitely don’t have [work-life balance]. I think it’s because I don’t have a routine so work and home constantly blend into one another” (Feely). Arising from these discussions, ideas to help participants better navigate and build academic careers was one of the main ways this community support and concern was practiced: “I think I’m often more productive and less anxious if I'm working on a couple of things in parallel, too #ecrchat” (Brian).Activities such as preparing meals, caring for family, and leisure activities, became part of the discussion. “@snarkyphd Sorry, late, had to deal with toddler. Also new; currently doing casual teaching/industry work &amp; applying for postdocs #ecrchat” (Ronald). Exclusively professional profiles were considered less engaging than the combination of personal and professional that most participants adopted: “@jeanmadams I’ve answered a few queries on ResearchGate, but agree lack of non-work opinions / personality makes them dull #ecrchat” (Tennant). However, this is not to suggest that these networks become indistinguishable from more informal, personal, or leisurely uses of social media: “@networkedres My ‘professional’ online identity is slightly more guarded than my ‘facebook’ id which is for friends and family #ECRchat” (Wheat). Instead, disclosure of certain kinds of work struggles came to function as a positive contribution to a more reflexive professionalism. In the context of work-focused discussion, #ECRchat opens important spaces for scholars to question norms they considered damaging or at least make these tacit norms explicit and receive support to manage them. Affective Labour The professional goals and focus of #ECRchat, combined with the personal support and disclosure that forms the basis for the supportive elements in this group is arguably one of its strongest and most important elements. Mark Carrigan suggests that the practices of revealing something of the struggles we experience could form the basis for a new collegiality, where common experiences which had previously not been discussed publicly are for the first time recognised as systemic, not individual challenges. However, there is work required to provide context and support for these emotional experiences which is largely invisible here, as has typically been the case in other communities. Such ‘affective labour’ “involves the production and manipulation of affect and requires (virtual or actual) human contact, labour in the bodily mode … the labour is immaterial, even if it is corporeal and affective, in the sense that its products are intangible, a feeling of ease, well-being, satisfaction, excitement or passion” (Hardt, and Negri 292). In #ECRchat, this ranges from managing the schedule and organising discussions – which involves following up offers to help, assisting people to understand the task, and then ensuring things go ahead as planned –to support offered by members of the group within discussions. This occurs in the overlaps between personal and professional representations, taking a variety of forms from everyday reassurance, affirmation, and patience: “Sorry to hear - hang in there. Hope you have a good support network. #ECRchat” (Galea) to empathy often articulated alongside the disclosure discussed earlier: “The feeling of guilt over not working sounds VERY familiar! #ecrchat” (Vredeveldt).The point here is not to suggest that this work is not sufficiently valued by participants, or that it does not parallel the kinds of work undertaken in more formal job roles, including in academia, where management, conference convening or participation in professional societies, and teaching, as just a few examples, involve degrees of affective labour. However, as a consequence of the (semi)public nature of these groups, the interactions observed here appear to represent a new inflection of professional reputation work, where, in building online professional communities, individuals peg their professional reputations to these forms of affective labour. Importantly, given the explicitly professional nature of the group, these efforts are not counted as part of the formal workload of those involved, be they employed (temporarily or more securely) inside or outside universities, or not in the paid workforce.  Conclusion A growing body of literature demonstrates that online academic communities can provide opportunities for collegiality, professional development, and support: particularly among emerging scholars. These accounts demonstrate the value of digital scholarly practices across a range of academic work. However, this article’s discussion of the work undertaken to build and maintain #ECRchat in its first year suggests that these practices at the messy intersections of employment, unpaid professional development, and leisure constitute a new inflection of professional reputation and service work. This work involves publicly building a reputation as a good community member through a combination of personal disclosure and affective labour.In the context of growing emphasis on the economic, social, and other impacts of academic research and concerns over work intensification, this raises questions about possible scope for, and impact of, formal recognition of digital academic labour. While institutions’ work planning and promotion processes may provide opportunities to recognise work developing professional societies or conferences as a leadership or service to a discipline, this new digital service work remains outside the purview of such recognition and reward systems. Further research into the relationships between academic reputation and digital labour will be needed to explore the implications of this for institutions and academics alike.  AcknowledgementsI would like to gratefully acknowledge the contributions and support of everyone who participated in developing and sustaining #ECRchat.

It is important to evaluate the validity of user-generated content for use in research or program planning. The purpose of this study was to test whether the aggregated environmental (“bikeability”) ratings from novice community residents converges with ratings from experts using a robust research-based, paper audit-tool (the established Pedestrian Environment Data Scan (PEDS) tool). Equivalence testing statistically showed overall agreement between the composite ratings of bikeability within the novice group. Agreement in categorical ratings between novices and experts were examined using the summary agreement index, which showed substantial agreement across the 10 locations rated by 11 novices using an f-VGI mobile application and four experts using PEDS; variability depended on the nature of the specific questions asked. Results reveal overall substantial agreement between novice and expert ratings for both composite scores and individual categorical ratings.

Due to climate changes, wildfire breakouts get more frequent and difficult to control. In the mid-July 2017, the wildfire spread from wildland to the city of Split, the second-largest city in Croatia. This unpredictable spread almost caused the collapse of emergency response systems. Fortunately, a greater tragedy was avoided with the composure of the responsible services and the help of the citizens. The citizens helped in extinguishing the fire and timely provided the significant amount of disaster-related information on different platforms and through social media. In this paper, we address the problem of identifying useful Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) and georeferenced social media, for improving situation awareness while the wildfire was reaching the Croatian city of Split. Additionally, we combine social media with other external data sources (e. g. Sentinel-2 satellite images) and authoritative data (e.g. Croatian National Protection and Rescue Directorate official data and Public Fire Department of Split data) to establish the geographical relations between the wildfire phenomena and social media messages. In this manner, we seek to leverage the existing knowledge and data about the spatiotemporal characteristics of the Split wildfire in order to improve the identification of useful information from georeferenced social media with other integrated data sources that can be valuable for improving situation awareness in wildfire events.",XLII-3/W8,,415,420,Climate change; Situation awareness; Geography; Crisis mapping; Social media; Volunteered geographic information; Georeference; Leverage (finance); Croatian; Environmental planning,,,,,https://www.bib.irb.hr/1019023 https://noa.gwlb.de/receive/cop_mods_00000236 https://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/XLII-3-W8/415/2019/isprs-archives-XLII-3-W8-415-2019.pdf https://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/XLII-3-W8/415/2019/,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-xlii-3-w8-415-2019,10.5194/isprs-archives-xlii-3-w8-415-2019,2971271738,,0,,1,,(doi) 10.5194/isprs-archives-xlii-3-w8-415-2019; (magid) 2971271738,en

Policies related to the location of aid posts are important decisions. The facts show that there are many failures in the process of providing assistance to the refugees due to lack of preparation and determination of facilities and aid post location. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the number and location of aid posts on Merapi eruption in 2010. This study uses an integration between Agent Based Modeling (ABM) and Geographic Information System (GIS) about evaluation of the number and location of the aid post using some scenarios. The ABM approach aims to describe the agents behaviour (refugees and volunteers) in the event of a disaster with their respective characteristics.

Shakeri; Abbas Alimohammadi; Abolghasem Sadeghi-Niaraki; Ali Asghar Alesheikh,"Spatial data is one of the most critical elements underpinning decision making for many disciplines. Accessing and sharing spatial data have always been a great struggle for researchers. Spatial data infrastructure (SDI) plays a key role in spatial data sharing by building a suitable platform for collaboration and cooperation among the different data producer organizations. In recent years, SDI vision has been moved toward a user-centric platform which has led to development of a new and enriched generation of SDI (third generation). This vision is to provide an environment where users can cooperate to handle spatial data in an effective and satisfactory way. User-centric SDI concentrates on users, their requirements and preferences while in the past, SDI initiatives were mainly concentrated on technological issues such as the data harmonization, standardized metadata models, standardized web services for data discovery, visualization and download. On the other hand, new technologies such as the GPS-equipped smart phones, navigation devices and Web 2.0 technologies have enabled citizens to actively participate in production and sharing of the spatial information. This has led to emergence of the new phenomenon called the Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI). VGI describes any type of content that has a geographic element which has been voluntarily collected. However, its distinctive element is the geographic information that can be collected and produced by citizens with different formal expertise and knowledge of the spatial or geographical concepts. Therefore, ordinary citizens can cooperate in providing massive sources of information that cannot be ignored. These can be considered as the valuable spatial information sources in SDI. These sources can be used for completing, improving and updating of the existing databases. Spatial information and technologies are an important part of the transportation systems. Planning, design and operation of the transportation systems requires the exchange of large volumes of spatial data and often close cooperation among the various organizations. However, there is no technical and organizational process to get a suitable data infrastructure to address diverse needs of the transportation. Hence, development of a common standards and a simple data exchange mechanism is strongly needed in the field of transportation for decision support. Since one of the main purposes of transportation projects is to improve the quality of services provided to users, it is necessary to involve the users themselves in the decision making processes. This should be done through a public participation and involvement in all stages of the transportation projects. In other words, using public knowledge and information as another source of information is very important to make better and more efficient decisions. Public participation in transportation projects can also help organizations to enhance their public supports; because the lack of public support can lead to failure of technically valid projects. However, due to complexity of the transportation tasks, lack of appropriate environment and methods for facilitation of the public participation, collection and analysis of the public information and opinions, public participation in this field has not been well considered so far. This paper reviews the previous researches based on the enriched SDI development and its movement toward the VGI by focusing on the public participation in transportation projects. To this end, methods and models that have been used in previous researches are studied and classified initially. Then, methods of the previous researchers on VGI and transportation are conceptualized in SDI. Finally, the suggested method for transportation projects is presented. Results indicate success of the new generation of SDI in integration with public participation for transportation projects.",XL-1/W3,,383,388,Decision support system; Engineering; Data exchange; Spatial data infrastructure; Emerging technologies; Data discovery; Public participation; Web service; Knowledge management; Volunteered geographic information,,,,,http://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/XL-1-W3/383/2013/ http://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/XL-1-W3/383/2013/isprsarchives-XL-1-W3-383-2013.pdf http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ISPAr.XL1c.383S/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/isprsarchives-xl-1-w3-383-2013,10.5194/isprsarchives-xl-1-w3-383-2013,2115278869,,0,004-396-522-659-38X; 005-669-433-207-16X; 006-275-746-969-733; 006-367-037-732-010; 019-081-938-014-866; 021-074-586-154-668; 032-903-495-847-439; 032-952-859-239-890; 033-327-667-328-795; 056-286-853-695-050; 066-128-338-043-823; 068-178-280-090-210; 086-836-249-654-692; 088-431-364-816-236; 089-407-448-652-108; 090-193-536-345-794; 105-203-436-246-544; 109-346-228-648-358; 120-651-905-310-08X; 131-356-259-197-779; 157-809-313-546-347; 157-890-855-028-756; 166-615-109-855-880; 168-321-638-734-354,1,,(doi) 10.5194/isprsarchives-xl-1-w3-383-2013; (magid) 2115278869; (coreid) 91852513,en

The ubiquitous usage of location-enabled devices, such as smartphones, allows contributors to share their geographic information on a number of selected online portals. The collected information is oftentimes referred to as volunteered geographic information (VGI). One of the most utilized, analyzed and cited VGI-platforms, with an increasing popularity over the past few years, is OpenStreetMap (OSM), whose main goal it is to create a freely available geographic database of the world. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the latest developments in VGI research, focusing on its collaboratively collected geodata and corresponding contributor patterns. Additionally, trends in the realm of OSM research are discussed, highlighting which aspects need to be investigated more closely in the near future.",6,1,76,106,User-generated content; The Internet; World Wide Web; Realm; Popularity; Geographic database; Computer science; Volunteered geographic information,,,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1999-5903/6/1/76 https://doi.org/10.3390/fi6010076 https://www.mdpi.com/1999-5903/6/1/76/pdf https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fi6010076 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/fi/fi6.html#NeisZ14 https://core.ac.uk/display/26908494 http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fi6010076 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/26908494.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fi6010076,10.3390/fi6010076,2110152355,,0,000-641-153-487-578; 002-033-358-303-30X; 003-090-922-851-313; 003-758-424-621-002; 004-445-599-749-605; 006-057-019-890-636; 007-684-128-166-136; 008-655-662-451-459; 008-714-358-699-609; 010-024-340-417-726; 010-235-999-789-747; 010-499-544-891-744; 014-015-773-862-332; 014-818-480-999-908; 015-547-304-212-023; 017-194-800-561-718; 017-518-735-691-484; 020-749-054-636-988; 021-030-473-051-086; 021-041-484-242-674; 022-473-450-579-960; 022-816-728-271-154; 023-290-850-444-285; 024-033-783-358-131; 024-403-212-152-856; 026-645-756-189-301; 027-736-997-184-595; 028-739-825-417-25X; 029-963-409-674-751; 029-965-425-507-24X; 030-217-575-405-566; 031-693-310-151-111; 035-673-137-692-199; 038-473-615-096-985; 038-976-596-179-447; 040-074-008-666-417; 040-184-564-272-635; 040-267-517-107-219; 040-308-597-328-326; 042-251-963-818-156; 048-702-561-381-148; 049-169-102-357-871; 052-551-648-887-490; 057-545-918-303-995; 059-166-368-738-830; 060-469-284-268-556; 061-495-515-807-162; 061-905-706-074-765; 062-988-018-429-430; 066-101-498-522-68X; 071-137-895-384-626; 072-243-912-426-29X; 074-553-217-053-432; 078-519-916-913-653; 081-913-864-796-435; 085-221-214-334-157; 088-339-711-439-200; 089-782-469-573-067; 090-289-954-298-114; 090-583-223-848-650; 093-372-586-597-116; 094-466-886-510-151; 097-338-432-344-323; 097-612-174-011-049; 097-773-332-306-457; 098-565-405-790-308; 100-120-230-982-09X; 100-866-038-545-202; 101-730-056-244-941; 102-160-469-693-977; 103-859-285-040-344; 104-292-627-025-008; 106-264-944-278-433; 106-919-166-865-846; 111-163-933-663-414; 111-811-300-036-763; 112-325-364-706-730; 117-900-767-404-155; 118-057-611-878-127; 118-490-814-259-358; 119-300-636-758-248; 120-348-450-238-234; 124-043-027-110-303; 126-633-662-228-071; 138-847-225-776-212; 139-982-470-639-017; 141-966-724-682-069; 144-096-391-736-702; 144-457-531-346-978; 145-350-454-429-564; 147-876-713-700-216; 149-278-345-008-041; 158-847-532-778-731; 169-004-007-623-620; 170-332-054-871-14X; 170-767-348-108-054; 171-529-797-595-110; 171-544-875-588-246; 185-700-850-296-212; 191-022-751-288-572; 195-019-623-135-107,156,,(doi) 10.3390/fi6010076; (magid) 2110152355; (coreid) 26908494,en

A. Brovelli; G. Zamboni,"<jats:p>Abstract. GeoWeb 2.0, the geographic extension of Web 2.0, has opened new possibilities in terms of online dissemination and sharing of geospatial contents, thus laying the foundations for a fruitful development of Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) systems. At the same time the technological evolution and the availability of ever more efficient devices has allowed the usability of the third dimension even for the cartographic viewers, changing the way people approach to geographic information on the Web. Unlike the traditional 2D-visualization typical of the classic Web Geographic Information Systems (Web-GISs), the multi-dimensional viewers, of which virtual globes are the main examples, offer fully-realistic content visualization which allows for a much richer user experience. In this paper a 3D Web application based on the NASA World Wind virtual globe which aims at the enhancement of the foot paths on the hilly cross-border area between Italy and Switzerland is presented.;                     </jats:p>",XL-4/W7,,23,30,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/isprsarchives-xl-4-w7-23-2015,10.5194/isprsarchives-xl-4-w7-23-2015,,,0,,1,,(doi) 10.5194/isprsarchives-xl-4-w7-23-2015; (coreid) 91957031,en
