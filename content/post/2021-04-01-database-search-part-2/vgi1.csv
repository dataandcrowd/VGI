Although gentrification is first and foremost a residential process, it also entails commercial redevelopment. As the socioeconomic composition of the neighborhood changes, so it does the perception of acceptable land uses. In Soho, displacement has affect residents and local business in the same way, but the attention has been focused in the cultural and entertainment activities that have been currently disappearing, since once they were the heart of this neighborhood. The principal aim of this study is to develop a methodology to keep geographic land-use databases updated in order to analyze the spatial variability related with gentrification process of Soho. This study shows a methodology to keep geographic land-use database updated using Geographic Information Systems, through the use of panoramic photos captured by Google Street View. Since the panoramic photos from different years are now available, Google Street View could become a new tool to perceive, observe and study neighborhood changes in Soho during the years 2008, 2012, 2014 and 2015. Based on the obtained maps, there is a representative spatial variability that land uses show in Soho, as regardless the reduced extension of this area, the centroids are constantly moving from year to year. Therefore, Geographic Information Systems and Google Street View are useful tools to keep updated geodatabases; however, for future work it is recommended the inclusion of Volunteered Geographic Information.",15,17,1,1,"Land use, land-use change and forestry; Socioeconomic status; Regional science; Geography; Gentrification; Redevelopment; Geographic information system; Land use; Entertainment; Volunteered geographic information",,10.19044/esj.2019.v15n17p1,2956159135

SOLAP systems are already used in the context of natural hazards for analyzing sensor data and experts' measurements. Recently, new data gathering tools coined as volunteered geographic information systems (VGI) have been adopted especially by non-expert users. Hence, (spatial) application development is facing a new challenge, which is the integration of expert-oriented data with citizen-provided data.

Davis; Rafael Odon de Alencar,"Geocoding urban addresses usually requires the use of an underlying address database. Under the influence of the format defined for TIGER files decades ago, most address databases and street geocoding algorithms are organized around street centerlines, associating numbering ranges to thoroughfare segments between two street crossings. While this method has been successfully employed in the USA for a long time, its transposition to other countries may lead to increased errors. This article presents an evaluation of the centerline-geocoding resources provided by Google Maps, as compared to the point-geocoding method used in the city of Belo Horizonte, Brazil, which we took as a baseline. We generated a textual address for each point object found in the city's point-based address database, and submitted it to the Google Maps geocoding API. We then compared the resulting coordinates with the ones recorded in Belo Horizonte's GIS. We demonstrate that the centerline segment interpolation method, employed by the online resources following the American practice, has problems that can considerably influence the quality of the geocoding outcome. Completeness and accuracy have been found to be irregular, especially within lower income areas. Such errors in online services can have a significant impact on geocoding efforts related to social applications, such as public health and education, since the online service can be faulty and error-prone in the most socially demanding areas of the city. In the conclusion, we point out that a volunteered geographic information (VGI) approach can help with the enrichment and enhancement of current geocoding resources, and can possibly lead to their transformation into more reliable point-based geocoding services.",15,6,851,868,Numbering; Geography; Data science; Point object; Lower income; Geocoding; Volunteered geographic information; Cartography,,10.1111/j.1467-9671.2011.01288.x,1921424391

Leibovici; Julian F. Rosser; Crona Hodges; Barry Evans; Mike Jackson; Chris Higgins,"Volunteer geographical information (VGI), either in the context of citizen science or the mining of social media, has proven to be useful in various domains including natural hazards, health status, disease epidemics, and biological monitoring. Nonetheless, the variable or unknown data quality due to crowdsourcing settings are still an obstacle for fully integrating these data sources in environmental studies and potentially in policy making. The data curation process, in which a quality assurance (QA) is needed, is often driven by the direct usability of the data collected within a data conflation process or data fusion (DCDF), combining the crowdsourced data into one view, using potentially other data sources as well. Looking at current practices in VGI data quality and using two examples, namely land cover validation and inundation extent estimation, this paper discusses the close links between QA and DCDF. It aims to help in deciding whether a disentanglement can be possible, whether beneficial or not, in understanding the data curation process with respect to its methodology for future usage of crowdsourced data. Analysing situations throughout the data curation process where and when entanglement between QA and DCDF occur, the paper explores the various facets of VGI data capture, as well as data quality assessment and purposes. Far from rejecting the usability ISO quality criterion, the paper advocates for a decoupling of the QA process and the DCDF step as much as possible while still integrating them within an approach analogous to a Bayesian paradigm",6,3,78,,Automatic identification and data capture; Quality assurance; Conflation; Usability; Geography; Data quality; Data science; Volunteered geographic information; Crowdsourcing; Data curation,,10.3390/ijgi6030078,2595779829

This article starts by briefly presenting a social-technical model of trust and then moves on with establishing authors rational that interconnects trust with technological-mediated social participation. It continues by linking the trust value to the context of design critique and critical design, and ends by illustrating how to incorporate the trust value into design.

Research has proven that the resulting data in some areas are of decent quality, which guarantees their usability in various applications. Though these achievements are normally attributed to the huge heterogeneous community mainly consisting of amateurs, it is in fact a small percentage of major contributors who make nearly all contributions. In this paper, we investigate the contributing behaviors of these contributors to deduce whether they are actually professionals. Various indicators are used to depict the behaviors on three themes: practice, skill and motivation, aiming to identify solid evidence for expertise. Our case studies show that most major contributors in Germany, France and the United Kingdom are hardly amateurs, but are professionals instead. These contributors have rich experiences on geographical data editing, have a decent grasp of professional software and work on the project with enthusiasm and concentration.

A massively popular augmented reality game, Pokémon GO, recently adopted OSM data for its in-game map and many of its in-game mechanics. This study investigated: (1) How Pokémon GO affected the quantity of daily contributors and daily edits to OSM in South Korea (the only country where OSM data was used exclusively since the game’s launch); and (2) How the game affected volunteers’ contribution habits. The main findings were: (i) the number of daily contributors and daily edits both increased by more than 17 times following the launch of Pokémon GO in South Korea, but returned to more normal levels after around 1&amp;amp;frac12; months; (ii) Most individuals contributing to OSM because of Pokémon GO reportedly did so to improve the in-game map appearance and in-game mechanics; and (iii) Individuals motivated to contribute to OSM because of Pokémon GO tended to create/edit OSM “park” and “water body” features more than other OSM contributors. It is notable that the large increases in OSM contributors and edits occurred even in the absence of any formal guidance or encouragement by the game operator or other parties. If greater efforts are made to encourage participation in VGI initiatives linked to AR games, the observed impacts will likely be even more dramatic.&lt;/p&gt;;                     </jats:p>",2,,54,4,Internet privacy; Sociology; Augmented reality; Water body; Volunteered geographic information,,10.5194/ica-proc-2-54-2019,2958909673

Ostermann,"Abstract Several studies show the impacts of (geo)social media and Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) during crisis events, and have found intrinsic value for rescue teams, relief workers and humanitarian assistance coordinators, as well as the affected population. The main challenge is how emergency management and the public can capitalize on the abundance of this new source of information by reducing the volume to credible and relevant content. In this paper, we present the GeoCONAVI (Geographic CONtext Analysis for Volunteered Information) approach and a prototype system, designed to retrieve, process, analyze and evaluate social media content on forest fires, producing relevant, credible and actionable VGI usable for crisis events. The novelty of the approach lies in the enrichment of the content with additional geographic context information, and use of spatio-temporal clustering to support scoring and validation. Thus, the system is focusing on integrating authoritative data sources with VGI. Evaluation in case studies shows that the prototype system can handle large amounts of data with common-off-the-shelf hardware, produces valuable results, and is adaptable to other types of crisis events.",43,,36,44,World Wide Web; Geography; Data science; Novelty; USable; Population; Social media; Context analysis; Volunteered geographic information; Emergency management; Cluster analysis,,10.1016/j.apgeog.2013.05.005,2053746181

The example used herein is the measurement of personal exposure to traffic pollution, which may be considered as a function of the concentration of pollutants in the air and the frequency and volume of that air which enters our lungs. The sensor-based approach described in this paper removes the 'traditional' requirements either to model or interpolate pollution levels or to make assumptions about the physiology of an individual. Rather, a wholly empirical analysis into pollution exposure is possible, based upon high-resolution spatio-temporal data drawn from sensors for NO<sub>2</sub>, nasal airflow and location (GPS). Data are collected via a custom smartphone application and mapped to give an unprecedented insight into exposure to traffic pollution at the individual level. Whilst the quality of data from low-cost miniaturised sensors is not suitable for all applications, there certainly are many applications for which these data would be well suited, particularly those in the field of citizen science.

Urban sprawl is the main cause of many environmental issues, in tight connection with pollution and loss of biodiversity. One of the main consequences is a decrease of the ecosystem services provided by the urban green infrastructure. However, the extent of urban sprawl is spatially uneven due to the spatial structure of human settlements. Among the methods used to pinpoint sprawl, fractal analyses have a good potential for analyzing fragmentation, especially if used in conjunction with statistical methods. This study aimed to assess, in an exploratory perspective, the level of fragmentation in the Romanian cities covered by the Urban Atlas data, and determine its correlation with parameters related to their demographical and physical characteristics. In addition, taxonomical analyses were used to find whether cities or specific components of the green infrastructure can be grouped. The results did not reveal a general trend, although it seems that the green infrastructure consisted of agricultural/ semi-natural/ wetland areas, forests, green areas, sports and leisure facilities and water bodies in all of them, in different shares; with respect to their distribution, the numerical taxonomy analysis indicated that they form classes matching the types of ‘nature in the city’ previously described by ecologists, despite the particular historical evolution of each city and its particular influence on urban planning. The correlation analysis revealed that the population and its density and the share of the green infrastructure within the total area are significantly correlated with most fractal parameters. Similarly, the fractal dimension of the area, computed using Interactive Quantitative Morphology, seems to correlate with most morphological parameters. However, the taxonomical analysis of cities did not find very relevant groups due to the fact that many large Romanian cities lack Urban Atlas data. The results suggest that the degree of urban fragmentation is correlated especially with the population of cities and its density, reclaiming planning measures aimed at controlling the densification processes (sprawl, gentrification, location of specific activities etc.)",32,,110,123,Human settlement; Ecology; Geography; Economic geography; Gentrification; Green infrastructure; Urban forestry; Population; Urban sprawl; Urban planning; Ecosystem services,,10.1016/j.proenv.2016.03.016,2304097693

Although cyclist’s perceptions must also be critically reviewed, such crowdsourced Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) provides wide-ranging insights on diverse hazard categories in cycling. In this case study in the city of Freiburg, Germany, hazard perceptions, information about lane types, and the underlying routes were crowdsourced via an open source smartphone application by a small group with the aim of providing cyclists with effective solutions. By dealing with levels of reliability, we show that even a small group of laypersons can generate an extensive and valuable set of VGI consisting of comprehensive hazard categories. We demonstrate that (1) certain hazards are interlinked to specific lane types, and (2) the individual hazard perceptions and objective parameters, i.e., accident data, are often congruent spatially; consequently, (3) dangerous hot spots can be derived.

Poore; Eric B. Wolf,"The Internet has brought many changes to the way geographic information is created and shared. One aspect that has not changed is metadata. Static spatial data quality descriptions were standardized in the mid-1990s and cannot accommodate the current climate of data creation where nonexperts are using mobile phones and other location-based devices on a continuous basis to contribute data to Internet mapping platforms. The usability of standard geospatial metadata is being questioned by academics and neogeographers alike. This chapter analyzes current discussions of metadata to demonstrate how the media shift that is occurring has affected requirements for metadata. Two case studies of metadata use are presented—online sharing of environmental information through a regional spatial data infrastructure in the early 2000s, and new types of metadata that are being used today in OpenStreetMap, a map of the world created entirely by volunteers. Changes in metadata requirements are examined for usability, the ease with which metadata supports coproduction of data by communities of users, how metadata enhances findability, and how the relationship between metadata and data has changed. We argue that traditional metadata associated with spatial data infrastructures is inadequate and suggest several research avenues to make this type of metadata more interactive and effective in the GeoWeb.",,,43,64,World Wide Web; Findability; Usability; Spatial data infrastructure; Geospatial metadata; Geoweb; Computer science; Volunteered geographic information; Metadata; Geospatial analysis,,10.1007/978-94-007-4587-2_4,226677948

Rice; Ahmad O. Aburizaiza; R. Daniel Jacobson; Brandon M. Shore; Fabiana I Paez,"Disabled people, especially the blind and vision-impaired, are challenged by many transitory hazards in urban environments such as construction barricades, temporary fencing across walkways, and obstacles along curbs. These hazards present a problem for navigation, because they typically appear in an unplanned manner and are seldom included in databases used for accessibility mapping. Tactile maps are a traditional tool used by blind and vision-impaired people for navigation through urban environments, but such maps are not automatically updated with transitory hazards. As an alternative approach to static content on tactile maps, we use volunteered geographic information (VGI) and an Open Source system to provide updates of local infrastructure. These VGI updates, contributed via voice, text message, and e-mail, use geographic descriptions containing place names to describe changes to the local environment. After they have been contributed and stored in a database, we georeference VGI updates with a detailed gazetteer of local place names including buildings, administrative offices, landmarks, roadways, and dormitories. We publish maps and alerts showing transitory hazards, including location-based alerts delivered to mobile devices. Our system is built with several technologies including PHP, JavaScript, AJAX, Google Maps API, PostgreSQL, an Open Source database, and PostGIS, the PostgreSQL's spatial extension.

This increase is the result of rapid advancements in technology, such as the availability of handheld Global Positioning System (GPS) devices, including on phones (Burke et al., 2006, Long and Nelson, 2013, Schipperijn et al., 2014), combined with the popularity of posting the resulting data on social media and user shared websites (Ghermandi, 2016, Santos et al., 2016). People often upload data, either through websites or applications, to calculate the distance they have travelled and/or to share with others where they have been and what they have been doing. Such publicly available volunteered geographic information can now be used to assess people's movements across landscapes (Heikinheimo et al., 2017). As a result, the data is increasingly used in urban planning, public health and other areas (Hirsch et al., 2014, Kasemsuppakorn and Karimi, 2013, Long and Nelson, 2013), including monitoring park use in a range of settings (Beeco and Brown, 2013, Campelo and Mendes, 2016, Korpilo et al., 2017, Orsi and Geneletti, 2013, Orsi et al., 2013, Santos et al., 2016, Sessions et al., 2016).",89,,163,172,Internet privacy; Mobile device; Geography; Popularity; Urban planning; Social media; Volunteered geographic information; Global Positioning System; Upload; Human geography,,10.1016/j.apgeog.2017.11.001,2771386401

The increasing number of users and their growing demand for high actuality of the topographic data sets motivates the Dutch Kadaster to innovate and improve the Topographical Key Register (BRT). One of the initiatives was to provide a voluntary geographical information project aiming at providing a user-friendly feedback system adjusted to all kinds of user groups. The feedback system is a compulsory element of the Topographical Key Register in the Netherlands. The Dutch Kadaster is obliged to deliver a feedback system and the key-users are obliged to use it. The aim of the feedback system is to improve the quality and stimulate the usage of the data. The results of the pilot shows that the user-friendly and open to everyone feedback system contributes enormously to improve the quality of the topographic dataset.;                     </jats:p>,XL-3/W3,,51,54,Data mining; Geography; Data science; Open data; User group; Topographic map; Volunteered geographic information; Data set; Crowdsourcing,,10.5194/isprsarchives-xl-3-w3-51-2015,2298089010

However, these applications and quality assessments are generally focused on images associated with geolocation through textual annotations, which is only part of valid images to them. In this paper, we explore the distribution pattern for most relevant VGI images of specific landmarks to extend the current quality analysis, and to provide guidance for improving the data-retrieval process of geographic applications. Distribution is explored in terms of two aspects, namely, semantic distribution and spatial distribution. In this paper, the term semantic distribution is used to describe the matching of building-image tags and content with each other. There are three kinds of images (semantic-relevant and content-relevant, semantic-relevant but content-irrelevant, and semantic-irrelevant but content-relevant). Spatial distribution shows how relevant images are distributed around a landmark. The process of this work can be divided into three parts: data filtering, retrieval of relevant landmark images, and distribution analysis. For semantic distribution, statistical results show that an average of 60% of images tagged with the building’s name actually represents the building, while 69% of images depicting the building are not annotated with the building’s name. There was also an observation that for most landmarks, 97% of relevant building images were located within 300 m around the building in terms of spatial distribution.</jats:p>",8,9,418,,Geolocation; Information retrieval; Spatial distribution; Landmark; Data source; Data filtering; Distribution pattern; Computer science; Volunteered geographic information,,10.3390/ijgi8090418,2973945743

This study assessed the usefulness of a smartphone GPS tracking system for evaluating the impact of this strategy on cycling behaviour. Methods Cycling usage data were collected from Queenslanders who used a GPS tracking app on their smartphone from 2013-2014. 'Heat' and volume maps of the data were reviewed, and GPS bicycle counts were compared with surveillance data and bicycle counts from automatic traffic-monitoring devices. Results Heat maps broadly indicated that changes in cycling occurred near infrastructure improvements. Volume maps provided changes in counts of cyclists due to these improvements although errors were noted in geographic information system (GIS) geo-coding of some GPS data. Large variations were evident in the number of cyclists using the app in different locations. These variations limited the usefulness of GPS data for assessing differences in cycling across locations. Conclusion Smartphone GPS data are useful in evaluating the impact of improved bicycle infrastructure in one location. Using GPS data to evaluate differential changes in cycling across multiple locations is problematic when there is insufficient traffic-monitoring devices available to triangulate GPS data with bicycle traffic count data.

Volunteer geographical information (VGI) either in the context of citizen science, active crowdsourcing and even passive crowdsourcing has been proven useful in various societal domains such as natural hazards, health status, disease epidemic and biological monitoring. Nonetheless, the variable degrees or unknown quality due to the crowdsourcing settings are still an obstacle for fully integrating these data sources in environmental studies and potentially in policy making. The data curation process in which a quality assurance (QA) is needed is often driven by the direct usability of the data collected within a data conflation process or data fusion (DCDF) combining the crowdsourced data into one view using potentially other data sources as well. Using two examples, namely land cover validation and inundation extent estimation, this paper discusses the close links between QA and DCDF in order to determine whether a disentanglement can be beneficial or not to a better understanding of the data curation process and to its methodology with respect to crowdsourcing data. Far from rejecting the usability quality criterion, the paper advocates for a decoupling of the QA process and the DCDF step as much as possible but still in integrating them within an approach analogous to a Bayesian paradigm.;                     </jats:p>",II-3/W5,,195,202,Conflation; Usability; Citizen science; Data quality; Data science; Sensor fusion; Computer science; Volunteered geographic information; Crowdsourcing; Data curation,,10.5194/isprsannals-ii-3-w5-195-2015,2278553635

A particular form of volunteered geographic information are data from location-based social media (LBSM), which are social network platforms that include location information into shared contents. Being increasingly used as a data source for geospatial research, LBSM data are applicable also outside science since they open up numerous opportunities. Social media networks are extensively used for expressing reactions towards a topic or an event (publicly or within a particular group of people) by exchanging thoughts, opinions, ideas, feelings etc. Key to any framework aiming for analysing these reactions is a definition of dimensions through which reactions can be characterised including ways of describing (What, Who, Where, When) and explaining (How) (Dunkel et al., 2019). The dimensions What, Who, Where and When are invariably explored in many research projects dealing with LBSM, although not necessarily all four dimension are considered in combination in each case. Though, the dimension How has been also addressed so far but with a rather specific focus, like on emotions or sentiment (e.g. Hauthal & Burghardt, 2016). Nevertheless, a systematic breakdown what a reaction can be is lacking, i.e. in which ways people can react to events. The presented work aims at that by demerging the term ‘reaction’ and subsequently proposing a taxonomy. The term ‘reaction’ occurs manifoldly and can describe behaviour or an unpleasant effect, but is also used in chemistry or physics. Within the scope of this work, reactions as a form of human behaviour are of interest. The Oxford English Dictionary defines a human reaction as “any response to an event; something done, felt, or thought in response to a situation, statement, etc.”1. Numerous other definitions hold this tripartition, which serves as the basis for the presented taxonomy. The tripartition is depicted in Figure 1. An emotional reaction towards an event can be related to a past or a future event. In case of a past event, the emotions are referred to its consequences, which are either affecting the reacting person or others, and depend on whether these consequences are (un)desirable for others or whether expectations related to the consequences for self are relevant and, if so, got (dis)confirmed (Ortony, Clore & Collins, 1988). Emotions concerning a future event can evolve diversely based on the agency of the reacting person (Wahner, 2009). A reaction can also occur in the form of an opinion, an appraising thought or an attitude. Opinions can be characterised regarding their content (pro, contra, neutral), holder (personal or collective opinion) and reference (public, scientific, legal, judicial, editorial opinion). Often, in LBSM, particular hashtags become established representing an opinion towards a matter and being used by people with the respective attitude (e.g. the hashtag #voteremain as a contra expression towards Brexit, prior the referendum on the United Kingdom’s membership of the European Union in June 2016). A reaction towards an event in terms of an action, i.e. doing something, can occur within LBSM or beyond. Actions within social media networks need to be regarded from a technical point of view and can be creating own, original content (e.g. tweeting, posting), reacting to content (e.g. liking, favourite), interacting/associating with content (e.g. replying, commenting, mentioning, following) or spreading content (e.g. retweeting, sharing) (Davis, 2016). These kinds of actions are contained in the metadata of LBSM posts. Moving beyond LBSM content as a reaction to an event can happen in the web (e.g. reading a blog post, signing up for a newsletter, downloading an ebook) or outside (e.g. going to a demonstration, stop smoking). Actions beyond LBSM may in turn be pre-announced or reported in LBSM. By utilising an application case, the described three kinds of reactions will be studied and visualised cartographically. Possible extraction methods can include emotions recognition for emotional reactions, sentiment analysis or opinion mining for attitudinal reactions, activity modelling for action-related reactions.

Mining these rapidly growing and timely data in the context of space-time synthesis provides a new perspective for understanding the pulse of shopping behavior. In this chapter, we analyze Black Friday patterns and trends in the USA using a dataset retrieved from Twitter. A spatial-temporal analysis of tweeting patterns is conducted.

At the same time, there is increasing evidence that validation and quality assessment of data (whether that data be volunteered or ‘official’) can sometimes be usefully crowdsourced, i.e. the required efforts can be distributed to a large number of people. However, as with VGI itself, maintaining the consistency, semantics and reliability of volunteered metadata presents a number of challenges. Initiatives which archive the history of features and tags (e.g. OpenStreetMap) lend themselves to some mapping of disputed features, but among citizen science projects in general there is often limited scope for users to comment on their own or others’ submissions in a consistent way which may be translated to any of the currently accepted geospatial metadata standards. At the same time, platforms which allow the publication of more ‘authoritative’ data sets, (e.g. Geonode and ArcGIS Online), have introduced the option of user comments and ratings. Volunteered metadata (on both authoritative and VG information) is potentially of huge value in assessing fitness for purpose, but some form of standardization is required in order to aggregate diverse ‘opinions’ on the content and quality of data sets and extracts the maximum value from this potentially vital resource. We discuss major challenges and present a set of examples of current practice which may assist in this aggregation.",,,151,172,Semantics; Standardization; Geospatial metadata; Citizen science; Reuse; Data science; Current practice; Computer science; Volunteered geographic information; Metadata,,10.1007/978-3-319-70878-2_8,2779446967

On the one hand, remote sensing identifies horizontal urban expansion, and on the other hand, VGI of ecological complaints provides data about informal settlements. This enables the combination of top-down approaches (remote sensing) and bottom-up approaches (ecological complaints). Within the analysis, we identify areas of high urbanization as well as complaint densities and bring them together in a multi-scale analysis using Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Furthermore, we investigate the influence of settlement patterns and main roads on the peri-urbanization process in Mexico City using OpenStreetMap.

Traditionally, such information had been produced and disseminated by authorities, but a new paradigm is emerging: Web 2.0 and mobile computing technologies enable the involved stakeholder communities to produce, access, and consume migration-related information. The purpose of this article is to put forward a new typology for understanding the factors around migration and to examine the potential of crowd-generated data—especially open data and volunteered geographic information—to study such events. Using the recent wave of migration to Europe from the Middle East and northern Africa as a case study, we examine how migration-related information can be dynamically mined and analyzed to study the migrants’ pathways from their home countries to their destination sites, as well as the conditions and activities that evolve during the migration process. These new data sources can provide a deeper and more fine-grained understanding of the migration process, often in real-time, and often through the eyes of the communities affected by it.

The Billboard Map website was designed to help the city regulate signage. The Los Angeles landscape is thick with advertising, and the city efforts to count total of signs has been stymied by litigation and political pressure. Because outdoor advertising is designed to be seen, the community collectively knows how many and where signs exist. As such, outdoor advertising is a perfect subject for VGI. This paper analyzes the Los Angeles community's entries in the Billboard Map website both quantitatively and qualitatively. I find that members of the public are well able to map outdoor advertisements, successfully employing the Google Street View interface to pinpoint sign locations. However, the community proved unaware of the regulatory distinctions between types of signs, mapping many more signs than those the city technically designates as billboards. Though these findings might suggest spatial data quality issues in the use of VGI for municipal record-keeping, I argue that the Billboard Map teaches an important lesson about how the public's conceptualization of the urban landscape differs from that envisioned by city planners. In particular, I argue that community members see the landscape of advertising holistically, while city agents treat the landscape as a collection of individual categories. This is important because, while Los Angeles recently banned new off-site signs, it continues to approve similar signs under new planning categories, with more in the works.</jats:p>",1,2,75,87,The Internet; Advertising; Signage; Geography; Spatial data quality; Urban planning; Volunteered geographic information; Conceptualization; Categorization; Politics,,10.17645/up.v1i2.608,2469569567

VGI has shifted the ways information is created, shared, used and experienced, with important implications for applications of geospatial data, including emergency management. Detailed interviews with 13 emergency management professionals from eight organisations across five Australian states provided insights into the impacts of VGI on official emergency management. Perceived opportunities presented by VGI included improved communication, acquisition of diverse local information, and increased community engagement in disaster management. Identified challenges included the digital divide, data management, misinformation, and liability concerns. Significantly, VGI disrupts the traditional top-down structure of emergency management and reflects a culture shift away from authoritative control of information. To capitalise on the opportunities of VGI, agencies need to share responsibility and be willing to remain flexible in supporting positive community practises, including VGI. Given the high accountability and inherently responsive nature of decision making in disaster management, it provides a useful lens through which to examine the impacts of VGI on official authoritative systems more broadly.

On the one hand, our work exploits earth and environmental sciences for existing interoperability standards, and the foundational data structures, algorithms and software that are required to meet these geospatial information handling tasks. On the other hand, we are concerned with the arising needs to combine human analysis capacities (intelligence augmentation) with machine power (artificial intelligence). This paper provides an overview of the emerging landscape and outlines our (Digital Earth) vision for addressing the upcoming issues. We particularly request the projection and re-use of the existing environmental, earth observation and remote sensing expertise in other sectors, i.e. to break the barriers of all of these silos by investigating integrated applications.",XL-7/W3,,691,697,Digital Earth; Data structure; Exploit; Interoperability; Data science; Earth observation; Computer science; Intelligence amplification; Big data; Geospatial analysis,,10.5194/isprsarchives-xl-7-w3-691-2015,1974764210

Uyeda; Douglas A. Stow; Casey H. Richart,"Vegetation mapping requires extensive field data for training and validation. Volunteered geographic information in the form of geotagged photos of identified plants has the potential to serve as a supplemental data source for vegetation mapping projects. In this study, we compare the locations of specific taxa from the iNaturalist platform to locations identified on both a fine-scale vegetation map and high-resolution ortho-imagery in open-canopy shrubland in San Clemente Island, CA. Due to positional uncertainty associated with the iNaturalist observations, as well as the presence-only nature of the data, it was not possible to perform a traditional accuracy assessment. We instead measured the distance between the location recorded by an iNaturalist observer for a given taxon and the closest mapped individual of that taxon. This distance was within 10 m for a majority of the observations (64%). When comparing the iNaturalist location to the closest individual detected through image interpretation, 87% of the observations were within 10 m. The discrepancy in agreement between the vegetation map and imagery is likely due to mapping errors.

Citizen Science involves a collaboration or partnership between scientists and amateur volunteers, which may take various forms; from simple data collection to a close collaboration where both parts jointly define their aims, methodologies and analysis approaches in the scientific endeavour. Although citizen science has existed for more than two centuries (Silvertown, 2009), the widespread use of information and communication technology (ICT) now plays a significant role in the way citizen science is currently shaped and utilised. At present, there are hundreds of citizen science applications available which engage thousands of volunteers in the disciplines of astronomy, environmental conservation, biology, marine science, geography and many others. A relatively recent analysis of 388 citizen science projects revealed that they have been used to engage 1.3 million volunteers, contributing up to US$2.5 billion in-kind annually (Theobald et al. 2015). Web 2.0 and its associated technologies, which have existed for almost 15 years now, have enabled the development of websites which supported content generation by their end users (aka crowdsourcing; Howe, 2008) and multiple interactions amongst them. Examples include web-based communities, social-networking sites, wikis, mashups, and others (Batty et al., 2010). In this context the term ‘Neogeography’ was coined (Eisnor, 2006) and since then it has been used within the geographic and cartographic circles to describe the multi-directional generation of geospatial contents and interactions, which enables non-GIS professionals to create and share maps and other geographic information online “on their own terms” simply using the “elements of an existing toolset” (Eisnor, 2006). Map mashups started to not only be used for disseminating spatial information to a wider user audience, but applications have been created which enabled the crowdsourcing of geographic information for the production of geospatial knowledge; a trend, which is also known under the term Volunteered Geographic Information (Goodchild, 2007). OpenStreetMap (OSM) is perhaps one of the earliest examples that the literature cites to demonstrate how harnessing the power of the crowds for the collection of geographic information can result in the creation of a free, open source of map of the world (Goodchild, 2007; Haklay et al., 2008; Batty et al., 2010). We argue in this paper that the above developments from the geospatial context have massively contributed to the current state of citizen science. While interactive web maps made their appearance as mainly “way-finding” tools (Skarlatidou and Haklay, 2006), they quickly became part of digital interactions in a much broader context and they are currently a basic component of most citizen science projects. The relevance and significance of space has been fully exploited by technological features such as geotagging, GPS-enabled mobile devices fully integrated with other sensors, which has made the collection and sharing of data much easier (Haklay, 2013). Sinton (2018) argues that it is such the power of maps in citizen science that “it would be difficult to pursue a project in biological conservation, for example, without incorporating mapping”. The breadth of citizen science applications is so wide that we observe an extremely wide range of potential users, with very different skill sets, backgrounds, literacy levels and user needs.",1,,339,2,Mashup; Citizen science; Geography; Data science; Neogeography; Geotagging; Volunteered geographic information; Crowdsourcing; End user; Geospatial analysis,,10.5194/ica-abs-1-339-2019,2960596637

Jackson; William F. Mullen; Peggy Agouris; Andrew Crooks; Arie Croitoru; Anthony Stefanidis,"The assessment of the quality and accuracy of Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) contributions, and by extension the ultimate utility of VGI data has fostered much debate within the geographic community. The limited research to date has been focused on VGI data of linear features and has shown that the error in the data is heterogeneously distributed. Some have argued that data produced by numerous contributors will produce a more accurate product than an individual and some research on crowd-sourced initiatives has shown that to be true, although research on VGI is more infrequent. This paper proposes a method for quantifying the completeness and accuracy of a select subset of infrastructure-associated point datasets of volunteered geographic data within a major metropolitan area using a national geospatial dataset as the reference benchmark with two datasets from volunteers used as test datasets.

R. Fraser Taylor,"Abstract This chapter summarizes some of the recent developments in the theory and practice of cybercartography discussed in this book and the substantial changes that have taken place since the first edition of the book was published in 2005. The seven major elements of cybercartography outlined in the first edition have been supplemented by six key ideas, and the definition of cybercartography has been extended and expanded. The new practice of mapping a traditional knowledge (TK) in partnership with indigenous people has led to a new theoretical understanding as well as innovative cybercartographic atlases. The chapter explores the nature of TK as a ‘people’s way of knowing’ and how to best represent this. A cybermap is a physical artifact but also a cognitive and social construct. The chapter considers the relationship between cybercartography and critical cartography, volunteered geographic information and the relationship with the individual user. The holistic nature of cybercartography is explained and important legal and ethical issues are explored. The chapter includes a brief description of key issues reflected in the 22 chapters of the book and concludes that cybercartography meets the challenges posed by Tim Berners-Lee for the Web 3.0 era.",5,,1,15,Social constructionism; Geography; Critical cartography; Ethical issues; Key issues; Social science; Traditional knowledge; Engineering ethics; Indigenous; Volunteered geographic information; General partnership,,10.1016/b978-0-444-62713-1.00001-5,43571695

A place-specific inquiry into the OSM contributor sets in small cities allows an intimate look at user motives, locations, and editing habits that are readily described in the OSM metadata and user profile pages, but often missed by aggregate studies of OSM data. Using quantitative and qualitative evidence from the OSM history of five small cities across North and South America, I show that OSM is not accumulating large local corpuses of editors outside of major urban areas. In these more remote places OSM remains largely at the mercy of an unpredictable mix of casual contributions, business interests, feature-specific “hobbyists”, bots, and importers, all passing through the map at different scales for different reasons. I present a typology of roles played by contributors as they expand and fix OSM in casual, systematic, and automated fashion. I argue that these roles are too complex to be conceptualized with the traditional “citizen as sensor” model of understanding volunteered geographic information. While some contributors are driven by pride of place, others are more interested in improving map quality or ensuring certain feature types are represented. Institutions considering the use of OSM data in their projects should be aware of these varied influences and their potential effects on the data.",82,3,455,473,Advertising; Engineering; Data science; Geoweb; User profile; Casual; Volunteered geographic information; Crowdsourcing; Typology; Human geography; Metadata,,10.1007/s10708-015-9695-6,2193017059

While its basic concept is generally understandable, approaches towards the density measure are manifold, diverse and of multidimensional complexity. This evolves from differing thematic, spatial and calculative specifications. Consequently, applied density measures are often used in a subjective, non-transparent, unspecific and thus non-comparable manner. In this paper, we aim at a systematic deconstruction of the measure density. Varying thematic, spatial and calculative dimensions show significant influence on the measure. With both quantitative and qualitative techniques of evaluation, we assess the particular influences on the measure density. To do so, we reduce our experiment setting to a mere physical perspective; that is, the quantitative measures building density, degree of soil sealing, floor space density and, more specifically, the density of generic structural classes such as open spaces and highest built-up density areas. Using up-to-date geodata derived from remote sensing and volunteered geographic information, we build upon high-quality spatial information products such as 3-D city models. Exemplified for the comparison of two European megacities, namely Paris and London, we reveal and systemize necessary variables to be clearly defined for meaningful conclusions using the density measure.",5,11,206,,Megacity; Deconstruction; Spatial analysis; Geography; Data science; Soil sealing; Building density; Normative; Volunteered geographic information; Cartography; Thematic map,,10.3390/ijgi5110206,2549702911

In order to achieve this, a Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) dataset was used, the OpenStreetMap (OSM) project. To test the developed model, a total of 8550 accidents with fatal or non-fatal injuries that occurred in the City of Zagreb from 2010 to 2014 were evaluated. Traffic accident data was collected using the pen-and-paper method while the traffic accident locations were determined using Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers embedded within police vehicles. This form of data entry invariably introduces errors in both geometric and contextual attributes. To fully counteract these errors, the developed model consists of two key concepts: the Jaro–Winkler string matching technique and the Inverse Distance Weighting method. Over 66% of traffic accident locations were validated, which is an increase of 15% when compared to the classical approach. The model outlined in this paper shows a significant improvement in estimating the correct location of traffic accidents. This in turn results in a drastic decrease in resources needed to estimate the quality of accident locations",68,,185,193,Data mining; Engineering; Data file; Traffic accident; Poison control; Simulation; Inverse distance weighting; Volunteered geographic information; Global Positioning System; String searching algorithm; Data validation,,10.1016/j.trc.2016.04.003,2341741027

Algal bloom occurrence in water bodies varies greatly in terms of both space and time, even during short periods, which makes reliable monitoring of blooms difficult. In this paper, we explore the possibilities to extend the sensor network both spatially and temporally by applying participatory sensing to surface algal bloom monitoring in Finnish lakes and the coastal areas of the Baltic Sea. Results: Two participatory sensing systems were used to collect visual algae observations by citizens: the mobile phone application Levavahti (Algae Watch) and the collaborative web service Jarviwiki (Lake wiki), during the summers of 2011–2013. Citizen observations were compared with the visual observations performed by trained expert observers, and mean correlations between citizen and expert observations were calculated using the bootstrapping method: 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.53 0.86]; 0.65, 95% CI [0.35 0.86]; and 0.56, 95% CI [0.29 0.76] for the years 2011, 2012 and 2013. Conclusions: Surface algal bloom monitoring is needed to obtain data on algal bloom frequency and intensity, in particular in lakes where the use of satellite remote sensing has limitations and/or phytoplankton monitoring is infrequent or totally lacking. The correlations between expert and citizen observations suggest that citizen observers can provide additional information to support algal bloom monitoring of inland and coastal waters.",3,1,24,,Oceanography; Algal bloom; Eutrophication; Citizen science; Citizen journalism; Participatory sensing; Phytoplankton; Baltic sea; Environmental science; Algae,,10.1186/s40068-014-0024-8,2171364138

Amanqui; Kleberson Junio do Amaral Serique; José L.

A new generation of gazetteers has to tackle these problems. In this paper, we present a new architecture for gazetteers that uses VGI and Semantic Web tools, such as ontologies and Linked Open Data to overcome these limitations. We also present a gazetteer, the Semantic Web Interactive Gazetteer (SWI), implemented using this architecture, and show that it can be used to add absent geographic coordinates to biodiversity records. In our tests, we use this gazetteer to correct geographic data from a big sample (around 142,000 occurrence records of Amazonian specimens) from SpeciesLink, a big repository of biodiversity collection records from Brazil. The tests showed that the SWI Gazetteer was able to add geographic coordinates to around 30,000 records, increasing the records with coordinates from 30.29% to 57.5% of the total number of records in the sample (representing an increase of 90%).",54,,389,398,Toponymy; Geographic coordinate system; Semantics; World Wide Web; Ontology (information science); Semantic Web; Information retrieval; Implementation; Computer science; Volunteered geographic information; Linked data,,10.1016/j.future.2015.05.006,2203839147

Angryk,"Quality control for real-time spatio-temporal data is often presented from the perspective of the original owner and provider of the data, and focuses on general techniques for outlier detection or uses domain-specific knowledge and rules to assess quality. The impact of quality control on the data aggregator and redistributor is neglected. As sensor networks proliferate, multiple providers can distribute and redistribute the same original sensor data. Relationships between providers become complex, with data acquired from original and third-party sources. One provider may acquire data from another, and so forth, resulting in larger data sets with value-added components such as quality indicators, but with costs such as increased lag between original observation times and (re)distribution times. The focus of this paper is to define and demonstrate quality control measures for real-time, spatio-temporal data from the perspective of an aggregator to provide tools for evaluation and comparison of overlapping, real-time, spatio-temporal data providers and for assessment and optimization of data acquisition, system operation and data redistribution. We define simple measures that account for temporal completeness and spatial coverage. The measures and methods developed are tested on real-world data and applications. Our results show that these simple measures combine to form methods that are useful in comparing providers and identifying patterns in data which can then be exploited to optimize system performance relative to bandwidth, and to assess the impact of provider quality control mechanisms.

With the exponential increase in volunteered geographic information, it is now possible to assess visitation to parks by people using social media. The number of routes posted to MapMyFitness, Strava and Wikiloc were used to assess the relative popularity of 40 national parks in South East Queensland, Australia for mountain biking, walking and running. Then, using generalised linear models, the topographic, geographic, management and environmental variables that best predicted park popularity among users were identified. There were more than 450,000 visits to the parks, with 98% of routes posted on Strava. Distance (road and direct distance) from large urban areas best predicted visitation using routes from MapMyFitness and Strava with three parks within 2 km of urban areas experiencing over 70,000 visits (Strava). For urban parks, recreational trail length best predicted usage, while for more remote parks, the direct distance to urban areas remained the most important factor. In contrast, people using the adventure platform Wikiloc preferred more remote parks with rugged terrain. The results highlight factors affecting park popularity including distance. With the expansion and densification of cities, including in Australia, urban and peri-urban parks are likely to experience increasing levels of use for fitness-based activities while more remote parks may remain attractive among people focused on adventure.",249,,109413,,Recreation; Popularity; Geographic information system; Adventure; Socioeconomics; Visitor pattern; Social media; Topographic map; Volunteered geographic information,Distance decay models; Geographic information systems; National parks; Recreation; Visitor monitoring; Volunteered geographic information,10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.109413,2971047849
009-723-642-828-747,A study of the spatial patterns of tourist sightseeing based on Volunteered Geographic Information: the case of the Jiuzhai Valley.,,2014,journal article,Tourism Tribune,10025006,,,Wang ShouCheng; Guo Fenghua; Fu Xueqing; Li Renjie,"Volunteered Geographic Information( VGI) is a new data source for tourism geography research,and has multi-temporal and multi-spatial elements. It is an effective supplement when conducting fieldwork and questionnaire tourism data surveys,particularly in the research fields of tourism destination image and tourist behavior. Photographs containing coordinates,points of interest,travel tags,and travel notes describing various locations that are uploaded by tourists to the Internet are all examples of VGIs. A realization that VGI data contains important information and an analysis of respective tourist behavior allows tourism managers to develop a reasonable "" Spatiotemporal Separation"" policy during peak tourist seasons. Moreover,it helps tourism planners in designing a destination image and those in tourism marketing to communicate and market the tourism product.This paper takes China's Jiuzhai Valley,a premier national park located in the Min Shan mountain range in the Northern Sichuan region of southwestern China,as a case study. We discuss the spatial patterns of sightseeing at multiple temporal-spatial scales within the Jiuzhai Valley,and analyze changes in recent years using all the VGI photographs that tourists had uploaded to Google Earth( an online virtual geographic information program) within the Jiuzhai Valley area. We processed their attributes,such as tags,location coordinates,author information,and upload time. Using a kernel density estimation model,we calculated the photograph distribution patterns that indirectly indicated the tourists ' sightseeing patterns. We analyzed the number of views of each photograph by other Internet users and took these results as a weight to calculate a density distribution map. This provides a visual representation of sightseeing distribution patterns for prospective or future tourists. The sightseeing spatial pattern within the Jiuzhai Valley can be analyzed from three spatial scales: the overall destination,the sightseeing routes,and the scenery spots. From an overall destination perspective,we found that the tourist hot spots were mainly located on two sightseeing routes,Shuzheng Valley and Rize Valley. There were few scenic spots that attracted such high levels of attention in other sightseeing routes in the area,including the Zechawa Valley. From a sightseeing route perspective,areas that attracted high levels of attention were located in the Potted Beach Rhinoceros Lake region within the Shuzheng Valley; the Nuorilang Lakes Mirror Lake,the Pearl Waterfall Five Flower Lake,the Panda Lake Waterfall and the Arrow Bamboo Lake regions within the Rize Valley; the Five Colors Lake Long Lake region within the Zechawa Valley; and the Jiuzhai Valley entrance. From a scenery spot perspective,specific features such as the Shuzheng Lakes,the Nuorilang Lakes,the Pearl Shoal,the Five Flower Lake,the Panda Lake and the Arrow Bamboo Lake attract high levels of attention and are core Jiuzhai Valley attractions. The Semo and Yuzhigonggai mountains are beautiful ecotourism landscapes; however,they received less attention because of their high elevations. Areas famous for Tibetan culture,such as the Lotus Valley,Jianpan Village and Panya Village also attracted lower levels of attention. The weighted analysis of photograph views by Internet users showed that prospective tourists are guided by the photographs uploaded by previous tourists. The prospective tourist spatial pattern analysis showed hierarchical characteristics.",29,2,84,92,Mountain range; Waterfall; Ecotourism; Spatial ecology; Tourism; Geography; National park; Volunteered geographic information; Cartography; Tourism geography,,,2994062259

Recreational activities in snow-covered mountainous terrain in the backcountry account for the vast majority of avalanche accidents. Studies analyzing avalanche risk mostly rely on accident statistics without considering exposure (or the elements at risk), i.e., how many, when and where people are recreating, as data on recreational activity in the winter mountains are scarce. To fill this gap, we explored volunteered geographic information on two social media mountaineering websites – bergportal.ch and camptocamp.org. Based on these data, we present a spatiotemporal pattern of winter backcountry touring activity in the Swiss Alps and compare this with accident statistics. Geographically, activity was concentrated in Alpine regions relatively close to the main Swiss population centers in the west and north. In contrast, accidents occurred equally often in the less-frequented inner-alpine regions. Weekends, weather and avalanche conditions influenced the number of recreationists, while the odds to be involved in a severe avalanche accident did not depend on weekends or weather conditions. However, the likelihood of being involved in an accident increased with increasing avalanche danger level, but also with a more unfavorable snowpack containing persistent weak layers (also referred to as an old snow problem). In fact, the most critical situation for backcountry recreationists and professionals occurred on days and in regions when both the avalanche danger was critical and when the snowpack contained persistent weak layers. The frequently occurring geographical pattern of a more unfavorable snowpack structure also explains the relatively high proportion of accidents in the less-frequented inner-alpine regions. These results have practical implications: avalanche forecasters should clearly communicate the avalanche danger and the avalanche problem to the backcountry user, particularly if persistent weak layers are of concern. Professionals and recreationists, on the other hand, require the expertise to adjust the planning of a tour and their backcountry travel behavior depending on the avalanche danger and the avalanche problem.",15,9,1985,1997,Physical geography; Recreation; Odds; Travel behavior; Meteorology; Terrain; Geography; Snowpack; Population; Mountaineering; Volunteered geographic information,,10.5194/nhess-15-1985-2015,1649553478

Georeferenced tracks are one of the most common components of VGI, and, as such, are not free from errors. The cleaning of GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) tracks is usually based on the detection and removal of outliers using their geometric characteristics. However, according to our experience, user profile differentiation is still a novelty, and studies delving into the relationship between contributor efficiency, activity, and quality of the VGI produced are lacking. The aim of this study is to design a procedure to filter GNSS traces according to their quality, the type of activity pursued, and the contributor efficiency with VGI. Source data are obtained Wikiloc. The methodology includes tracks classification according mobility types, box plot analysis to identify outliers, bivariate user segmentation according to level of activity and efficiency, and the study of its spatial behavior using kernel-density maps. The results reveal that out of 44,326 tracks, 8096 (18.26%) are considered erroneous, mainly (73.02%) due to contributors’ poor practices and the remaining being due to bad GNSS reception.

This is evident within cartography and geographical sciences more generally, with the quality of volunteered geographic information (VGI) recognized as a major challenge to address if the full potential of citizen sensing in mapping applications is to be realized. Here, a means to characterize the quality of volunteers, based only on the data they contribute, was used to explore issues connected with the quantity and quality of volunteers for attribute mapping. The focus was on data in the form of annotations or class labels provided by volunteers who visually interpreted an attribute, land cover, from a series of satellite sensor images. A latent class model was found to be able to provide accurate characterisations of the quality of volunteers in terms of the accuracy of their labelling, irrespective of the number of cases that they labelled. The accuracy with which a volunteer could be characterized tended to increase with the number of volunteers contributing but was typically good at all but small numbers of volunteers. Moreover, the ability to characterize volunteers in terms of the quality of their labelling could be used constructively. For example, volunteers could be ranked in terms of quality which could then be used to select a sub-set as input to a subsequent mapping task. This was particularly important as an identified subset of volunteers could undertake a task more accurately than when part of a larger group of volunteers. The results highlight that both the quantity and quality of volunteers need consideration and that the use of VGI may be enhanced through information on the quality of the volunteers derived entirely from the data provided without any additional information.",52,4,336,344,Citizen science; Ranking; Geography; Information retrieval; Volunteer; Neogeography; Volunteered geographic information; Crowdsourcing; Latent class model; Thematic map,,10.1080/00087041.2015.1108658,2063375773

Temple-Watts,"<jats:p>Abstract. Floods are one of the most destructive natural disasters that threaten communities and properties. In recent decades, flooding has claimed more lives, destroyed more houses and ruined more agricultural land than any other natural hazard. The accurate prediction of the areas of inundation from flooding is critical to saving lives and property, but relies heavily on accurate digital elevation and hydrologic models. The 2011 Brisbane floods provided a unique opportunity to capture high resolution digital aerial imagery as the floods neared their peak, allowing the capture of areas of inundation over the various city suburbs. This high quality imagery, together with accurate LiDAR data over the area and publically available volunteered geographic imagery through repositories such as Flickr, enabled the reconstruction of flood extents and the assessment of both area and depth of inundation for the assessment of damage. In this study, approximately 20 images of flood damaged properties were utilised to identify the peak of the flood. Accurate position and height values were determined through the use of RTK GPS and conventional survey methods. This information was then utilised in conjunction with river gauge information to generate a digital flood surface. The LiDAR generated DEM was then intersected with the flood surface to reconstruct the area of inundation. The model determined areas of inundation were then compared to the mapped flood extent from the high resolution digital imagery to assess the accuracy of the process. The paper concludes that accurate flood extent prediction or mapping is possible through this method, although its accuracy is dependent on the number and location of sampled points. The utilisation of LiDAR generated DEMs and DSMs can also provide an excellent mechanism to estimate depths of inundation and hence flood damage;                     </jats:p>",I-4,1,251,256,Hydrological modelling; Elevation; Flooding (psychology); Natural hazard; Environmental science; Lidar; Volunteered geographic information; Remote sensing; Flood myth; Real Time Kinematic,,10.5194/isprsannals-i-4-251-2012,2135322774

The resulting app operates by estimating the virtual panorama visible from the viewpoint of the user, using an online Digital Terrain Model (DEM), and by matching such panorama to the actual image framed by the camera. When a good match is found, meta-data from the DEM (e.g., peak name, altitude, distance) are projected in real time onto the view.

The frequency of recent incidents including natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, and hurricanes, and also difficulties caused by the economic downturn has highlighted the vulnerability of human settlements and makes the appropriate consideration of resilience in the planning for future of urban areas of vital significance. Development of an assessment framework for evaluating the extent of resiliency of urban areas can be an effective way of incorporating resiliency-related issues into the urban planning process. For this purpose, it is necessary to clarify the implications of the resilience concept for the sustainability of urban areas. It is also important to identify resilience-related principles and criteria that should be embedded in the framework for assessing the resiliency of urban environments. This study involves an initial review of the literature on resilience and urban sustainability to extract a comprehensive set of criteria that can be used to develop an urban resilience assessment system. Moreover, it tries to design a conceptual framework, illustrative of the inter-relations between these various set of criteria. Criteria for assessment of the resilience of urban areas are divided into several main themes that cover environmental, economic, social, and institutional dimensions of sustainability. These themes would further be broken down into major criteria to account for important relevant areas such as land use, infrastructure, health, etc. The output of this study can be used as the basis for defining a set of precise indicators that will constitute a potential assessment tool for measuring the resilience of urban developments. The resilient assessment process has the capacity to provide decision makers with a clear and comprehensive picture of the resilience of the development proposal and supports them in making better informed decisions.",61,,1491,1495,Environmental resource management; Psychological resilience; Conceptual framework; Business; Natural disaster; Vulnerability; Urban resilience; Land use; Urban planning; Sustainability,,10.1016/j.egypro.2014.12.154,2026031510

By increasing the popularity of smart phones equipped with GPS sensors, more volunteers are expected to join VGI (Volunteered Geographic Information) activities and therefore more positional data will be collected in shorter time. Current statistics from open databases such OpenStreetMap reveals that although there have been exponential growth in the number of contributed POIs (Points of Interest), the lack of detailed attribute information is immediately visible. The process of adding attribute information to VGI databases is usually considered as a boring task and it is believed that contributors do not experience a similar level of satisfaction when they add such detailed information compared to tasks like adding new roads or copying building boundaries from satellite imageries. In other crowdsourcing projects, different approaches are taken for engaging contributors in problem solving by embedding the tasks inside a game. In the literature, this concept is known as ""gamification"" or ""games with purpose"" which encapsulate the idea of entertaining contributors while they are completing a particular defined task. Same concept is used to design a mobile application called “RoadPlex” which aims to collect general or specific attribute information for POIs The increased number of contributions in the past few months confirms that the design characteristics and the methodology of the game are appealing to players. Such growth enables us to evaluate the quality of the generated data through mining the database of answered questions. This paper reflects the some contribution results and emphasises the importance of using gamification concept in the domain of VGI.",2,2,55,60,Point of interest; Data science; Copying; Popularity; Design characteristics; Computer science; Multimedia; Volunteered geographic information; Global Positioning System; Crowdsourcing,,,2168313468

It has been identified in both online and offline projects that rely on volunteers’ effort over the past 20 years and, therefore, can be expected to appear in new projects. This chapter looks at participation inequality (also known as the 1% rule or the 90-9-1 rule), its origins and some of its characteristics. The chapter also explains how participation inequality emerges in a project at both temporal and spatial scales, and also evaluates its implication on the use of VGI and citizen science data. The chapter suggests a generic rule for analysts of VGI and citizen science datasets, in the form: ‘When using and analysing crowdsourced information, consider the implications of participation inequality on the data and take them into account in the analysis.’",,,35,44,Sociology; Regional science; Citizen science; Online and offline; Inequality; Phenomenon; 1% rule; Volunteered geographic information,,10.5334/bax.c,2511344124

Surface water maps can be generated by combining measurements from multiple sources. Precise estimation of surface water using satellite imagery remains a challenging task due to the sensor limitations, complex land cover, topography, and atmospheric conditions. As a complementary dataset, in the case of hilly landscapes, a drainage network can be extracted from high-resolution digital elevation models. Additionally, Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) initiatives, such as OpenStreetMap, can also be used to produce high-resolution surface water masks. In this study, we derive a high-resolution water mask using Landsat 8 imagery and OpenStreetMap as well as (potential) a drainage network using 30 m SRTM. Our approach to derive a surface water mask from Landsat 8 imagery comprises the use of a lower 15% percentile of Landsat 8 Top of Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance from 2013 to 2015. We introduce a new non-parametric unsupervised method based on the Canny edge filter and Otsu thresholding to detect water in flat areas. For hilly areas, the method is extended with an additional supervised classification step used to refine the water mask. We applied the method across the Murray-Darling basin, Australia. Differences between our new Landsat-based water mask and the OpenStreetMap water mask regarding positional differences along the rivers and overall coverage were analyzed. Our results show that about 50% of the OpenStreetMap linear water features can be confirmed using the water mask extracted from Landsat 8 imagery and the drainage network derived from SRTM. We also show that the observed distances between river features derived from OpenStreetMap and Landsat 8 are mostly smaller than 60 m. The differences between the new water mask and SRTM-based linear features and hilly areas are slightly larger (110 m). The overall agreement between OpenStreetMap and Landsat 8 water masks is about 30%",8,5,386,,Geology; Canny edge detector; Digital elevation model; Shuttle Radar Topography Mission; Satellite imagery; Land cover; Volunteered geographic information; Remote sensing; Surface water; Thematic map,,10.3390/rs8050386,2346888824

The existing spatio-temporal data model cannot describe the unique properties of VGI. Therefore, a spatio-temporal VGI model considering trust-related information is presented in this paper. In this model, central elements of the VGI environment, e.g., geographic entity, entity state, state version, contributor, reputation, geographic event, and edit event, and their interaction mechanisms are analysed. Major VGI objects and relations are determined using the object-oriented method and trust-related operations, and their relationships are analysed, and nine linkage rules among trust-related operations are found to maintain the consistency of corresponding data.

We adopted the classification and geolocation of these points to correlate with tweet content by means of manual, supervised, and unsupervised machine learning approaches. Evaluation showed the manual classification approach to be highest quality, followed by the supervised method, and that the unsupervised classification was of low quality. We found that the degree to which tweet content is related to nearby points of interest depends upon topic (that is, upon the OpenStreetMap category).

Citizens often play vital roles in helping those affected to respond and recover, and can provide invaluable assistance to official agencies. However, in most developed countries, emergency and disaster management relies largely on a workforce of professionals and, to varying degrees, volunteers affiliated with official agencies. Those who work outside of such systems have tended to be viewed as a nuisance or liability, and their efforts are often undervalued. Given increasing disaster risk worldwide due to population growth, urban development and climate change, it is likely that ‘informal’ volunteers will provide much of the additional surge capacity required to respond to more frequent emergencies and disasters in the future. This paper considers the role of informal volunteers in emergency and disaster management. Definitions of volunteerism are reviewed and it is argued that there is an overemphasis on volunteering within, and for, state and formal organisations. We offer a broader definition of ‘informal volunteerism’ that recognises the many ways ordinary citizens volunteer their time, knowledge, skills and resources to help others in times of crisis. Two broad types of informal volunteerism are identified – emergent and extending – and the implications for emergency and disaster management are considered. Particular attention is given to increasing ‘digital volunteerism’ due to the greater accessibility of sophisticated but simple information and communication technologies. Culture and legal liability are identified as key barriers to greater participation of informal volunteers. We argue that more adaptive and inclusive models of emergency and disaster management are needed to harness the capacities and resilience that exist within and across communities",13,,358,368,Psychological resilience; Business; Legal liability; Liability; Workforce; Surge Capacity; Poison control; Public relations; Emergency management; Information and Communications Technology,,10.1016/j.ijdrr.2015.07.010,1119706571

We outline a research design that addresses problems of data quality relating to credibility in volunteered geographic information (VGI) intended for Web-enabled participatory planning. Here we have drawn on a dual notion of credibility in VGI data, and propose a methodological workflow to address its criteria. We propose a ‘super-positional’ model of urban community formations, and report on the combination of quantitative and participatory methods employed to underpin its integration. The objective of this methodological phase of study is to enhance confidence in the quality of data for Web-enabled participatory planning. Our participatory method has been supported by rigorous quantification of area characteristics, including participant communities’ demographic and socio-economic contexts. This participatory method provided participants with a ready and accessible format for observing and mark-making, which allowed the investigators to iterate rapidly a system design based on participants’ responses to the workshop tasks. Participatory workshops have involved secondary school-age children in socio-economically contrasting areas of Liverpool (Merseyside, UK), which offers a test-bed for comparing communities’ formations in comparative contexts, while bringing an under-represented section of the population into a planning domain, whose experience may stem from public and non-motorised transport modalities. Data has been gathered through one-day participatory workshops, featuring questionnaire surveys, local site analysis, perception mapping and brief, textual descriptions. This innovative approach will support Web-based participation among stakeholding planners, who may benefit from well-structured, community-volunteered, geo-located definitions of local spaces.</jats:p>",1,2,88,100,Workflow; Geography; Data quality; Credibility; Participatory planning; Population; Participatory GIS; Urban planning; Knowledge management; Volunteered geographic information,,10.17645/up.v1i2.620,2468759521

Griffith; Geoffrey J. Hay,"<jats:p>The objective of this study is to evaluate operational methods for creating a particular type of urban vegetation map—one focused on vegetation over rooftops (VOR), specifically trees that extend over urban residential buildings. A key constraint was the use of passive remote sensing data only. To achieve this, we (1) conduct a review of the urban remote sensing vegetation classification literature, and we then (2) discuss methods to derive a detailed map of VOR for a study area in Calgary, Alberta, Canada from a late season, high-resolution airborne orthomosaic based on an integration of Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA), pre-classification filtering of image-objects using Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI), and a machine learning classifier. Pre-classification filtering lowered the computational burden of classification by reducing the number of input objects by 14%. Accuracy assessment results show that, despite the presence of senescing vegetation with low vegetation index values and deep shadows, classification using a small number of image-object spectral attributes as classification features (n = 9) had similar overall accuracy (88.5%) to a much more complex classification (91.8%) comprising a comprehensive set of spectral, texture, and spatial attributes as classification features (n = 86). This research provides an example of the very specific questions answerable about precise urban locations using a combination of high-resolution passive imagery and freely available VGI data. It highlights the benefits of pre-classification filtering and the judicious selection of features from image-object attributes to reduce processing load without sacrificing classification accuracy.</jats:p>",7,12,462,,Filter (signal processing); Vegetation; Learning classifier system; Urban forestry; Vegetation remote sensing; Geographic object; Late season; Computer science; Volunteered geographic information; Cartography,,10.3390/ijgi7120462,2902463896

In particular, deep learning methods achieve great success in many computer vision problems, such as image classification and object detection. Deep neural networks are very powerful to capture the hierarchical representation of features in massive and complex data by adopting multiple layers of non-linear information processing. Due to the availability of vast and high-resolution geospatial data and efficient high-performance computing architectures, deep learning techniques empower the geospatial system to provide fast and near-human level perception. For example, recent studies have shown deep learning techniques coupled with volunteered geographic information (such as OpenStreetMap data) can accurately extract buildings from satellite imagery for humanitarian mapping in rural African areas. Also, deep learning helps assimilate autonomous vehicles and intelligent transport system by incorporating a great amount of information gathered by traffic cameras and sensors. Moreover, deep learning technology facilitates the discovery of geographic information within unstructured text data across different languages. There are also many other applications of deep learning in the domain of GIS, such as the prediction for spatial diffusion patterns in epidemiology, urban expansion prediction, and hyperspectral image analysis.

They could be gathered under the overarching term citizen surveillance. The discipline, however, still struggles to be widely accepted in the scientific community, mainly because these activities are not embedded in a quantitative framework. This results in an ongoing discussion on how to analyze and make useful inference from these data. When considering the data collection process, we illustrate how citizen surveillance can be classified according to the nature of the underlying observation process measured in two dimensions-the degree of observer reporting intention and the control in observer detection effort. By classifying the observation process in these dimensions we distinguish between crowdsourcing, unstructured citizen science and structured citizen science. This classification helps the determine data processing and statistical treatment of these data for making inference. Using our framework, it is apparent that published studies are overwhelmingly associated with structured citizen science, and there are well developed statistical methods for the resulting data. In contrast, methods for making useful inference from purely crowd-sourced data remain under development, with the challenges of accounting for the unknown observation process considerable.

Illustrating this situation, recently, a number of studies attempted to use LBSN data (e.g., Foursquare check-ins) to investigate patterns of human travel and activity. Of particular note is that compared to other individual-level characteristics of users, such as age, profession, education, income and so forth, gender is relatively highly available in the profiles of Foursquare users. Moreover, considering gender differences in travel and activity analysis is a popular research topic and is helpful in better understanding the changes in women’s roles in family, labor force participation, society and so forth. Therefore, this paper empirically investigates how gender influences the travel and activity patterns of active local Foursquare users in New York City. Empirical investigations of gender differences in travel and activity patterns are conducted at both the individual and aggregate level. The empirical results reveal that there are gender differences in the travel and activity patterns of active local users in New York City at both the individual and aggregate level.

Arozarena; G. Villa; N. Valcárcel; B. Pérez,"Abstract. Remote sensing satellites, together with aerial and terrestrial platforms (mobile and fixed), produce nowadays huge amounts of data coming from a wide variety of sensors. These datasets serve as main data sources for the extraction of Geospatial Reference Information (GRI), constituting the “skeleton” of any Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI). Since very different situations can be found around the world in terms of geographic information production and management, the generation of global GRI datasets seems extremely challenging. Remotely sensed data, due to its wide availability nowadays, is able to provide fundamental sources for any production or management system present in different countries. After several automatic and semiautomatic processes including ancillary data, the extracted geospatial information is ready to become part of the GRI databases. In order to optimize these data flows for the production of high quality geospatial information and to promote its use to address global challenges several initiatives at national, continental and global levels have been put in place, such as European INSPIRE initiative and Copernicus Programme, and global initiatives such as the Group on Earth Observation/Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEO/GEOSS) and United Nations Global Geospatial Information Management (UN-GGIM). These workflows are established mainly by public organizations, with the adequate institutional arrangements at national, regional or global levels. Other initiatives, such as Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI), on the other hand may contribute to maintain the GRI databases updated. Remotely sensed data hence becomes one of the main pillars underpinning the establishment of a global SDI, as those datasets will be used by public agencies or institutions as well as by volunteers to extract the required spatial information that in turn will feed the GRI databases. This paper intends to provide an example of how institutional arrangements and cooperative production systems can be set up at any territorial level in order to exploit remotely sensed data in the most intensive manner, taking advantage of all its potential.",XLI-B4,,721,725,Workflow; Spatial data infrastructure; Global Earth Observation System of Systems; Management system; Geography; Data science; Ancillary data; Earth observation; Volunteered geographic information; Database; Geospatial analysis,,10.5194/isprs-archives-xli-b4-721-2016,2432243244

As the spatial data used in borderland research usually cover the borderland regions of several neighboring countries, it is difficult for anyone research institution of government to collect them. Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) is a highly successful method for acquiring timely and detailed global spatial data at a very low cost. Therefore, VGI is a reasonable source of borderland spatial data. OpenStreetMap (OSM) is known as the most successful VGI resource. However, OSM's data model is far different from the traditional geographic information model. Thus, the OSM data must be converted in the scientist’s customized data model. Because the real world changes rapidly, the converted data must be updated incrementally. Therefore, this paper presents a method used to dynamically integrate OSM data into the borderland database. In this method, a basic transformation rule base is formed by comparing the OSM Map Feature description document and the destination model definitions. Using the basic rules, the main features can be automatically converted to the destination model. A human-computer interaction model transformation and a rule/automatic-remember mechanism are developed to interactively transfer the unusual features that cannot be transferred by the basic rules to the target model and to remember the reusable rules automatically. To keep the borderland database current, the global OsmChange daily diff file is used to extract the change-only information for the research region. To extract the changed objects in the region under study, the relationship between the changed object and the research region is analyzed considering the evolution of the involved objects. In addition, five rules are determined to select the objects and integrate the changed objects with multi-versions over time. The objects’ change-type evolution is analyzed, and seven rules are used to determine the change-type of the changed objects. Based on these rules and algorithms, we programmed an automatic (or semi-automatic) integrating and updating prototype system for the borderland database. The developed system was intensively tested using OSM data for Vietnam and Pakistan as the experimental data.",4,3,1707,1728,Data mining; Spatial analysis; Geography; Information model; Model transformation; Feature description; Experimental data; Volunteered geographic information; Database; Data model,,10.3390/ijgi4031707,1910465634

The potentials of this localized and collective information have been seen to complement the maintenance process of authoritative mapping data sources and in realizing the development of Digital Earth. The main barrier to the use of this data in supporting this bottom up approach is the credibility (trust), completeness, accuracy, and quality of both the data input and outputs generated. The only feasible approach to assess these data is by relying on an automated process. This paper describes a conceptual model of indicators (parameters) and practical approaches to automated assess the credibility of information contributed through the VGI including map mashups, Geo Web and crowd – sourced based applications. There are two main components proposed to be assessed in the conceptual model – metadata and data. The metadata component comprises the indicator of the hosting (websites) and the sources of data / information. The data component comprises the indicators to assess absolute and relative data positioning, attribute, thematic, temporal and geometric correctness and consistency. This paper suggests approaches to assess the components. To assess the metadata component, automated text categorization using supervised machine learning is proposed. To assess the correctness and consistency in the data component, we suggest a matching validation approach using the current emerging technologies from Linked Data infrastructures and using third party reviews validation.

The number of smart phones that are supported by location facility like Global Positioning System (GPS), Camera and connected to the internet has increased sharply in UAE during the last five years. This increase offers a chance to capitalize on using these devices as resources for data collection, therefore reducing cost. In many cases specific events may happen in areas or at time where there may be no governmental departments to collect such unrepeated events. The current research will showcase various studies that had been conducted on Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) debating various aspects such as accuracy, legal issues, and privacy. This research will also integrate Geographic Information System (GIS), VGI, social media tools, data mining, and mobile technology to design a conceptual framework for promoting public participation in UAE. The data gathered through survey will be helpful in correlating various aspects of VGI. Since there are diverse views about these aspects, policy makers are left undecided in many countries about how to deal with VGI. The assessment of the UAE case will contribute to the age-long debate by examining the willingness of the public to participate.

However, access to these technologies, as well as their associated software and training materials, is not evenly distributed: since the 1990s there has been concern about a ""Digital Divide"" between the data-rich and the data-poor. We present an innovative metric for evaluating international variations in access to digital data: the Data Poverty Index (DPI). The DPI is based on Internet speeds, numbers of computer owners and Internet users, mobile phone ownership and network coverage, as well as provision of higher education. The datasets used to produce the DPI are provided annually for almost all the countries of the world and can be freely downloaded. The index that we present in this ‘proof of concept’ study is the first to quantify and visualise the problem of global data poverty, using the most recent datasets, for 2013. The effects of severe data poverty, particularly limited access to geoinformatic data, free software and online training materials, are discussed in the context of sustainable development and disaster risk reduction. The DPI highlights countries where support is needed for improving access to the Internet and for the provision of training in geoinfomatics.

A consensual lexicon is a key factor to enable this open production model. Lexical definitions help demarcate the boundaries of terms, forming a thin semantic ground on which knowledge can travel. In VGI, lexical definitions often appear to be inconsistent, circular, noisy and highly idiosyncratic. Computing the semantic similarity of these ‘volunteered lexical definitions’ has a wide range of applications in GIScience, including information retrieval, data mining and information integration. This article describes a knowledge-based approach to quantify the semantic similarity of lexical definitions. Grounded in the recursive intuition that similar terms are described using similar terms, the approach relies on paraphrase-detection techniques and the lexical database WordNet.

In this contribution, we evaluate the performance of a commercially available low-cost sensor platform for air quality and show how the data from a network of such devices can be used for high-resolution mapping of urban air quality. Our results indicate that the sensor platforms are subject to a significant sensor-to-sensor variability as well as strong dependencies on environmental conditions. A field calibration of all individual sensor devices by co-locating them with an air quality monitoring station equipped with reference instrumentation is thus required for obtaining the best possible results. We further demonstrate that, despite relatively low accuracy at the individual sensor level, a methodology based on geostatistical data fusion is capable of merging the information from the sensor network with model information in such a way that we can obtain realistic and frequently updated maps of urban air quality. We show that exploiting the “swarm knowledge” of the entire network of sensors is capable of extracting useful information from the data even though individual sensors are subject to significant uncertainty.",,,93,110,Air quality index; Swarm behaviour; Instrumentation; Wireless sensor network; Air pollutants; Field calibration; Air quality monitoring; Sensor fusion; Computer science; Real-time computing,,10.1007/978-3-319-70878-2_5,2781215193

In this context, most of the classification algorithms rely on supervised learning to tackle the heterogeneity of the urban environments. However, at a large scale, the process of collecting training samples becomes a huge project in itself. This leads to a growing interest from the remote sensing community toward Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) projects such as OpenStreetMap (OSM). Despite the spatial heterogeneity of its contribution patterns, OSM provides an increasing amount of information on the earth’s surface. More interestingly, the community has moved beyond street mapping to collect a wider range of spatial data such as building footprints, land use, or points of interest. In this paper, we propose a classification method that makes use of OSM to automatically collect training samples for supervised learning of built-up areas. To take into account a wide range of potential issues, the approach is assessed in ten Sub-Saharan African urban areas from various demographic profiles and climates. The obtained results are compared with: (1) existing high resolution global urban maps such as the Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) or the Human Built-up and Settlements Extent (HBASE); and (2) a supervised classification based on manually digitized training samples. The results suggest that automated supervised classifications based on OSM can provide performances similar to manual approaches, provided that OSM training samples are sufficiently available and correctly pre-processed. Moreover, the proposed method could reach better results in the near future, given the increasing amount and variety of information in the OSM database.</jats:p>",10,7,1145,,Geography; Sub saharan; Cartography,,10.3390/rs10071145,2883240105

Both of the factors are observed in the long-term temporal domain and per unit area, in order to support the analysis of the trends and indicators for monitoring the implementation of the 2030 Development Agenda and the related thematic agreements. The GHSL uses various input data, including global, multi-temporal archives of high-resolution satellite imagery, census data, and volunteered geographic information. In this paper, we present a global estimate for the Land Use Efficiency (LUE) indicator—SDG 11.3.1, for circa 10,000 urban centers, calculating the ratio of land consumption rate to population growth rate between 1990 and 2015. In addition, we analyze the characteristics of the GHSL information to demonstrate how the original frameworks of data (gridded GHSL data) and tools (GHSL tools suite), developed from Earth Observation and integrated with census information, could support Sustainable Development Goals monitoring. In particular, we demonstrate the potential of gridded, open and free, local yet globally consistent, multi-temporal data in filling the data gap for Sustainable Development Goal 11. The results of our research demonstrate that there is potential to raise SDG 11.3.1 from a Tier II classification (manifesting unavailability of data) to a Tier I, as GHSL provides a global baseline for the essential variables called by the SDG 11.3.1 metadata.</jats:p>",8,2,96,,Environmental resource management; Spatial analysis; Earth observation; Computer science; Land use; Sustainable development; Volunteered geographic information; Analytics; Metadata; Thematic map,,10.3390/ijgi8020096,2895460600

However, the optimism about the VGI has been tempered by two critical issues: inequality in data coverage (social justice) and data quality. It therefore requires a better understanding of the mechanism driving VGI contributions and content quality. With a case of China, this paper demonstrates one potential avenue, examining the associations between VGI coverage/quality and local demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. In particular, VGI data are harvested from the OpenStreetMap for 333 cities in China. VGI coverage is measured by the total volume of different geographic features (point, line and polygon); and VGI quality is described from two aspects: completeness and accuracy. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) shows that both demographic and socioeconomic factors have statistically significant influences on VGI coverage and quality. More specifically, densely populous cities with more young, educated and non-agricultural people enjoy higher VGI coverage and quality. Cities with lower VGI coverage and quality are primarily located in the western and southwestern regions where the ethnic minorities concentrate. High VGI coverage and quality are possibly observed in economically developed cities with high marketization degree. Besides, possibility of high VGI coverage and quality occurs in cities with more labor in scientific research and greater percentage of employers in the tertiary industry. The GWR also demonstrates that the strength and nature of the obtained relationships vary across the 333 cities. The spatial non-stationary relationships may partially answer for the controversial empirical conclusions in earlier case studies at different scales. Quantitative analysis (Gini index, Lorenz curve and Moran's I index) further evidences the great inequality in VGI coverage and quality. It can be safely inferred that the differences in engagement and use of VGI, as a new digital divide, can raise troubling concerns on the social justice implications.",78,,78,93,Socioeconomic status; Regional science; Digital divide; Geography; Data quality; Popularity; Spatial inequality; Socioeconomics; Inequality; Volunteered geographic information; Lorenz curve,,10.1016/j.apgeog.2016.11.002,2560018148

Bégin; Rodolphe Devillers; Stéphane Roche,"<jats:p>Abstract. VGI changed the mapping landscape by allowing people that are not professional cartographers to contribute to large mapping projects, resulting at the same time in concerns about the quality of the data produced. While a number of early VGI studies used conventional methods to assess data quality, such approaches are not always well adapted to VGI. Since VGI is a user-generated content, we posit that features and places mapped by contributors largely reflect contributors’ personal interests. This paper proposes studying contributors’ mapping processes to understand the characteristics and quality of the data produced. We argue that contributors’ behaviour when mapping reflects contributors’ motivation and individual preferences in selecting mapped features and delineating mapped areas. Such knowledge of contributors’ behaviour could allow for the derivation of information about the quality of VGI datasets. This approach was tested using a sample area from OpenStreetMap, leading to a better understanding of data completeness for contributor’s preferred features.;                     </jats:p>",XL-2/W1,1,149,154,Geography; Information retrieval; Data quality; Sample area; Volunteered geographic information,,10.5194/isprsarchives-xl-2-w1-149-2013,2167855612

Dunham,"Abstract Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) and urban forests have recently become topics of increasing interest in the social sciences. While social and environmental justice concerns have been applied to each of these topics individually, this paper addresses VGI, urban forests, and social justice simultaneously. VGI has often been hailed as an empowering and democratic new form of citizen science that allows data collection tasks to be distributed to a large group of people; however, concerns have emerged about whose geographies will be volunteered, and for what purpose. This research addresses these concerns, with an understanding that VGI has the potential to strengthen, rather than dissolve the digital divide. This is accomplished by determining the completeness of coverage of user-generated urban forest mapping on the interactive website PhillyTreeMap ( http://www.phillytreemap.org/ ) by comparing it with high resolution remotely sensed canopy coverage data. These coverage levels are then regressed against Census demographic data at the block group level to determine if there are inequities in the coverage of this urban forest VGI project based upon socioeconomic status. Results indicate that sociodemographic variables influence the likelihood of increased coverage of the VGI urban forest data, presenting equity concerns surrounding the coverage of this VGI urban forest data. The presence of these social and environmental justice concerns indicates the need for expanded research into this new frontier of geographic data. Geographically weighted general linear models show non-stationarity in the relationships between VGI coverage and sociodemographic predictors, demonstrating the importance of incorporating local models.",53,,65,75,Environmental resource management; Data collection; Digital divide; Citizen science; Geography; Urban forest; Equity (finance); Environmental justice; Coverage data; Volunteered geographic information,,10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2014.08.001,2030773894

As a result, Public Participation Geographic Information Systems (PPGIS) has significantly increased the capacity to identify community desires, convey municipal plans, and leverage university resources. Within the last five years, technology has departed from a mostly exclusive process that shielded public information through proprietary software to open data and spatial formats not previously accessible at the neighborhood or regional scale. Municipal budgets are now earmarking more technology dollars and increasing the capacity for locales to bolster infrastructure and drive programs. With the availability of spatially-enabled websites from the federal, state and local levels, costs are further reduced and access is significantly increased. These factors have dramatically shifted us in the direction of providing a better picture of neighborhood demographics and to evaluate quality of life issues. With the progression of PPGIS, variations in the technology's adaptability and application have brought forth critiques related to access, technology, and time. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) permeates a global market and technology appears to drive social, economic and civic progress with varying outcomes. Residents, advocates, and community organizations are utilizing democratized data in ways that early PPGIS investors could not have imagined. However, while many applaud the ability to create a trinity with data serving as a neutral partner, some wonder if any advancement has been made. A major critique of PPGIS is the inability to have a sustained, longitudinal impact that applies a 'middle through' approach of GIS theory to practice or praxis (Ferreira 1998; Thompson 2011). Also, the potential for mismanaging or intentionally misrepresenting information has increased significantly with the use of spatial data (Monmonier 1996). Adding to the PPGIS conundrum is Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) accompanied by increased concerns about data integrity, accuracy and reliability (Thompson 2011). With the inclusion of public data, the ability to shape public policy has improved but not equally in rural and urban environments. URISA's Special Issue on PPGIS addresses many of these critiques. Our authors report on innovative utilization of PPGIS that allows for increased community participation in the development of spatial tools and VGI data. The reliance on an intermediary, such as a university, for creation of base maps, GIS programming, data development or analysis is desired but not required. A number of 'plug and play' internet mapping services have decreased or eliminated the issues of access and cost that hampered successful development of earlier PPGIS projects. Data reliability has increased with the integration of community and municipal data within the same platform. Essentially, these developments have helped to create a new era, if not a new PPGIS. Interestingly, the advances in these technologies and integration with planning are associated more with developed countries, and in particular North America, although it was in Africa that the idea of evaluating space, time and resources was ""invented"" through trade (Lacroix 1998). The Roman Empire is recognized as defining much of modern mapping language before it was documented in Western Europe. As such, our collection of articles provides a broad survey of PPGIS application across the globe. This special issue of the URISA journal presents local to regional and national to international applications that inform the new PPGIS. Our survey begins with a comprehensive evaluation of PPGIS as a utility for environmental planning.

Modern types of civic participation can enhance those processes by acquiring citizens’ ideas and feedback in participatory sensing approaches like “People as Sensors”. As such, citizen-centric planning can be achieved by analysing Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) data such as Twitter tweets and posts from other social media channels. These user-generated data comprise several information dimensions, such as spatial and temporal information, and textual content. However, in previous research, these dimensions were generally examined separately in single-disciplinary approaches, which does not allow for holistic conclusions in urban planning. This paper introduces TwEmLab, an interdisciplinary approach towards extracting citizens’ emotions in different locations within a city. More concretely, we analyse tweets in three dimensions (space, time, and linguistics), based on similarities between each pair of tweets as defined by a specific set of functional relationships in each dimension. We use a graph-based semi-supervised learning algorithm to classify the data into discrete emotions (happiness, sadness, fear, anger/disgust, none). Our proposed solution allows tweets to be classified into emotion classes in a multi-parametric approach. Additionally, we created a manually annotated gold standard that can be used to evaluate TwEmLab’s performance. Our experimental results show that we are able to identify tweets carrying emotions and that our approach bears extensive potential to reveal new insights into citizens’ perceptions of the city.</jats:p>",1,2,114,127,Algorithm; Geography; Happiness; Participatory sensing; Sadness; Participatory planning; Linguistics; Urban planning; Social media; Volunteered geographic information; Semi-supervised learning,,10.17645/up.v1i2.617,2464046665

Despite the advanced technological data collection methods now available, the role of experiential knowledge remains marginal in planning practice. The utilisation of digital tools in participatory planning remains effectively additional to and detached from the core planning tasks. Many different actors, developers and researchers have created separate GIS-based data harnessing tools, such as planning support systems (PSS), public participation geographic information systems (PPGIS) and tools gathering volunteered geographic information (VGI). Despite the innovative technological work undertaken, challenges remain in adapting these tools on a profound and permanent level to the support of participatory planning practices. The planning technology literature focused on the development of forward-looking technology is rarely linked to the theoretical discussions occurring in the participatory planning literature. This dissertation aims to build a bridge between these two distinct discussions.; The object of this thesis is to study the potential of these tools to support participatory urban planning. The research analyses a set of SoftGIS and other PPGIS studies conducted during the period 2004-2015 in varying research and urban planning projects in Finland. The thesis adopts a normative approach to the question of how various PPGIS tools could be embedded more securely into the urban planning process. The thesis constructs a heuristic conceptual model for a participatory planning support system (PPSS), based on the experiences of applying PPGIS tools.; The central observations of this thesis reflect the numerous ways in which PPGIS tools and experiential knowledge can support planning during the different stages of the planning process and in relation to different planning tasks. At best, PPGIS methods can produce multifaceted information, especially in the early phases of the planning process. Data gathering however remains effectively characterised as singular interventions to harness specific information for the direct purposes of the ongoing planning task. Embedding this experiential knowledge more fully into the planning system currently rests almost exclusively on the shoulders of individual planners. Grafting PPSS onto the planning system requires a rather more strategic approach to participation.Osallistuvan suunnittelun nykykäytännöt eivät mahdollista kattavan ja monipuolisen vuorovaikutuksen toteutumista. Teknisesti edistyneistä tiedonkeruumenetelmistä huolimatta kokemuksellisen tiedon rooli on yhä marginaalinen suunnittelussa. Digitaalisten työkalujen hyödyntäminen osallistuvan suunnittelun tukena onkin hajanaista ja suunnittelutehtävistä irrallaan. Monet eri toimijat, kehittäjät ja tutkijat ovat kehittäneet erillisiä paikkatietopohjaisia työkaluja, kuten suunnittelun tukijärjestelmiä (PSS), osallistuvia paikkatietojärjestelmiä (PPGIS) ja vapaaehtoisesti tuotettua paikkatietoa (VGI) kerääviä menetelmiä. Haasteeksi jää sopeuttaa nämä kehitetyt työkalut pysyvämmin suunnittelukäytännön tueksi. Edistyksellisten suunnittelu- ja paikkatietoteknologioiden kehittämiseen keskittynyt tutkimus yhdyskuntasuunnittelukentällä linkittyy harvoin osallistuvaa suunnittelua koskevaan teoreettiseen keskusteluun. Tämä väitöskirja pyrkii rakentamaan tällaisen sillan.; Väitöskirjan tavoitteena on tutkia näiden työkalujen mahdollisuuksia tukea osallistuvaa kaupunkisuunnittelua. Väitöskirjassa on tarkasteltu PehmoGIS- ja PPGIS menetelmien kehittämistä ja hyödyntämistä sekä tutkimuksessa että suunnittelussa Suomessa vuosina 2004–2015. Työ on lähtökohdaltaan normatiivinen, se pyrkii ohjaamaan ja etsimään vastauksia siihen, miten paikkatietopohjaiset osallistuvan suunnittelun työkalut voitaisiin paremmin sitoa suunnitteluprosessin tueksi. Työ rakentaa käsitteellisen mallin osallistuvan suunnittelun heuristisesta tukijärjestelmästä, joka perustuu kokemuksiin PPGIS työkalujen hyödyntämisestä.; Väitöskirjan keskeiset havainnot liittyvät PPGIS työkalujen ja paikallisen kokemustiedon moninaiseen tarpeeseen suunnitteluprosessin eri vaiheissa ja erilaisissa suunnittelutehtävissä.

We establish a characteristic flow rate from catchment area attributes (population, distance to exit node, and exit node width) and a mean flow rate in a free-flow regime by simulating total evacuations using an agent based ""queuing network"" model. We use these variables to determine a relationship between catchment area attributes and resultant ETEs.

Therefore, heterogeneous geographic information at different spatial scales and from multiple sources is combined by applying geoinformation analysis methods such as spatial interpolation, aggregation and downscaling techniques. Geocoded malnutrition data from the Demographic and Health Survey Program are the most common information source to quantify the prevalence of malnutrition on a local scale and are frequently combined with regional data on climate, population, agriculture and/or infrastructure.

The main idea at that time was to enable and enhance communication between citizens and decision makers with the help of a geographical information system (GIS). Rinner (1999, 2005, 2006) contributed a model known as argumentation maps that modeled relations of geographically referenced objects with the opinions of citizens. One of the first implemented PPGIS applications was titled Virtual Slaithwaite and developed in 1998. It was ""arguably among the first such systems available to the public which allowed a two-way flow of information"" (Carver, Evans et al. 2012). Research at that time mostly focused on discussions about a variety of participatory functionalities that could possibly be integrated into a GIS (Steinmann, Krek et al. 2004). Around 2005, the enthusiasm about PPGIS began to fade, but the research community still had several very interesting study cases and applications implemented mostly by universities. The conceptual ideas were inspiring but did not lead to user-friendly implementations in practice. Several possible issues led to such a development: (1) The complexity of the applications was criticized by several researchers (Basedow and Pundt 2001; Craig, Harris et al. 2002; Haklay and Tobon 2003; Steinmann, Krek et al. 2004); (2) the computer skills of the participants in public participation processes were not taken into consideration; and (3) the interaction with online interactive maps was rather complex and in many cases too difficult for non-GIS experts. Carver (2001: 64) pointed to the problem in the following way: ""Access to GIS alone does not, however, provide the public user with a satisfactory means of active participation in the decision process. GIS is far too complex a technology to allow effective use by the nonspecialist with little or no previous training or experience in this field."" More than a decade later, we experience emerging collaborative mapping processes in which citizens contribute their knowledge via open-source platforms such as OpenStreet Map. The researchers refer to these processes as ""volunteered geographical information"" (Goodchild 2007), ""neogeography"" (Turner 2006, Goodchild 2009), or ""geography without geographers"" (Sui 2008). This new development demonstrates the interest of the citizens to participate and use map-based participation tools. Perhaps now is the appropriate time for further developments of the PPGIS concept and its implementations. The aim of this paper is to study the implementation of a PPGIS with open-source technology and its integration with an online questionnaire. This research builds on the previous work in PPGIS and research conducted by Sidman, Swett et al. (2005) and Al-Kodmany (2001). Sidman, Swett et al. (2005) focused on the development of a paper, nondigital questionnaire that was sent to the participants of the survey in the mail. Their responses were manually inserted into a GIS and later communicated to the focus group. Al-Kodmany (2001) and his research colleagues at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) developed an online survey tool, but a GIS program was used ""only at a later stage for analyzing the composite participants' data and integrating it with other GIS layers"" (Al-Kodmany 2001). This novel contribution is in the integration of an online questionnaire with interactive GIS-based maps. Specifically, it is in the technical implementation that enables the users to interact with a GIS-based map. The online questionnaire is directly linked to the interactive online map and the answers to the questionnaire and those answers entered on the map are stored in a GIS database on the server. No comparable implementation that presents a similar innovation of PPGIS has been found. …",24,2,75,,World Wide Web; Information system; Computer literacy; Citizen journalism; Neogeography; Public participation; Computer science; Collaborative mapping; Public participation GIS; Knowledge management; Computer-assisted web interviewing,,,286073817

In order to evaluate the usability of these data as part of an authoritative dataset, it is first necessary to understand the quality and reliability of the data. Several studies have been conducted in Europe to compare a volunteer-provided dataset, OpenStreetMap (OSM), to authoritative data sources. The methodology used in these studies was the basis for studying OSM data over rural, suburban, and urban areas in three regions of the United States. The methodology was adapted to compare the volunteer-provided data in OSM to TIGER data from the U.S. Census Bureau which was used as the baseline data to initially populate OSM in the United States. The results showed that road network lengths in all areas studied were increased by volunteers. The increases were greater in more densely populated areas. The density of the OSM road network was generally found to be higher than the density of the baseline TIGER dataset, especially in urban areas. The types of features collected by volunteers were similar to the baseline dataset, but, showed increased percent feature content for pedestrian transportation features.

Comparison of a VGI dataset with a reference dataset in order to find data correspondence is a common process in some analyses of VGI data, such as quantitative analysis of its quality. This study addresses this case and presents an automated feature matching method for VGI linear data. The proposed method consists of two main steps. In the first step, a feature point matching method based on a novel descriptor, named Location-Orientation Rotary Descriptor (LORD), is performed. The proposed LORD descriptor uses the location and orientation information of the linear data in a log polar structure and in a rotary manner. In the second step, a new segment matching strategy based on the buffered linear features is performed to reject the outliers of the previous step.

This phenomenon is known as volunteered geographic information (VGI). During the past decade VGI has been used as a data source supporting a wide range of services, such as environmental monitoring, events reporting, human movement analysis, disaster management, etc. However, these volunteer-contributed data also come with varying quality. Reasons for this are: data is produced by heterogeneous contributors, using various technologies and tools, having different level of details and precision, serving heterogeneous purposes, and a lack of gatekeepers. Crowd-sourcing, social, and geographic approaches have been proposed and later followed to develop appropriate methods to assess the quality measures and indicators of VGI. In this article, we review various quality measures and indicators for selected types of VGI and existing quality assessment methods. As an outcome, the article presents a classification of VGI with current methods utilized to assess the quality of selected types of VGI.

Wiersma,"The amateur birding community has a long and proud tradition of contributing to bird surveys and bird atlases. Coordinated activities such as Breeding Bird Atlases and the Christmas Bird Count are examples of ""citizen science"" projects. With the advent of technology, Web 2.0 sites such as eBird have been developed to facilitate online sharing of data and thus increase the potential for real-time monitoring. However, as recently articulated in an editorial in this journal and elsewhere, monitoring is best served when based on a priori hypotheses. Harnessing citizen scientists to collect data following a hypotheticodeductive approach carries challenges. Moreover, the use of citizen science in scientific and monitoring studies has raised issues of data accuracy and quality. These issues are compounded when data collection moves into the Web 2.0 world. An examination of the literature from social geography on the concept of ""citizen sensors"" and volunteered geographic information (VGI) yields thoughtful reflections on the challenges of data quality/data accuracy when applying information from citizen sensors to research and management questions. VGI has been harnessed in a number of contexts, including for environmental and ecological monitoring activities. Here, I argue that conceptualizing a monitoring project as an experiment following the scientific method can further contribute to the use of VGI. I show how principles of experimental design can be applied to monitoring projects to better control for data quality of VGI. This includes suggestions for how citizen sensors can be harnessed to address issues of experimental controls and how to design monitoring projects to increase randomization and replication of sampled data, hence increasing scientific reliability and statistical power. RESUME. La communaute des ornithologues amateurs a une longue et fiere tradition de contribution aux denombrements d’oiseaux et aux projets d’atlas. Les activites telles que les atlas d’oiseaux nicheurs et le Recensement des oiseaux de Noel sont des exemples de ""science citoyenne"". Avec l’avenement de la technologie informatique, des sites internet 2.0 comme celui d’eBird ont ete developpes afin de permettre l’entree en ligne des donnees, ouvrant ainsi la possibilite d’assurer un suivi en temps reel. Cependant, tel que mentionne dans un editorial recemment publie dans cette revue et dans d’autres publications, le suivi est plus efficace lorsqu’il repose sur des hypotheses a priori. Mettre la science citoyenne a contribution pour recolter des donnees en suivant une approche hypothetico-deductive comporte des defis. De plus, le recours aux citoyens dans le cadre d’etudes scientifiques et de programmes de suivi souleve la question de la precision et de la qualite des donnees. Cette question est d’autant plus serieuse lorsque les donnees sont recoltees dans le contexte de l’internet 2.0. Une revue de la litterature en geographie sociale sur les concepts de ""citoyens capteurs"" et d’information geographique volontaire (IGV) fournit des reflexions utiles sur les defis de qualite et de precision des donnees lorsqu’on applique l’information fournie par les citoyens capteurs dans les domaines de la recherche et de la gestion. L’IGV a ete mise a profit dans un grand nombre de contextes, incluant les programmes de suivi ecologique et environnemental. Dans cet essai, je soutiens Department of Biology, Memorial University Avian Conservation and Ecology 5(2): 13 http://www.ace-eco.org/vol5/iss2/art13/ que la conceptualisation d’un projet de suivi en tant qu’experience scientifique peut contribuer davantage a l’utilisation des IGV.

This data volume causes usability problems for the visual presentation and exploration, especially by decreasing rendering performance and increasing geometric or semantic point clutter. Typically, generalization techniques are applied in order to overcome these clutter problems. Appropriate constraint-based approaches have been developed for static and single displays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to the increasing amount and relevance of multi-temporal point data, the aim of this contribution is to present a so far missing conceptual framework that consists of constraints related to change point analysis. These constraints describe the effects of the generalization on preservation and legibility of change information. Here, different types of change point analysis are differentiated, namely: existential changes, changes of semantic properties, and changes of spatial properties. For this purpose, difference frames between two given frames of the multi-temporal data set are used as a model of the mental representation of change information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resulting constraints can be used to describe and to compare the suitability of various generalization operations for specific tasks. However, in a later stage they can also trigger the generalization processes as such. This could lead to a new way of thinking, since the optimization of generalization processes should work on difference frames rather than on single views.&lt;/p&gt;;                     </jats:p>",2,,1,7,Clutter; Conceptual framework; Usability; Semantic property; Rendering (computer graphics); Information retrieval; Legibility; Computer science; Volunteered geographic information; Mental representation,,10.5194/ica-proc-2-114-2019,2959182490

However, the distinction between VGI as an information product and the processes that create VGI is blurred. Clearly, the environment that influences the creation of VGI is different than the information product itself, yet most literature treats them as one and the same. Thus, this research is motivated by the need to formalize and standardize the systems that support the creation of VGI. To this end, we propose a conceptual framework for VGI systems, the main components of which—project, participants, and technical infrastructure—form an environment conducive to the creation of VGI. Drawing on examples from OpenStreetMap, Ushahidi, and RinkWatch, we illustrate the pragmatic relevance of these components. Applying a system perspective to VGI allows us to better understand the components and functionality needed to effectively create VGI",3,4,1278,1292,Systems science; Conceptual framework; Geography; Data science; Geoweb; Information product; Public participation GIS; Knowledge management; Volunteered geographic information; Crowdsourcing,,10.3390/ijgi3041278,1991837421

Citizen science represents a diverse range of approaches, but until now this diversity has not been quantitatively explored. We conducted a systematic internet search and discovered 509 environmental and ecological citizen science projects. We scored each project for 32 attributes based on publicly obtainable information and used multiple factor analysis to summarise this variation to assess citizen science approaches. We found that projects varied according to their methodological approach from ‘mass participation’ (e.g. easy participation by anyone anywhere) to ‘systematic monitoring’ (e.g. trained volunteers repeatedly sampling at specific locations). They also varied in complexity from approaches that are ‘simple’ to those that are ‘elaborate’ (e.g. provide lots of support to gather rich, detailed datasets). There was a separate cluster of entirely computer-based projects but, in general, we found that the range of citizen science projects in ecology and the environment showed continuous variation and cannot be neatly categorised into distinct types of activity. While the diversity of projects begun in each time period (pre 1990, 1990–99, 2000–09 and 2010–13) has not increased, we found that projects tended to have become increasingly different from each other as time progressed (possibly due to changing opportunities, including technological innovation). Most projects were still active so consequently we found that the overall diversity of active projects (available for participation) increased as time progressed.

This will be based on people’s personal characteristics and environmental factors known to affect landscape perception. A prototype user-interface has been designed for eliciting users’ perceptions of landscape elements and colors they perceive from photographs of landscape views. In the long-term, a VGI repository database will be maintained to make personalized location specific recommendations about suitable landscape views for user-specified locations. A prototype fuzzy logic recommendation system comprising 72 rules has also been designed to model how personal factors (gender, age, health status) and perceived colors likely determine the aesthetic suitability of landscape views. An initial trial revealed some limitations and stressed the need for further testing of the feasibility of fuzzy logic as the reasoning framework for this LBS for recommending suitable landscape views. 1. Introduction As urbanity imposes psychological demands that become excessive, people seek stress- reducing (especially natural) environments where they can recreate and relax. The investigation of the ecological and visual aspects of physical landscapes is critical for understanding and addressing many of the psychosomatic disorders of urban dwellers. In this paper, we focus on visual perception of people’s everyday environments. Human-beings engage in a wide variety of important decisions in their everyday lives, based on visual properties of the geographic environment and their geographical knowledge. Examples include coping with environmental visual pollution, finding one’s way in spatially extended areas, and finding a landscape view appropriate to one’s emotional status. Color, shape, composition, and configuration of objects are important components of visual stimuli that should be studied to understand our perceptions of and reactions to physical landscapes in urban environments. In this short paper, we present the rationale and initial design considerations for a prototype Location Based Service (LBS) for landscape view assessment. This LBS will ultimately offer people personalized recommendations for places (near their chosen location(s)) that are most likely to appeal to them aesthetically. The LBS is designed to make such personalized recommendations based on available knowledge of how people’s personal characteristics affects landscape perception. A prototype user-interface has been designed for eliciting users’ perceptions about the types of landscape elements and the colors they perceive in images showing landscape views. An important goal of this project is to maintain a large database of people’s perception of landscape views, based on volunteered geographic information (VGI) generated from people tagging images uploaded by them and/or others.",1,1,,,Geomatics; Location-based service; Visual perception; Geography; Data science; Perception; Visual pollution; Urbanity; Recommender system; Knowledge management; Volunteered geographic information,,10.21433/b3112js988p1,2620533440

However, the data contributions show a geographically heterogeneous pattern around the globe. Germany counts as one of the most active countries in OSM; thus, the German street network has undergone an extensive development in recent years. The question that remains is this: How does the street network perform in a relative comparison with a commercial dataset? By means of a variety of studies, we show that the difference between the OSM street network for car navigation in Germany and a comparable proprietary dataset was only 9% in June 2011. The results of our analysis regarding the entire street network showed that OSM even exceeds the information provided by the proprietary dataset by 27%. Further analyses show on what scale errors can be reckoned with in the topology of the street network, and the completeness of turn restrictions and street name information.

This study investigates how the actual provision of cultural services is distributed across the landscape according to spatially varying relationships. The final aim was to analyse how landscape settings are associated to people’s preferences and perceptions related to cultural ecosystem services in mountain landscapes. We demonstrated a spatially explicit method based on geo-tagged images from popular social media to assess revealed preferences. A spatially weighted regression showed that specific variables correspond to prominent drivers of cultural ecosystem services at the local scale. The results of this explanatory approach can be used to integrate the cultural service dimension into land planning by taking into account specific benefiting areas and by setting priorities on the ecosystems and landscape characteristics which affect the service supply. We finally concluded that the use of crowdsourced data allows identifying spatial patterns of cultural ecosystem service preferences and their association with landscape settings.PostprintPeer reviewe,64,,237,248,Environmental resource management; Ecosystem; Spatial ecology; Land-use planning; Geography; Perception; Social media; Ecosystem services; Crowdsourcing; Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory,,10.1016/j.ecolind.2015.12.042,2262923216

Early instances of SDIs used to have limited ability to manage and process geosensor-based data (beyond remotely sensed imagery), which tend to arrive in continuous streams of real-time information. The current works on standards for Sensor Web Enablement fill this gap. This paper shows how such standards can be applied to VGI, thus converting it in a timely, cost-effective and valuable source of information for SDIs. By doing so, we extend previous efforts describing a workflow for VGI integration into SDI and further advance an initial set of VGI Sensing and event detection techniques. Examples of how such VGI Sensing techniques can support crisis information system are provided. The presented approach serves central building blocks for a Digital Earth’s nervous system, which is required to develop the next generation of (geospatial) information infrastructures.JRC.H.6-Digital Earth and Reference Dat",5,1,3,18,Digital Earth; World Wide Web; Spatial analysis; Workflow; Information system; Spatial data infrastructure; Geography; State of the Environment; Volunteered geographic information; Geospatial analysis,,10.1007/s12518-011-0056-y,2045904660

Almendros-Jiménez; Antonio Becerra-Terón,"Volunteered geographic information (VGI) makes available a very large resource of geographic data. The exploitation of data coming from such resources requires an additional effort in the form of tools and effective processing techniques. One of the most established VGI is Open Street Map (OSM) offering data of urban and rural maps from the earth. In this paper we present a library for querying OSM with XQuery. This library is based on the well-known spatial operators defined by Clementini and Egenhofer, providing a repertoire of XQuery functions which encapsulate the search on the XML document representing a layer of OSM, and make the definition of queries on top of OSM layers easy. In essence, the library is equipped with a set of OSM Operators for OSM elements which, in combination with Higher Order facilities of XQuery, facilitates the composition of queries and the definition of keyword based search geo-localized queries. OSM data are indexed by an R-tree structure, in which OSM elements are enclosed by Minimum Bounding Rectangles (MBRs), in order to get shorter answer time.",,,50,68,Information retrieval; XQuery; Open street map; Computer science; Volunteered geographic information; Bounding overwatch; Operator (computer programming); Database; XML,,10.1007/978-3-319-29589-3_4,2473165990

This, coupled with the lack of cartographic standards and the expectation to one day be able to use this vector data for more geopositionally sensitive applications, like GPS navigation, leaves potential users and researchers to question the accuracy of the database. This research takes a photogrammetric approach to determining the positional accuracy of OSM road features using stereo imagery and a vector adjustment model. The method applies rigorous analytical measurement principles to compute accurate real world geolocations of OSM road vectors. The proposed approach was tested on several urban gridded city streets from the OSM database with the results showing that the post adjusted shape points improved positionally by 86%. Furthermore, the vector adjustment was able to recover 95% of the actual positional displacement present in the database. To demonstrate a practical application, a head-to-head positional accuracy assessment between OSM, the USGS National Map (TNM), and United States Census Bureau’s Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding Referencing (TIGER) 2007 roads was conducted",2,2,276,301,Photogrammetry; Data mining; Encoding (memory); Geography; Gps navigation; Stereo imagery; Open source; The National Map; Volunteered geographic information,,10.3390/ijgi2020276,2018463030

These platforms provide volunteered geographic information (VGI), which enables the public to know where and when events occur. At the same time, image-based VGI can also indicate environmental changes and disaster conditions, such as flooding ranges and relative water levels. However, little image-based VGI has been applied for the quantification of flooding water levels because of the difficulty of identifying water lines in image-based VGI and linking them to detailed terrain models. In this study, flood detection has been achieved through image-based VGI obtained by smartphone cameras. Digital image processing and a photogrammetric method were presented to determine the water levels. In digital image processing, the random forest classification was applied to simplify ambient complexity and highlight certain aspects of flooding regions, and the HT-Canny method was used to detect the flooding line of the classified image-based VGI. Through the photogrammetric method and a fine-resolution digital elevation model based on the unmanned aerial vehicle mapping technique, the detected flooding lines were employed to determine water levels. Based on the results of image-based VGI experiments, the proposed approach identified water levels during an urban flood event in Taipei City for demonstration. Notably, classified images were produced using random forest supervised classification for a total of three classes with an average overall accuracy of 88.05%. The quantified water levels with a resolution of centimeters (&lt;3-cm difference on average) can validate flood modeling so as to extend point-basis observations to area-basis estimations. Therefore, the limited performance of image-based VGI quantification has been improved to help in flood disasters. Consequently, the proposed approach using VGI images provides a reliable and effective flood-monitoring technique for disaster management authorities.</jats:p>",12,4,706,,Flood water; Image based; Environmental science; Volunteered geographic information; Cartography,,10.3390/rs12040706,3007088614

This study proposes a VGI semantic enrichment method using linked data and thesaurus. The method has two stages, one automatic and one manual. The automatic stage links VGI contributions to places that are of interest to users. In the manual stage, a thesaurus in the hydric domain was built based on terms found in VGI.

Earlier studies assessed air pollution exposure according to travel time and city-level air pollution. The lack of spatially fine-grained travel data is a barrier to an accurate assessment of air pollution exposure. Due to a high-level spatial granularity, Strava Metro provides an opportunity to assessing air pollution exposure in combination with spatially varying air pollution concentrations. Strava Metro anonymized and aggregated a large volume of users’ traces to streets for each city. In this study, to explore the potential of crowdsourced geographic information in research of active travel and health, we used Strava Metro data and GIS technologies to assess air pollution exposure in Glasgow, UK. Particularly, we incorporated time of the trip to assess average inhaled dose of pollutant during a single cycling or pedestrian trip. Empirical results demonstrate that Strava Metro data provides an opportunity to an assessment of average air pollution exposure during active travel.

Although there is an ongoing movement towards the development of higher resolution global land cover maps, medium resolution land cover products (e.g. GLC2000 and MODIS) are still very useful for modelling and assessment purposes. However, the current land cover products are not accurate enough for many applications so we need to develop approaches that can take existing land covers maps and produce a better overall product in a hybrid approach. This paper uses geographically weighted regression (GWR) and crowdsourced validation data from Geo-Wiki to create two hybrid global land cover maps that use medium resolution land cover products as an input. Two different methods were used: (a) the GWR was used to determine the best land cover product at each location; (b) the GWR was only used to determine the best land cover at those locations where all three land cover maps disagree, using the agreement of the land cover maps to determine land cover at the other cells. The results show that the hybrid land cover map developed using the first method resulted in a lower overall disagreement than the individual global land cover maps. The hybrid map produced by the second method was also better when compared to the GLC2000 and GlobCover but worse or similar in performance to the MODIS land cover product depending upon the metrics considered. The reason for this may be due to the use of the GLC2000 in the development of GlobCover, which may have resulted in areas where both maps agree with one another but not with MODIS, and where MODIS may in fact better represent land cover in those situations. These results serve to demonstrate that spatial analysis methods can be used to improve medium resolution global land cover information with existing products.",103,,48,56,Climate change; Land cover; Geographically Weighted Regression; Medium resolution; Hybrid approach; Analysis method; Environmental science; Land use; Crowdsourcing; Remote sensing,,10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2014.06.016,2060335617

An increasing number of volunteers which add value to geospatial data require effective ways of organising and providing access to value-added or newly created data. Metadata records are often unavailable for VGI, making it problematic for users to discover data in the VGI system. This paper discusses potential approaches that can be used to create metadata for VGI. This includes Linked Data, professionally created metadata and metadata created by volunteers. The paper then discusses the shortcomings of these approaches and proposes an unconventional alternative, Geospatial Metadata 2.0. This approach involves VGI users in the creation of metadata, and builds on folksonomies created by them. The paper presents the design and implementation of this idea in a prototype system along with an assessment result. The implementation includes Geospatial Metadata 2.0 add-ons in Geonetwork, and the assessment benefits from the input of metadata experts worldwide.

Most commonly, LiDAR is used for their generation. The trade-off for the high geometric detail of these data is the low spatial coverage, comparably high costs and low actualization rates. Space-borne stereo data from Cartosat-1 is able to cover large areas on the one hand, but hold a lower geometric resolution on the other hand. In this paper we investigate to which extent the geometric shortcomings of Cartosat-1 can be overcome integrating building footprints from topographic maps for the derivation of large-area building models. Therefore, we describe the methodology to derive digital surface models from Cartosat-1 data and the derivation of building footprints from topographic maps at 1:25,000 (DTK-25). Both data is fused to generate building block models for four metropolitan regions in Germany with an area of ~16,000km². Building block models are further aggregated to 1 x 1 km grid cells and volume densities are computed. Volume densities are classified to various levels of urban mass concentrations (UMCs). Performance evaluation of the building block models reveals that building footprints are larger in the DTK-25 and building heights are lower with a mean absolute error of 3.21 m. Both factors influence the building volume which is linearly lower than the reference.

Crowd-sourcing, especially in form of Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) significantly changed the way geographic data is collected and the products that are generated from them. In VGI projects, contributors’ heterogeneity fosters rich data sources, however with problematic quality. In this paper, we tackle data quality from a classification perspective. Particularly in VGI, data classification presents some challenges: In some cases, the classification of entities depends on individual conceptualization about the environment. Whereas in other cases, a geographic feature itself might have ambiguous characteristics. These problems lead to inconsistent and inappropriate classifications. To face these challenges, we propose a guided classification approach. The approach employs data mining algorithms to develop a classifier, through investigating the geographic characteristics of target feature classes. The developed classifier acts to distinguish between related classes like forest, meadow and park. Then, the classifier could be used to guide the contributors during the classification process. The findings of an empirical study illustrate that the developed classifier correctly predict some classes. However, it still has a limited accuracy with other related classes.;                     </jats:p>",II-3/W5,,211,217,Empirical research; Information retrieval; Data quality; Data classification; Classifier (linguistics); Data mining algorithm; Geographic feature; Computer science; Volunteered geographic information; Conceptualization,,10.5194/isprsannals-ii-3-w5-211-2015,2286578449

Despite the importance of buildings for the economy and society, complete regional or even national figures of the entire building stock and its spatial distribution are still hardly available. Available digital topographic data sets created by National Mapping Agencies or mapped voluntarily through a crowd via Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) platforms (e.g. OpenStreetMap) contain building footprint information but often lack additional information on building type, usage, age or number of floors. For this reason, predictive modeling is becoming increasingly important in this context. The capabilities of machine learning allow for the prediction of building types and other building characteristics and thus, the efficient classification and description of the entire building stock of cities and regions. However, such data-driven approaches always require a sufficient amount of ground truth (reference) information for training and validation. The collection of reference data is usually cost-intensive and time-consuming. Experiences from other disciplines have shown that crowdsourcing offers the possibility to support the process of obtaining ground truth data. Therefore, this paper presents the results of an experimental study aiming at assessing the accuracy of non-expert annotations on street view images collected from an internet crowd. The findings provide the basis for a future integration of a crowdsourcing component into the process of land use mapping, particularly the automatic building classification.",1,,54,7,The Internet; Footprint; Data collection; Ground truth; Data science; Reference data (financial markets); Computer science; Topographic map; Volunteered geographic information; Crowdsourcing,,10.5194/ica-proc-1-54-2018,2804469875

However, a variety of potential biases in VGI are recognized, many of which root from volunteer data contribution activities. Examining patterns in volunteer data contribution activities helps understand the biases. Using eBird as a case study, this study investigates spatial and temporal patterns in data contribution activities of eBird contributors. eBird sampling efforts are biased in space and time. Most sampling efforts are concentrated in areas of denser populations and/or better accessibility, with the most intensively sampled areas being in proximity to big cities in developed regions of the world. Reported bird species are also spatially biased towards areas where more sampling efforts occur. Temporally, eBird sampling efforts and reported bird species are increasing over the years, with significant monthly fluctuations and notably more data reported on weekends. Such trends are driven by the expansion of eBird and characteristics of bird species and observers. The fitness of use of VGI should be assessed in the context of applications by examining spatial, temporal and other biases. Action may need to be taken to account for the biases so that robust inferences can be made from VGI observations.",9,10,597,,Geography; Volunteered geographic information; Cartography; Sampling (statistics),,10.3390/ijgi9100597,3092450323

Higher nocturnal air temperature ( T air) is associated with adverse effects on human health, higher mortality rates, and higher energy consumption. Prediction of the spatial distribution of T air is a step toward the “Smart City” concept, providing an early warning system for vulnerable populations. The study of the spatial distribution of urban T air was thus far limited by the low spatial resolution of traditional data sources. Volunteered geographic information provides alternative data with higher spatial density, with citizen weather stations monitoring T air continuously in hundreds or thousands of locations within a single city. In this article, the aim was to predict the spatial distribution of nocturnal T air in Berlin, Germany, one day in advance at a 30-m resolution using open-source remote sensing and geodata from Landsat and Urban Atlas, crowdsourced T air data, and machine learning (ML) methods. Results were tested with a “leave-one-date-out” training scheme (testingcrowd) and reference T air data (testingref). Three ML algorithms were compared—Random Forest (RF), Stochastic Gradient Boosting, and Model Averaged Neural Network. The optimal model based on accuracy and computational speed is RF, with an average root mean square error (RMSE) for testingcrowd of 1.16 °C ( R 2 = 0.512) and RMSE for testingref of 1.97 °C ( R 2 = 0.581). Overall, the most important geographic information system (GIS) predictors were morphometric parameters and albedo.

During this time, the nature of VGI has been evolving, with new types and sources of data continually being added. In light of this trend, this paper explores one such type of VGI data: Volunteered Street View Imagery (VSVI). Two VSVI sources, Mapillary and OpenStreetCam, were extracted and analyzed to study road coverage and contribution patterns for four US metropolitan areas. Results show that coverage patterns vary across sites, with most contributions occurring along local roads and in populated areas. We also found that a few users contributed most of the data. Moreover, the results suggest that most data are being collected during three distinct times of day (i.e., morning, lunch and late afternoon). The paper concludes with a discussion that while VSVI data is still relatively new, it has the potential to be a rich source of spatial and temporal information for monitoring cities.</jats:p>",9,6,341,,Metropolitan area; Geography; Late afternoon; Temporal information; Volunteered geographic information; Cartography; Crowdsourcing,,10.3390/ijgi9060341,3030624209

At the moment, the service-oriented second generation of SDI is transitioning to a third generation, which is characterized by user-centric approaches. This new movement closes the gap between classical SDI and user contributed content, also known as Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI). Public use and acquisition of information provides additional challenges within and beyond the geospatial domain. Linked Data has been suggested recently as a possible overall solution. This notion refers to a best practice for exposing, sharing, and connecting resources in the (Semantic) Web. This chapter details the Linked Data approach to SDI and suggests it as a possibility to combine SDI with VGI. Thus, a Spatial Linked Data Infrastructure could apply solutions for Linked Data to classical SDI standards.

Volunteered geographical information, in particular OpenStreetMap (OSM), shows great potential in providing the knowledge of human settlements to support humanitarian aid, while the availability and quality of OSM remains a major concern. The majority of existing works in assessing OSM data quality focus on either extrinsic or intrinsic analysis, which is insufficient to fulfill the humanitarian mapping scenario to a certain degree. This paper aims to explore OSM missing built-up areas from an integrative perspective of social sensing and remote sensing. First, applying hierarchical DBSCAN clustering algorithm, the clusters of geo-tagged tweets are generated as proxies of human active regions. Then a deep learning based model fine-tuned on existing OSM data is proposed to further map the missing built-up areas. Hit by Cyclone Idai and Kenneth in 2019, the Republic of Mozambique is selected as the study area to evaluate the proposed method at a national scale.

Starting from the links between smart city concept and human-centered development and moving on to the definition of multidimensional poverty, the literature indicates that there is a need for an orchestrated design of smart city applications for alleviating poverty in its wider sense, based on strong theoretical foundations. The study indicates that a volunteered geographic information (VGI) concept, alongside with a 3-level data structure, should be treated as integral parts of the proposed application structure that uses the human-centered theoretical approach as a baseline to alleviate poverty. The 3-level data structure encompasses a wide range of indicators, referring not only to demographic and spatiotemporal variables, but also covers all essential information for measuring multidimensional poverty index (MPI).

Ballard; Lucy D. Robinson; Alison Young; Gregory B. Pauly; Lila Higgins; Rebecca F. Johnson; John C. Tweddle,"Abstract Through their unique combination of specimen collections, scientific and public education expertise, and wide audience reach and trust, natural history museums (NHMs) are obvious settings for bridging conservation science and education through citizen science. Building on over 100 years of amateur naturalist contributions to biodiversity science, a wide range of NHM-based citizen science programs have emerged recently. Yet no comparative studies of the conservation outcomes of this work exist. Here we ask, what is the evidence that NHM citizen science contributes to conservation, what kinds of programs and strategies do so, and how could this approach be better realized for conservation goals? We analyzed 44 citizen science programs across three museums (one U.K., two U.S.) to assess whether and how they contribute to conservation-relevant outcomes. We found evidence that they support conservation both directly, through site and species management, and indirectly through research, education and policy impacts. This study has implications for understanding the role NHMs can play in maximizing the socio-ecological impacts of citizen science, including bringing citizen science to new audiences, mobilizing volunteers to collect and analyze data to study species invasions and impacts of global changes, and conducting locally-relevant research in urban systems. NHM citizen science can provide multiple entry-points and levels of engagement for participants in science and access to new means of studying biodiversity, both in the field and virtually. From our findings we recommend collaboration among the research and education staff within NHMs and other similar conservation organizations, as well as partnerships with external organizations to successfully contribute to conservation outcomes.",208,,87,97,Environmental resource management; Natural history; Political science; Natural resource management; Citizen science; Amateur; Digitization; Public education; Specimen collection; Public relations; Naturalism,,10.1016/j.biocon.2016.08.040,2530451737

Volunteered geographic information has only recently started to be used by managers to examine patterns of trail use in reserves.

Therefore, we compared how mountain bikers, runners and walkers use popular reserves (Daisy Hill Conservation Park, Venman Bushland National Park and Bayview Conservation Area) close to Brisbane, Australia, based on extracted route data from the fitness tracking application MapMyFitness. Routes for all three activity types were displayed and analysed using ArcGIS. Mountain biking was more popular (49% of the 948 routes), than walking (27%) or running (24%) across the three reserves. Route data was effective at predicting the relative popularity of specific trails with significant linear regressions when compared with fixed-point trail counts (R2 = 0.681). Bikers went further, used a greater range of trail combinations and used more reserves per trip than the other two activities. Weekends were popular for all three activities, but more so for biking (57%), than walking (44%), or running (43%). The results highlight how volunteered geographic information complements other trail data allowing urban planners and managers to better assess visitor movements in reserves.

Mapping the distribution of poverty in developing countries is essential for humanitarian organizations and policymakers to formulate targeted programs and aid. However, traditional methods for obtaining socioeconomic data can be time-consuming, expensive, and labor-intensive. Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of combining machine learning and satellite images to estimate wealth in sub-Saharan African countries (Xie et al., 2016, Jean et al., 2016). In this study, we investigate the extent to which this method can be applied in the context of the Philippine archipelago to predict four different socioeconomic indicators: wealth level, years of education, access to electricity, and access to water. We also propose an alternative, cost-effective approach that leverages a combination of volunteered geographic information from OpenStreetMap and nighttime lights satellite imagery for estimating socioeconomic indicators. The best models, which incorporate regional indicators as predictors, explain approximately 63% of the variation in asset-based wealth. Our findings also indicate that models trained on publicly available, volunteer-curated geographic data achieve the same predictive performance as that of models trained using proprietary satellite images.;                     </jats:p>",XLII-4/W19,,425,431,Deep learning; Machine learning; Socioeconomic status; Transfer of learning; Artificial intelligence; Poverty; Geography; Satellite imagery; Volunteered geographic information; Developing country; Geospatial analysis,,10.5194/isprs-archives-xlii-4-w19-425-2019,2997208123

Studies have analysed the quality of volunteered geographic information (VGI) datasets, assessing the positional accuracy of features and the completeness of specific attributes. While it has been shown that VGI can, in some context, reach a high positional accuracy, these works have also highlighted a large spatial heterogeneity in positional accuracy, completeness but also with regards to the semantics of the objects. Such high semantic heterogeneity of VGI datasets becomes a significant obstacle to a number of possible uses that could be made of the data. This paper proposes an approach for both improving the semantic quality and reducing the semantic heterogeneity of VGI dat asets. The improvement of the semantic quality is achieved by automatically suggesting attributes to contributors during the editing process. The reduction of semantic heterogeneity is achieved by automatically notifying contributors when two attributes are too similar or too dissimilar. The approach was implemented into a plugin for OpenStreetMap and different examples illustrate how this plugin can be used to improve the quality of VGI data.",XL-2/W1,1,143,148,Semantics; Semantic similarity; Spatial heterogeneity; Information retrieval; Data quality; Semantic heterogeneity; Completeness (statistics); Computer science; Plug-in; Volunteered geographic information,,10.5194/isprsarchives-xl-2-w1-143-2013,2165445075

This analysis uses VGI describing land cover that was captured using a web-based interface, linked to Google Earth. A number of control points, for which the land cover had been determined by experts allowed measures of the reliability of each volunteer in relation to each land cover class to be calculated. Geographically weighted kernels were used to estimate surfaces of volunteered land cover information accuracy and then to develop spatially distributed correspondences between the volunteer land cover class and land cover from 3 contemporary global datasets (GLC-2000, GlobCover and MODIS v.5). Specifically, a geographically weighted approach calculated local confusion matrices (correspondences) at each location in a central African study area and generated spatial distributions of user's, producer's, portmanteau, and partial portmanteau accuracies. These were used to evaluate the global datasets and to infer which of them was ‘best’ at describing Tree cover at each location in the study area. The resulting maps show where specific global datasets are recommended for analyses requiring Tree cover information. The methods presented in this research suggest that some of the concerns about the quality of VGI can be addressed through careful data collection, the use of control points to evaluate volunteer performance and spatially explicit analyses.

H. van Vliet; Willem Takken,"Tick populations and tick-borne infections have steadily increased since the mid-1990s posing an ever-increasing risk to public health. Yet, modelling tick dynamics remains challenging because of the lack of data and knowledge on this complex phenomenon. Here we present an approach to model and map tick dynamics using volunteered data. This approach is illustrated with 9 years of data collected by a group of trained volunteers who sampled active questing ticks (AQT) on a monthly basis and for 15 locations in the Netherlands. We aimed at finding the main environmental drivers of AQT at multiple time-scales, and to devise daily AQT maps at the national level for 2014. Tick dynamics is a complex ecological problem driven by biotic (e.g. pathogens, wildlife, humans) and abiotic (e.g. weather, landscape) factors. We enriched the volunteered AQT collection with six types of weather variables (aggregated at 11 temporal scales), three types of satellite-derived vegetation indices, land cover, and mast years. Then, we applied a feature engineering process to derive a set of 101 features to characterize the conditions that yielded a particular count of AQT on a date and location. To devise models predicting the AQT, we use a time-aware Random Forest regression method, which is suitable to find non-linear relationships in complex ecological problems, and provides an estimation of the most important features to predict the AQT. We trained a model capable of fitting AQT with reduced statistical metrics. The multi-temporal study on the feature importance indicates that variables linked to water levels in the atmosphere (i.e. evapotranspiration, relative humidity) consistently showed a higher explanatory power than previous works using temperature. As a product of this study, we are able of mapping daily tick dynamics at the national level. This study paves the way towards the design of new applications in the fields of environmental research, nature management, and public health. It also illustrates how Citizen Science initiatives produce geospatial data collections that can support scientific analysis, thus enabling the monitoring of complex environmental phenomena.",16,1,1,15,Environmental resource management; Random forest; Vegetation; Citizen science; Geography; Temporal scales; Feature engineering; Land cover; Geographic Mapping; Geospatial analysis,Data analysis; Environmental modelling; Random forest; Tick dynamics; Volunteered geographic information (VGI),10.1186/s12942-017-0114-8,2768197086

With the growth and advancements in mobile technologies, the Internet, and Web 2.0 technologies users are not only consumers of news, but also producers of online content. This has resulted in a novel and highly participatory cyber-physical news awareness ecosystem that fosters digital activism, in which volunteers contribute content to online communities. While studies have examined the various components of this news awareness ecosystem, little is still known about how news media coverage (and in particular digital media) impacts digital activism. In order to address this challenge and develop a greater understanding of it, this paper focuses on a specific form of digital activism, that of the production of digital geographical content through crowdsourcing efforts. Using refugee camps from around the world as a case study, we examine the relationship between news coverage (via Google news), search trends (via Google trends) and user edit contribution patterns in OpenStreetMap, a prominent geospatial data crowdsourcing platform. In addition, we compare and contrast these patterns with user edit patterns in Wikipedia, a well-known non-geospatial crowdsourcing platform. Using Google news and Google trends to derive a measure of thematic public awareness, our findings indicate that digital activism bursts tend to take place during periods of sustained build-up of public awareness deficit or surplus. These findings are in line with two prominent mass communication theories: agenda setting and corrective action, and suggest the emergence of a novel stimulus-awareness-activism framework in today's participatory digital age. Moreover, these findings further complement existing research examining the motivational factors that drive users to contribute to online collaborative communities.

This paper proposes an approach to addressing the technical challenge of propagating updates from timely sources (e.g. OpenStreetMap) to spatial data maintained at separate map scales. The main idea is to establish a multiple representation database (MRDB) for datasets at different scales and time to facilitate incremental update, where linkages between corresponding objects at different datasets are made explicit. First, two ways in which the timely sources can be integrated into official data for incremental update are discussed. To derive the linkages between different datasets, a data matching procedure based on computer vision is presented and fine-tuned to match data in different scale ranges. Furthermore, the generalization history used to produce smaller scale data from the larger ones in official data is inferred based on the linkages, and is then used to guide the update propagation. Finally, a framework for incremental generalization in MRDBs is proposed, where crucial issues like strategies for update propagation, cartographic generalization, and the so-called ‘chain reaction’ are addressed. The framework is implemented as a fully automated process where operators like simplification, enlargement, compression, displacement and typification are incorporated into the incremental update process. By testing the framework against real world data sets (i.e. OpenStreetMap and official data at 1:10k, 1:50k and 1:100k), we show that the updates are integrated consistently into existing data in terms of spatial relations and cartographic quality. Our work suggests that making use of timely sources by official mapping agencies and companies in a continuous or event-driven data update is technically feasible, with further improvement and extensions discussed.",72,,42,56,Spatial analysis; Cartographic generalization; Information retrieval; Spatial relation; Data matching; Computer science; Scale (map); Volunteered geographic information; Linkage (mechanical); Operator (computer programming),,10.1016/j.jag.2018.05.022,2805300062

Spielman,"Collective intelligence is the idea that under the right circumstances collections of individuals are smarter than even the smartest individuals in the group, that is a group has an “intelligence” that is independent of the intelligence of its members. The ideology of collective intelligence undergirds much of the enthusiasm about the use of “volunteered” or crowd-sourced geographic information. Literature from a variety of fields makes clear that not all groups possess collective intelligence, this article identifies four pre-conditions for the emergence of collective intelligence and then examines the extent to which collectively generated mapping systems satisfy these conditions. However, the “intelligence” collectively generated maps is hard to assess because there are two difficult to reconcile perspectives on map quality – the credibility perspective and the accuracy perspective. Much of the current literature on user-generated maps focuses on assessing the quality of individual contributions.

From the popular OpenStreetMap (OSM) to many citizen science projects and social network platforms, the amount of geographically referenced information that is constantly being generated by citizens is burgeoning. The main issue that continues to hamper the full exploitation of VGI lies in its quality, which is by its nature typically undocumented and can range from very high quality to very poor. A crucial step towards improving VGI quality, which impacts on VGI usability, is the development and adoption of protocols, guidelines and best practices to assist users when collecting VGI. This chapter proposes a generic and flexible protocol for VGI data collection, which can be applied to new as well as to existing projects regardless of the specific type of geospatial information collected. The protocol is meant to balance the contrasting needs of providing VGI contributors with precise and detailed instructions while maintaining and growing the enthusiasm and motivation of contributors. Two real-world applications of the protocol are presented, which guide the collection of VGI in respectively the generation and updating of thematic information in a topographic building database; and the uploading of geotagged photographs for the improvement of land use and land cover maps. Technology is highlighted as a key factor in determining the success of the protocol implementation.",,,223,247,Data collection; Usability; Best practice; Citizen science; Data quality; Data science; Computer science; Volunteered geographic information; Social network; Geospatial analysis,,10.5334/bbf.j,2755883469

It provides a platform that all the registered members coming from different areas in the world can cooperate with each other to mapping our world. Besides, OSM attracts more and more people, companies and even the governmental agencies because of its free and open source. Studies have proofed that both the quantity and quality of OSM data in several western countries, i.e. Germany, France and the Netherland are even better than the authority data. In recent years, the quantity of the OSM data and the number of contributors in China increased rapidly, but the overall distribution of OSM data is very fit with the distribution of population and the economic development and it displays an uneven development in different provinces and cities in China. Besides, the state of the OSM in China is just similar to that in Germany in 2010 in terms of data quantity and quality, although China is about 25 times to Germany regarding land area and the smartphone penetration in China and Germany does not have a large distance (51.7&amp;amp;thinsp;% to 68.8&amp;amp;thinsp;%). Why is the development of OSM in China so poor and backward when comparing that with western countries, although the environment in hardware and software in China are similar to the western countries? Attempting to answer this question, this paper presents a user survey in China. Mainly, knowledges and experiences about OSM and OSM contribution were asked in the user survey. The user survey was conducted both by paper and pen and by using online platform. Totally, over 1200 participants with the age range from 15 to 80 and a huge diverse of background took part in the user survey.

However, the spatial patterns of, and level of mix between tourist and local attractions have remained largely unknown. Taking advantage of the recent development in volunteered geographic information, we used Flickr data to examine how tourists and locals' destinations overlap spatially. We combined a density-based spatial clustering algorithm, a dissimilarity index, spatial scan statistics, and location-based tag clouds to explore the potential spatial and social interactions between tourists and local residents in ten US cities: Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, New York City, Orlando, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington, D.C.. At the city-level, we report the spatial distributions of visitors' and locals' destinations and compare the overall level of segregation between the two groups. Within each city, we identify the hotspots for visitors and locals and investigate the semantic content for reasons behind visiting specific places.

Contributors to a VGI project are normally free to choose whatever tags they feel are appropriate to annotate or describe a particular geographic object or place. In OpenStreetMap (OSM), the Map Features part of the OSM Wiki serves as the de-facto rulebook or ontology for the annotation of features in OSM. Within Map Features, suggestions and guidance on what combinations of tags to use for certain geographic objects are outlined. In this paper, we consider these suggestions and recommendations and analyse the OSM database for 40 cities around the world to ascertain if contributors to OSM in these urban areas are using this guidance in their tagging practices. Overall, we find that compliance with the suggestions and guidance in Map Features is generally average or poor.

A recent advance in this direction has been the GlobeLand30 dataset derived from Landsat imagery, which has been developed by the National Geomatics Center of China (NGCC). Although overall accuracy is greater than 80%, the NGCC would like help in assessing the accuracy of the product in different regions of the world. To assist in this process, this study compares the GlobeLand30 product with existing public and online datasets, that is, CORINE, Urban Atlas (UA), OpenStreetMap, and ATKIS for Germany in order to assess overall and per class agreement. The results of the analysis reveal high agreement of up to 92% between these datasets and GlobeLand30 but that large disagreements for certain classes are evident, in particular wetlands.

While earlier studies have suggested a potential relationship between VGI quality and population density or socio-economic characteristics of an area, such relationships have not been rigorously explored, and mainly remained qualitative in nature. This paper addresses this gap by quantifying the relationship between demographic properties of a given area and the quality of VGI contributions. We study specifically the demographic characteristics of the mapped area and its relation to two dimensions of spatial data quality, namely positional accuracy and completeness of the corresponding VGI contributions with respect to OSM using the Denver (Colorado, US) area as a case study. We use non-spatial and spatial analysis techniques to identify potential associations among demographics data and the distribution of positional and completeness errors found within VGI data. Generally, the results of our study show a lack of statistically significant support for the assumption that demographic properties affect the positional accuracy or completeness of VGI. While this research is focused on a specific area, our results showcase the complex nature of the relationship between VGI quality and demographics, and highlights the need for a better understanding of it.

Recent advances in information technology have made geographic information system (GIS) a powerful and affordable tool for planning and decision making in various fields such as the public transportation. These technologies such as the social network (e.g. face-book, twitter), new technologies such as ubiquitous, mobile, Web 2.0, geo tagging and RFID can help to create better shapes and forms of the communication and geo-collaboration for public. By using these, user-generated content and spatial information can be easily and quickly produced and shared in a dynamic, interactive, multimedia and distributed environment. The concept of volunteered geographic information (VGI) has been introduced by the transaction from consultation to content interaction. VGI describes any type of content that has a geographic element and has been voluntarily collected. In other words, ordinary users; without a professional training, can participate in generating and using the spatial information. As a result, the gaps between the producers and users of GIS and spatial information, has been considerably reduced. Public transportation is one of the most important elements of the transportation system. Rapid growth of the cities has resulted in high increase of demand for the public transportation which created new challenges. Improvement of the desirability of public transportation can increase its efficiency, reduction of the environmental pollution (such as air and noise pollution), traffic problems, and fuel consumption. Hence, development of an urban public transportation system which is responsive to citizen's need and motivates them to use public transportation system is one of the most important objectives and issues that urban planners and designers are concerned about. One solution to achieve this, goal is to develop public transportation system by assistance from the system users. According to approach, users are considered as the valuable resources, because people who are in constant contact with the system can have detailed and updated information about the problems, solutions and they are affected by the related implemented policies. Thus user involvement is an essential part in public transport decision making process. Although GIS in transportation (GIS-T) has been used for data collection, spatial analysis, and spatial modeling, due to recent promotions, GIS-T is moving towards the use of capabilities of VGI to user-centric services. The main goals of this paper are two as follows: First is to survey and review the key concepts of the geo-collaboration, to introduce and present fields to utilizing the VGI in the public transportation system to improve the performance of that system. The Second goal is to propose a VGI-based public transport conceptual framework. in this paper in the first part capabilities of VGI is explored, and areas of public transport that can utilize the public involvement is assessed and classified. Then, by surveying the related works in this context, a classification based on the models of participation is provided. Finally, a VGI-based conceptual framework for organizing a public participation for performance measurement of urban public transport for Tehran city is proposed. Results of this paper show that utilizing VGI presents an efficient solution for public transport problems.",XL-1/W3,,425,430,GIS and public health; Information technology; Engineering; Conceptual framework; Transport engineering; Public participation; Environmental pollution; Geographic information system; Public transport; Volunteered geographic information,,10.5194/isprsarchives-xl-1-w3-425-2013,2019052053

Wartmann; Ross S. Purves,"Participatory mapping of local land use as the basis for planning and decision-making has become widespread around the globe. However, still relatively little is known about the conceptual underpinnings of geographic information produced through participatory mapping in given cultural and linguistic settings. In this paper, we therefore address the seemingly simple question of what is (not) represented on maps through an exploratory case study comparing land use categories participants represented on sketch maps with categories elicited through more language-focused ethnographic fieldwork. To explore landscape categorization, we conducted sketch mapping with 29 participants and in-depth ethnographic fieldwork with 19 participants from the Takana indigenous people in the Bolivian Amazon. Sketch mapping resulted in 74 different feature types, while we elicited 156 landscape categories used in language, of which only 23 overlapped with feature types from the sketch mapping. Vegetation categories were highly diversified in language but seldom represented on maps, while more obviously anthropogenic features were represented on sketch maps. Furthermore, participants seldom drew culturally important landscape categories such as fallow plots or important plant harvesting sites on maps, with important potential consequences for natural resource management",6,4,79,,Cognitive map; Natural resource management; Geography; Globe; Sketch; Natural resource; Land use; Indigenous; Cartography; Categorization,,10.3390/land6040079,2767027393

Juarez; Marco Moreno; Miguel Torres-Ruiz,"Environmental noise, as well as being a form of environmental pollution that affects mainly urban areas, it is a problem that involves people's quality of life. This paper presents a methodology that takes advantage of the Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) in obtaining georeferenced environmental noise maps and the corresponding statistics for a particular area of interest. The methodology herein presented considers the phases of Data acquisition, Analysis and data processing, and Visualization of the information. The design and development of a Geographic Information System is presented, which consists of a web mapping application, an application for mobile devices, called NoiseMonitor, Geospatial Analysis and Machine Learning methods (Support Vector Machines and Artificial Neural Networks) for acoustic noise prediction using contextual information, that is, some factors around the measurements.

Moreover, limited maintenance budgets prevalent in these countries make it difficult for organizations to conduct regular systematic updates of geographic information. For a LAS to remain useful, it must reflect realities on the ground, and this can only be achieved if land information is reported regularly. However, if changes in the land are not captured in properly administered land registers, LAS lose societal relevance and are eventually replaced by informal systems. Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) can address these challenges by providing a timely, affordable, flexible, inclusive, up-to-date, and fit for purpose land information to support the limited current systems. However, the consideration and integration of such external sources relies on the quality and credibility of contributed datasets by the public. The public whom in most cases are non-geographic experts can contribute datasets of varying quality and detail, resulting in the reluctance of officials to utilize VGI in their databases. Therefore, this study proposes a Kappa statistical measure methodology: a consensus-based measure of agreement to establish ‘proxy’ quality and credibility of VGI. The methodology was successfully implemented in a case study of Botswana to demonstrate its effectiveness in establishing trust and confidence of contributed datasets by the public. The innovative approach to Kappa presented here, minimizes the need for ground truthing of VGI data.",28,3,299,311,Proxy (climate); Business; Ground truth; Data science; Land administration; Fleiss' kappa; Kappa; Credibility; Volunteered geographic information; Developing country,,10.1007/s41324-019-00289-7,2971701529

This is especially true for young people, who interact with these technologies on a daily basis. Therefore, it is essential that these potential map users possess sufficient knowledge and skills to process the content of cartographic products. A user study was conducted during which pupils (aged 11-18years) and geography students (>18years) had to solve a number of cartography questions using topographic maps. The data were analyzed statistically, taking into account a number of potentially influencing factors (user characteristics) on the participants' results: age, gender, youth club membership, knowledge about the area, among others. The results show a rising trend in the pupils' scores with increasing age, which can be explained by education in cartography at school. Geography students perform much better, but no influence of any other user characteristics was detected. For pupils, knowledge about the area and gender might be considered as influencing factors.

Hochmair,"Finding a scenic route between two locations is a common trip-planning task, in particular for tourists and recreational travelers. For the automated computation of a scenic route in a trip-planning system to function, it is necessary to understand which attributes of a route and its surroundings are associated with attractive scenery. One way to find this information is with a route choice model framework, which requires a choice set of realistic paths for traveling a scenic route. This paper proposes a constrained enumeration type algorithm for computing scenic alternatives with a branch-and-bound approach and a labeling algorithm in combination with link elimination to generate a scenic route choice set. These algorithms use volunteered geographic information—shared, geotagged photos (photos to which geographical identification metadata have been added) from Panoramio—to generate path alternatives.

Through a literature review and content analysis this article traces the emergence of volunteered geographic information (VGI), and identifies the recurrent use of several related binaries to contrast this phenomenon with the conventional spatial data production activities of states and corporations. Using several key examples, these binaries are deconstructed by identifying a mismatch in how VGI is conceptualized (bottom-up, amateur, asserted) in the literature and the reality of existing VGI projects. As an alternative to a binary conceptualization of spatial data production, a different representation is put forward that more accurately depicts what is in actuality a vast, shifting, and heterogeneous landscape of spatial data production approaches. Thinking about contemporary spatial data production not as a binary but as a continuum could encourage the development of hybridities that harness the benefits of different approaches—including the oversight and quality control of conventional methods, with the speed, low cost, and distributed nature of citizen-based spatial data production.; ; ; ; Deconstruire les valeurs binaires de la production de donnees spatiales: vers l'hybridite; Resume; ; Les nombres binaires, l'expression la plus simple de la categorisation, sont utiles pour caracteriser les phenomenes emergents ; pourtant, ils font l'objet de nombreuses critiques liees a leur conception simpliste du monde et a leur emploi comme moyen d'exercer une influence sociale et politique.

Crowdsourcing such information on urgent needs in a disaster can improve the quick emergency responses. This study incorporates the capability of smartphone sensors, GPS, Web 2.0, VGI, and server-based technologies to design and develop a system for collecting target hazard information from volunteers. One of the most important contributions in designing this system is considering the improvement of the positional accuracy of the target buildings based on the position of the mobile device. Several approaches have been recommended for this purpose. The solutions include the use of online map services, geocoding services, and trigonometric methods based on the measurements of sensors such as camera, accelerometer, and magnetic field embedded in a smart mobile phone. The accuracy assessment showed that the trigonometric method by the means of embedded sensors would yield the best result. However, geocoding is more economical in terms of time than other methods.

Examples are the ‘Einzelfall-Map’ or earlier maps that were designed to show refugee infrastructure but doubled for use in planning attacks on refugees. A closer inspection of these maps shows the use of simplified and generalized language, disrespect for the rule of law and human rights, and xenophobic metaphorical language. While these characteristics are used not only by right-wing movements (they can also be identified in left-wing anti-globalization discourse), right-wing movements tend to use spatial language more often than other political tendencies. This paper analyses language used by rightwing populists in maps that are based on volunteered geographic information – as for example in the ‘Einzelfall-Map’. The analysis of the contents of the map, based on the ‘syndrome approach’, presents the various discourses that circulate around the topic ‘right-wing populism’. This analysis contributes to the development of teaching strategies that unearth the explicitly geographic language used by populist ideologies.",1,,36,48,Ideology; Human rights; Refugee; Rule of law; Media studies; Social media; Populism; Volunteered geographic information; Politics,,10.1553/giscience2017_02_s36,2772099977

Bishop,"<jats:p>High density residential development in metropolitan Melbourne, where contradictory imperatives of neighbourhood character and urban intensification play important roles, remains an uncertain practice. One key issue for plan implementation is the lack of consistency between authorities, developers and the community in interpreting the standards, design guidelines, and state/local strategies, especially those relating to neighbourhood character. There is currently no mechanism to incorporate community perceptions and place experiences as subjective aspects of neighbourhood character in development assessments. There is also little use of micro-scale and multi-dimensional spatial analysis to integrate these subjective aspects with objective measures (e.g. building volume and height; streetscape) to communicate effectively—and in a limited timeframe—with all stakeholders. This paper explores the potential of two emerging geospatial technologies that can be leveraged to respond to these problems. Evidence in the literature suggests that volunteered geographic information (VGI) can provide community input around subjective aspects of the urban environment. In addition, a deluge of three-dimensional (3D) spatial information (e.g. 3D city models) is increasingly available for micro-level (building- or property-level) assessment of the physical aspects of the urban environment. This paper formulates and discusses a conceptual framework to link these two spatial technological advancements in a virtual geographic environment (VGE) that accounts for micro-scale 3D spatial analysis incorporating both subjective and objective aspects of neighbourhood character relevant in implementing compact city strategies.</jats:p>",1,2,32,48,Conceptual framework; Civil engineering; Spatial analysis; Geography; 3D city models; Compact city; Urban studies; Neighbourhood character; Volunteered geographic information; Environmental planning; Geospatial analysis,,10.17645/up.v1i2.623,2444002369

However, such information is often missing, incomplete or not up-to-date in digital maps due to the high cost, e.g., time and money, for data acquisition and updating. In this study we propose a crowdsourced method that harnesses the light-weight GPS tracks from commuting vehicles as Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) for traffic regulator detection. We explore the novel idea of detecting traffic regulators by learning the movement patterns of vehicles at regulated locations. Vehicles’ movement behavior was encoded in the form of speed-profiles, where both speed values and their sequential order during movement development were used as features in a three-class classification problem for the most common traffic regulators: traffic-lights, priority-signs and uncontrolled junctions. The method provides an average weighting function and a majority voting scheme to tolerate the errors in the VGI data. The sequence-to-sequence framework requires no extra overhead for data processing, which makes the method applicable for real-world traffic regulator detection tasks. The results showed that the deep-learning classifier Conditional Variational Autoencoder can predict regulators with 90% accuracy, outperforming a random forest classifier (88% accuracy) that uses the summarized statistics of movement as features. In our future work images and augmentation techniques can be leveraged to generalize the method’s ability for classifying a greater variety of traffic regulator classes.",9,11,652,,Autoencoder; Deep learning; Machine learning; Data processing; Artificial intelligence; Random forest; Digital mapping; Weighting; Classifier (linguistics); Computer science; Volunteered geographic information,,10.3390/ijgi9110652,3097495256

González,"The estimation of commuting flows at different spatial scales is a fundamental problem for different areas of study. Many current methods rely on parameters requiring calibration from empirical trip volumes. Their values are often not generalizable to cases without calibration data. To solve this problem we develop a statistical expression to calculate commuting trips with a quantitative functional form to estimate the model parameter when empirical trip data is not available. We calculate commuting trip volumes at scales from within a city to an entire country, introducing a scaling parameter alpha to the recently proposed parameter free radiation model. The model requires only widely available population and facility density distributions. The parameter can be interpreted as the influence of the region scale and the degree of heterogeneity in the facility distribution. We explore in detail the scaling limitations of this problem, namely under which conditions the proposed model can be applied without trip data for calibration. On the other hand, when empirical trip data is available, we show that the proposed model's estimation accuracy is as good as other existing models.

A highly relevant phenomenon is therefore the so-called citizen observatories whereby the observations of ordinary citizens, and not just those of professionals and scientists, are included in earth observation and environmental management. Advanced citizen observatories can enable a two-way communication paradigm between citizens and decision makers, potentially resulting in profound changes to local environmental management processes and, as such, in social innovation processes and outcomes. This paper analyses the social innovation potential of such ICT-enabled citizen observatories to increase eParticipation in local flood risk management. The findings from empirical research in two case study locations highlight the divergent roles that authorities conceive for citizens and the role(s) that citizens in practice assign to themselves. Moreover, given the institutional structures identified in these cases and the obligation of authorities to be accountable for their decisions, citizen observatories do not automatically imply that citizens will have a higher level of participation in flood risk management, nor that communication between stakeholders improves.",42,,187,198,Empirical research; Business; Obligation; Social innovation; Flood risk management; Institutional structure; Public relations; Phenomenon; Information and Communications Technology; Big data,,10.1016/j.techsoc.2015.05.002,787719797

Unfortunately, Mexico is one of the countries with the highest unrecorded crime rates worldwide. So, according to different unofficial reports, in 2016, the unrecorded crime rate for common jurisdiction crimes was greater than 90%. Thus, it is not possible to define an efficient decision-making process because the real number of crimes, specially the specific geographic location of these crimes, is not known. In 2016, the official INEGI reported two main factors that contribute with the unrecorded crime rate: corruption and lack of confidence (victim personal information) provided from government security institutions. In recent years, several web and mobile applications have been developed, based on volunteered geographic information scheme to collect criminal anonymous information related to this issue. However, the point to define methodologies that allow us to identify multiple records related to the same crime event is necessary. The main goal of this chapter is to generate public policies and guidelines to improve the administration of justice, taking into consideration certain values of criminal incidence, along with a clear identification of kinds of events presented. Thus, this chapter is oriented to generate statistical data by applying ITC technologies to produce both good and safety policies. In addition to this, a case study focused on the application of artificial intelligence algorithms to analyze and classify crime reports is presented as well.",,,241,262,Internet privacy; Public policy; Business; Government; Security policy; Personally identifiable information; Corruption; Jurisdiction; Administration of justice; Volunteered geographic information,,10.1016/b978-0-12-816639-0.00014-4,2951837345

Geo-tagged photographs are sometimes presented to volunteers as part of a game which requires them to extract relevant facts about land use. The challenge is to select the most relevant photographs in order to most efficiently extract the useful information while maintaining the engagement and interests of volunteers. By repurposing an existing network which had been trained on an extensive library of potentially relevant features, we can quickly carry out initial assessments of the general value of this approach, pick out especially salient features, and identify focus areas for future neural network training and development. We compare two approaches to extract land cover information from the network: a simple post hoc weighting approach accessible to non-technical audiences and a more complex decision tree approach that involves training on domain-specific features of interest. Both approaches had reasonable success in characterizing human influence within a scene when identifying the land use types (as classified by Urban Atlas) present within a buffer around the photograph’s location. This work identifies important limitations and opportunities for using volunteered photographs as follows: (1) the false precision of a photograph’s location is less useful for identifying on-the-spot land cover than the information it can give on neighbouring combinations of land cover; (2) ground-acquired photographs, interpreted by a neural network, can supplement plan view imagery by identifying features which will never be discernible from above; (3) when dealing with contexts where there are very few exemplars of particular classes, an independent a posteriori weighting of existing scene attributes and categories can buffer against over-specificity.",20,3,252,268,Deep learning; Machine learning; Artificial intelligence; Weighting; Land cover; Salient; Computer science; Land use; Repurposing; Convolutional neural network; Decision tree,,10.1080/10095020.2017.1373955,2755090963

OSM aims to create a free digital map of the world and is implemented through the engagement of participants in a mode similar to software development in Open Source projects. The information is collected by many participants, collated on a central database, and distributed in multiple digital formats through the World Wide Web. This type of information was termed 'Volunteered Geographical Information' (VG!) by Goodchild, 2007. However, to date there has been no systematic analysis of the quality of VGI. This study aims to fill this gap by analysing OSM information. The examination focuses on analysis of its quality through a comparison with Ordnance Survey (OS) datasets. The analysis focuses on London and England, since OSM started in London in August 2004 and therefore the study of these geographies provides the best understanding of the achievements and difficulties of VGI. The analysis shows that OSM information can be fairly accurate: on average within about 6 m of the position recorded by the OS, and with approximately 80% overlap of motorway objects between the two datasets. In the space of four years, OSM has captured about 29% of the area of England, of which approximately 24% are digitised lines without a complete set of attributes.

It is necessary to continually extract current road structure, as it changes rapidly with the development of the city. Due to the success of semantic segmentation based on deep learning in the application of computer vision, extracting road networks from VHR (Very High Resolution) imagery becomes a method of updating geographic databases. The major shortcoming of deep learning methods for road networks extraction is that they need a massive amount of high quality pixel-wise training datasets, which is hard to obtain. Meanwhile, a large amount of different types of VGI (volunteer geographic information) data including road centerline has been accumulated in the past few decades. However, most road centerlines in VGI data lack precise width information and, therefore, cannot be directly applied to conventional supervised deep learning models. In this paper, we propose a novel weakly supervised method to extract road networks from VHR images using only the OSM (OpenStreetMap) road centerline as training data instead of high quality pixel-wise road width label. Large amounts of paired Google Earth images and OSM data are used to validate the approach.

They can also generate data by themselves with their applications in cyber worlds like Google Earth. This study is primarily designed to be a guide regarding Volunteered Geographical Information (VGI) and to evaluate the geometric accuracy of data collected from volunteers on application. The main purpose of this study is to present basic information about Volunteered Geographical Information (VGI), why users are tending to use VGI, the accuracy of the data entered by the user, to examine the examples of use in various fields, to learn about geographic information systems and to compare this phenomenon and also by developing a VGI application to examine the similarity between the actual data and the data collected from volunteer users. A mobile and web-based application have been developed to collect traffic accident data from volunteer users.

LTER data are used to describe the state and dynamics of an ecosystem. This valuable research is in charge of experts in ecology, and it is performed in the so-called LTER networks (for Europe, see http://www.lter-europe.net), usually organized at a national level; they consist of sites covering different ecosystem typologies, each one with research and monitoring facilities. In summer 2015, researchers of the Italian LTER network (LTER-Italy) have created a set of naturalistic trails, connecting sites of LTER-Italy (http://www.lteritalia.it/cammini), aiming to transfer and share the research results with citizens, through public events and informal science communication. Along one of these trails, performed on the Alps, the organizers proposed the use of two VGI apps to collect either biological or abiotic observations (http://www.lteritalia.it/it/content/citizenscience). The apps were chosen according to crucial characteristics, i.e. offline usage, operative system independence, strong development and support community, customization of user interfaces.

The potential for Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) to be adopted for passive disease surveillance and mediated through an enhanced relationship between researchers and non-scientists is of special interest to the authors. In particular, mobile devices and wireless communication permit the public to be more involved in research to a greater degree. Furthermore, the accuracy of these devices is rapidly improving, allowing the authors to address questions of uncertainty and error in data collections. Cooperation between researchers and the public integrates themes common to VGI and PGIS (Participatory Geographic Information), to bring about a new paradigm in GIScience. This paper outlines the prototype for a VGI system that incorporates the traditional role of researchers in spatial data analysis and exploration and the willingness of the public, through traditional PGIS, to be engaged in data collection for the purpose of surveillance of tsetse flies, the primary vector of African Trypanosomiasis. This system allows for two-way communication between researchers and the public for data collection, analysis, and the ultimate dissemination of results.

The strong influence of ICT emerged in the 1980s when the availability of microcomputer systems and telecommunication facilities facilitated the development of global sensor networks. Since the 1990 s the growth of the Internet has driven standardisation processes for protocols, interfaces and data exchange, providing the foundations for today’s TWS. The ongoing development of global warning infrastructures depends on the capability to integrate national and local TWS into system-of-systems.

Uhl; Deborah Balk; Bryan Jones,"Global data on settlements, built-up land and population distributions are becoming increasingly available and represent important inputs to a better understanding of key demographic processes such as urbanization and interactions between human and natural systems over time. One persistent drawback that prevents user communities from effectively and objectively using these data products more broadly, is the absence of thorough and transparent validation studies. This study develops a validation framework for accuracy assessment of multi-temporal built-up land layers using integrated public parcel and building records as validation data. The framework is based on measures derived from confusion matrices and incorporates a sensitivity analysis for potential spatial offsets between validation and test data as well as tests for the effects of varying criteria of the abstract term built-up land on accuracy measures. Furthermore, the framework allows for accuracy assessments by strata of built-up density, which provides important insights on the relationship between classification accuracy and development intensity to better instruct and educate user communities on quality aspects that might be relevant to different purposes. We use data from the newly-released Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL), for four epochs since 1975 and at fine spatial resolution (38m), in the United States for a demonstration of the framework. The results show very encouraging accuracy measures that vary across study areas, generally improve over time but show very distinct patterns across the rural-urban trajectories. Areas of higher development intensity are very accurately classified and highly reliable. Rural areas show low degrees of accuracy, which could be affected by misalignment between the reference data and the data under test in areas where built-up land is scattered and rare. However, a regression analysis, which examines how well GHSL can estimate built-up land using spatially aggregated analytical units, indicates that classification error is mainly of thematic nature. Thus, caution should be taken in using the data product in rural regions. The results can be useful in further improving classification procedures to create measures of the built environment. The validation framework can be extended to data-poor regions of the world using map data and Volunteered Geographic Information.",204,,898,917,Data mining; Built environment; Regression analysis; Test data; Reference data (financial markets); Urbanization; Computer science; Volunteered geographic information; Remote sensing; Data integration; Thematic map,Accuracy assessment; Data integration; Global Human Settlement Layer; Open data; Spatiotemporal uncertainty; Urban land,10.1016/j.rse.2017.08.035,2763014865

Citizens’ resources in the form of knowledge, skills, as well as their collaboration with authorities have been identified in the governance literature as crucial elements in sustainable development. Technical advancement in internet communication technology (ICT) presents novel opportunities for engaging and leveraging civic knowledge and skills into different levels of governance. These options are still largely unexplored in governance research on urban green infrastructure (UGI). In this paper, we analyse three different digital tools (e-tools) from the perspective of a Scandinavian planning context. We explore how e-tools can support UGI governance and the perceived barriers. The e-tools explored are three digital platforms with a focus on public participation related to UGI. The three e-tools are map-based, i.e., users share information on digital maps: so-called Volunteered Geographic Information. Here, we call them place-based e-tools. We explore and analyse their adoption into UGI governance, the institutional contexts that affect them and also discuss potential of e-tools in place-based governance. Our findings indicate that the analysed tools all facilitate UGI governance in terms of engaging citizens in use, management, and planning of UGI. However, there are challenges to be aware of, such as the digital divide and the importance of clear participatory frameworks. We conclude that place-based e-tools have potential for UGI governance and that there is potential to strengthen links to ‘place’, while continuously testing and challenging new opportunities as technology rapidly develops.",40,,245,253,Business; Digital divide; Information sharing; Environmental governance; Public participation; Green infrastructure; Corporate governance; Public participation GIS; Knowledge management; Information and Communications Technology,,10.1016/j.ufug.2018.09.003,2892127469

Triglav-Čekada; D. Radovan,"<jats:p>Abstract. Volunteered geographical information represents a promising field in the monitoring and mapping of natural disasters. The contributors of volunteered geographical information have the advantage that they are at the location of the natural disaster at exactly the time when the disaster happened. Therefore, they can provide the most complete account of the extent of the damage. This is not always possible when applying photogrammetric or remote-sensing methods, as prior to the data acquisition an order to carry out the measurements has to be made. On 5 and 6 November 2012 almost half of Slovenia was badly affected by floods. The gathering of volunteered geographical information in the form of images and videos of these floods is presented. Two strategies were used: (1) a public call for volunteered contributions and (2) a web search for useful images and their authors. The authorship of these images was verified with every contributor. In total, 15 contributors provided 102 terrestrial and aerial images and one aerial video, with 45% classified as potentially useful. For actual flood mapping 22 images and 12 sequences from video were used. With the help of the volunteered images 12% of the most severely affected river sections were mapped. Altogether, 1195.3 ha of flooded areas outside of the usual river beds along a total river length of 48 km were mapped. The results are compared with those from satellite mapping of the same floods, which successfully covered 18% of the most affected river sections.;                     </jats:p>",13,11,2753,2762,Photogrammetry; Natural disaster; Satellite; Geography; Aerial video; Flood mapping; Cartography; Remote sensing,,10.5194/nhess-13-2753-2013,2055230908

Processing these VHR data with advanced interferometric techniques, such as SAR tomography (TomoSAR), allows for the generation of four-dimensional point clouds, containing not only the 3-D positions of the scatterer location but also the estimates of seasonal/temporal deformation on the scale of centimeters or even millimeters, making them very attractive for generating dynamic city models from space. Motivated by these chances, the authors have earlier proposed approaches that demonstrated first attempts toward reconstruction of building facades from this class of data. The approaches work well when high density of facade points exists, and the full shape of the building could be reconstructed if data are available from multiple views, e.g., from both ascending and descending orbits. However, there are cases when no or only few facade points are available. This usually happens for lower height buildings and renders the detection of facade points/regions very challenging. Moreover, problems related to the visibility of facades mainly facing toward the azimuth direction (i.e., facades orthogonally oriented to the flight direction) can also cause difficulties in deriving the complete structure of individual buildings. These problems motivated us to reconstruct full 2-D/3-D shapes of buildings via exploitation of roof points. In this paper, we present a novel and complete data-driven framework for the automatic (parametric) reconstruction of 2-D/3-D building shapes (or footprints) using unstructured TomoSAR point clouds particularly generated from one viewing angle only. The proposed approach is illustrated and validated by examples using TomoSAR point clouds generated using TerraSAR-X high-resolution spotlight data stacks acquired from ascending orbit covering two different test areas, with one containing simple moderate-sized buildings in Las Vegas, USA and the other containing relatively complex building structures in Berlin, Germany.",54,3,1292,1310,Parametric statistics; Visibility; Point cloud; Iterative reconstruction; Artificial intelligence; Viewing angle; Roof; Facade; Computer vision; Computer science; Remote sensing; Synthetic aperture radar,,10.1109/tgrs.2015.2477429,2288642056

However, existing studies on measuring cold stress are based on biometeorological indices designed for temperate regions. This may overestimate the impact of wind chill on mortality risk in subtropical cities. This study developed an Adjusted Wind Chill Equivalent Temperature (AWCET) index. A spatially-controlled time-stratified approach was applied to evaluate the ability of AWCET for estimating cold mortality in subtropical cities, based on a mortality dataset (2008–2012) in Hong Kong. The use of AWCET could indicate increase in all-cause, cardiovascular, respiratory, and cancer-related mortality risk during the days with average temperature < = 1st [11.0 °C], <= 3rd [12.6 °C] and < = 5th [13.4 °C] percentiles. The results were stable and consistent based on both log-linear and curve-linear relationships between AWCET and mortality risk. AWCET was also compared with the New Wind Chill Equivalent Temperature (NWCET) designed for temperate regions, and has found that higher magnitude of mortality risk would be found when using AWCET for assessing all-cause and cause-specific mortality in Hong Kong, for days with average temperature < = 1st, <= 3rd and < = 5th percentiles. AWCET is validated to be effective to access cold mortality in the context of subtropical cities.

De Sabbata; L. Dowthwaite,"This paper presents the results of an exploratory quantitative analysis of gendered contributions to the online mapping project OpenStreetMap (OSM), in which previous research has identified a strong male participation bias. On these grounds, theories of representation in volunteered geographic information (VGI) have argued that this kind of crowdsourced data fails to embody the geospatial interests of the wider community. The observed effects of the bias however, remain conspicuously absent from discourses of VGI and gender, which proceed with little sense of impact. This study addresses this void by analysing OSM contributions by gender and thus identifies differences in men’s and women’s mapping practices. An online survey uniquely captured the OSM IDs as well as the declared gender of 293 OSM users. Statistics relating to users’ editing and tagging behaviours openly accessible via the ‘how did you contribute to OSM’ wiki page were subsequently analysed. The results reveal that volumes of overall activity as well editing and tagging actions in OSM remain significantly dominated by men. They also indicate subtle but impactful differences in men’s and women’s preferences for modifying and creating data, as well as the tagging categories to which they contribute. Discourses of gender and ICT, gender relations in online VGI environments and competing motivational factors are implicated in these observations. As well as updating estimates of the gender participation bias in OSM, this paper aims to inform and stimulate subsequent discourses of gender and representation towards a new rationale for widening participation in VGI.",85,6,1,18,Sociology; Data science; Gender relations; Volunteered geographic information; Information and Communications Technology; Human geography; Participation bias; Geospatial analysis,,,2954988200

However, less attention has been paid to developing an efficient model for crowdsourcing EO products through geoportals. To this end, a new model called the “Open Community-Based Crowdsourcing Geoportal for Earth Observation Products” (OCCGEOP) was proposed in this study. The model was developed based on the concepts of volunteered geographic information (VGI) and community-based geoportals using the latest open technological solutions. The key contribution lies in the conceptualization of the frameworks for automated publishing of standard map services such as the Web Map Service (WMS) and the Web Coverage Service (WCS) from heterogeneous EO products prepared by volunteers as well as the communication portion to request voluntary publication of the map services and giving feedback for quality assessment and assurance. To evaluate the feasibility and performance of the proposed model, a prototype implementation was carried out by conducting a pilot study in Iran.

B. Palmer; Frederic Bartumeus,"This chapter describes AtrapaelTigre.com, a citizen science project focusing on the Asian tiger mosquito in Spain. Commonly known for its aggressive biting during the day, the tiger mosquito represents a global environmental problem. It is an invasive species and a vector for dengue, chikungunya and other diseases, making it a serious public health risk. It is also an everyday nuisance and a threat to tourism and related industries. The management of invasive species, and particularly disease vectors, requires integrated programs that combine public communication and education with research, surveillance and control. AtrapaelTigre.com aims at achieving this by engaging citizen scientists to raise awareness and collect data on tiger mosquito adults and their breeding sites with a smartphone app (Tigatrapp) and a multi-proxy data validation system that combines expert, crowd, and app-user input. Lessons learned during the first year of implementation in Spain, in 2014, have guided our current strategies with respect to both tiger mosquitoes and the formal integration of citizen science into the research, surveillance and control of invasive species and disease vectors generally. We address the challenges of implementing such frameworks and discuss their fitness for use in public health systems. The goal of AtrapaelTigre.com is not only to enhance participation and raise awareness, but also to promote novel research and a more informed and cost-effective management of the tiger mosquito across Spain.Peer reviewe",,,295,308,Ecology; Citizen science; Geography; Media studies; Volunteered geographic information; Spanish Civil War; Tiger,,10.5334/bax.v,2513233470

Nieuwenhuijsen,"The World Health Organization recognises the importance of natural environments for human health. Evidence for natural environment-health associations comes largely from single countries or regions, with varied approaches to measuring natural environment exposure. We present a standardised approach to measuring neighbourhood natural environment exposure in cities in different regions of Europe. The Positive Health Effects of the Natural Outdoor environment in TYPical populations of different regions in Europe (PHENOTYPE) study aimed to explore the mechanisms linking natural environment exposure and health in four European cities (Barcelona, Spain; Doetinchem, the Netherlands; Kaunas, Lithuania; and Stoke-on-Trent, UK). Common GIS protocols were used to develop a hierarchy of natural environment measures, from simple measures (e.g., NDVI, Urban Atlas) using Europe-wide data sources, to detailed measures derived from local data that were specific to mechanisms thought to underpin natural environment-health associations (physical activity, social interaction, stress reduction/restoration). Indicators were created around residential addresses for a range of straight line and network buffers (100 m–1 km). For simple indicators derived from Europe-wide data, we observed differences between cities, which varied with different indicators (e.g., Kaunas and Doetinchem had equal highest mean NDVI within 100 m buffer, but mean distance to nearest natural environment in Kaunas was more twice that in Doetinchem). Mean distance to nearest natural environment for all cities suggested that most participants lived close to some kind of natural environments (64 ± 58–363 ± 281 m; mean 180 ± 204 m). The detailed classification highlighted marked between-city differences in terms of prominent types of natural environment. Indicators specific to mechanisms derived from this classification also captured more variation than the simple indicators. Distance to nearest and count indicators showed clear differences between cities, and those specific to the mechanisms showed within-city differences for Barcelona and Doetinchem. This paper demonstrates the feasibility and challenges of creating comparable GIS-derived natural environment exposure indicators across diverse European cities. Mechanism-specific indicators showed within- and between-city variability that supports their utility for ecological studies, which could inform more specific policy recommendations than the traditional proxies for natural environment access.",16,1,16,16,Environmental resource management; Social relation; Public health; Level design; Normalized Difference Vegetation Index; Neighbourhood (mathematics); Health geography; Geography; Urban planning; Human geography,Health; Nature; Parks; Physical activity; Social interaction; Stress; Urban planning,10.1186/s12942-017-0090-z,2608136433

Active tweet clusters generated using Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) clustering algorithm and building footprint information are used to identify touristic places that ensure the availability of basic essential facilities for travelers. Furthermore, an investigation is made to examine the usefulness of nighttime light remotely sensed data to recognize such tourism areas. The study successfully discovered important tourism areas in urban and remote regions in Nepal which have relatively low social media penetration. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is examined using the F1 measure. The accuracy assessment showed F1 score of 0.72 and 0.74 in the selected regions.

This approach is built over a conceptual model that complies with the interoperable\ud; standards laid down by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) – e.g. Sensor Observation Service (SOS)\ud; and Web Feature Service (WFS) – and seeks to combine and present unified information in a web-based\ud; decision support tool.

Beside the data itself, data about community activity provides valuable insights into the mapping progress which can be useful for estimating data quality, understanding the activity of VGI communities or predicting future developments. This work proposes a conceptual as well as technical framework for structuring and analyzing mapping activity building on the concepts of activity theory. Taking OpenStreetMap as an example, the work outlines the necessary steps for converting database changes into user- and feature-centered operations and higher-level actions acting as a universal scheme for arbitrary spatio-temporal analyses of mapping activities. Different examples from continent to region and city-scale analyses demonstrate the practicability of the approach. Instead of focusing on the interpretation of specific analysis results, the work contributes on a meta-level by addressing several conceptual and technical questions with respect to the overall process of analyzing VGI community activity",5,3,37,,Database-centric architecture; Geography; Data quality; Data science; Structuring; Open data; Knowledge management; Volunteered geographic information,,10.3390/ijgi5030037,2298533687

In a little over a decade OSM has become the leading example of VGI on the Internet. OSM is not just a crowdsourced spatial database of VGI; rather, it has grown to become a vast ecosystem of data, software systems and applications, tools, and Web-based information stores such as wikis. An increasing number of developers, industry actors, researchers and other end users are making use of OSM in their applications. OSM has been shown to compare favourably with other sources of spatial data in terms of data quality. In addition to this, a very large OSM community updates data within OSM on a regular basis. This chapter provides an introduction to and review of OSM and the ecosystem which has grown to support the mission of creating a free, editable map of the whole world. The chapter is especially meant for readers who have no or little knowledge about the range, maturity and complexity of the tools, services, applications and organisations working with OSM data. We provide examples of tools and services to access, edit, visualise and make quality assessments of OSM data. We also provide a number of examples of applications, such as some of those used in navigation and routing, that use OSM data directly.

The agency needs data sets from elsewhere and workflows and protocols for creating its various products. Unsurprisingly, such workflows and inter-institutional arrangements have evolved into broader collaborations, particularly as &lt;i&gt;spatial data infrastructures (SDIs)&lt;/i&gt;. An SDI is an evolving concept about facilitating and coordinating the exchange and sharing of geospatial data and services between stakeholders from different levels in the geospatial data community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Commission on SDI &amp;amp; Standards (and its predecessors) of the International Cartographic Association (ICA) has developed formal models of an SDI, using the viewpoints of the &lt;i&gt;Reference Model for Open Distributed Processing (RM-ODP)&lt;/i&gt; and the &lt;i&gt;Unified Modeling Language (UML)&lt;/i&gt; for the detailed modelling. The Commission described an SDI from the &lt;i&gt;Enterprise Viewpoint&lt;/i&gt; (purpose, scope and policies for an SDI), &lt;i&gt;Information Viewpoint&lt;/i&gt; (semantics of information and information processing in an SDI) and &lt;i&gt;Computational Viewpoint&lt;/i&gt; (functional decomposition of the SDI into a set of services that interact through interfaces) (Hjelmager et al., 2008, Cooper et al., 2012). The ICA Commission did not investigate the &lt;i&gt;Engineering&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Technology Viewpoints&lt;/i&gt; of an SDI, because they are implementation-specific and the Commission has aimed at providing technology-independent models for an SDI. Other researchers have used the Engineering and Technology Viewpoints for specific SDIs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SDI stakeholders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Enterprise Viewpoint model (Hjelmager et al., 2008) included six types of &lt;i&gt;stakeholders&lt;/i&gt; in an SDI: &lt;i&gt;Policy Maker&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Producer&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Provider&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Broker&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Value-added Reseller&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;End User&lt;/i&gt;. Any one person, group, committee or organisation can have multiple stakeholder roles, which could be simultaneously. Each stakeholder can have an active or passive relationship with any activities or components in an SDI. A stakeholder in an SDI could also be considered to be an &lt;i&gt;actor&lt;/i&gt; (Oliveira and Lisboa-Filho, 2015). Various trends are increasing the number of stakeholders in the SDI, their associated diversity and heterogeneity, and the resources at their disposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, the ICA Commission assessed whether or not these SDI models catered for &lt;i&gt;volunteered geographical information (VGI)&lt;/i&gt;, that is, user-generated geospatial content, or user-generated content with geospatial components. The models are sufficiently robust to do so, though it was then realised that the SDI stakeholders needed to be described in more detail as &lt;i&gt;subtypes&lt;/i&gt; of the general roles of the six types of SDI stakeholders. The Commission then identified 24 subtypes for the stakeholders, with several of these subtypes having further sub-subtypes. For example, a &lt;i&gt;Producer&lt;/i&gt; could have a subtype &lt;i&gt;Status&lt;/i&gt;, which in turn could have the subtypes &lt;i&gt;Official Mapping Agency&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Commercial Mapping Agency&lt;/i&gt; (Cooper et al., 2011). However, a better term than subtype might be specialization, special case, attribute, activity or role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Collectively, these Enterprise, Information and Computational Viewpoints and the detailed stakeholders form what is known colloquially in the literature as the ICA &lt;i&gt;model&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;ICA’s formal model&lt;/i&gt; of an SDI, such as by (Oliveira et al., 2016). The ICA SDI model is not meant to be a &lt;i&gt;prescriptive&lt;/i&gt; model of an SDI, but rather a &lt;i&gt;descriptive&lt;/i&gt; one. The ICA SDI model is also implementation-independent and hence somewhat abstract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issues with the stakeholders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While all the stakeholder subtypes in an SDI were given definitions, some of the types and subtypes were confused with one another by other researchers. Further, it became clear that not all stakeholders have benevolent relationships with SDIs, whether the stakeholders be malevolent, or just too idle or incompetent to help the SDI succeed. Hence, it is necessary to update the ICA SDI stakeholder model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have reviewed the literature and several authors have proposed improvements to the ICA SDI stakeholder model and have highlighted parts of the model that are not well understood. Further, the ICA Commission itself has also revisited the model at previous meetings. The key contributions concerning the stakeholder model are summarised in this paper. They include:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Making it clear that any contributor to an SDI should control their assets in the SDI and can withdraw them when they see fit. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Catering explicitly for a contact or representative for any community. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Including an educator role, and by extension, a researcher role. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Including a role for those who fund the SDI itself and fund all of the relevant stakeholders so that they can function effectively. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Catering for how stakeholders could be assembled together, such as in special-interest groups. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Catering for oversight explicitly, such as through an ombud. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Making it clear that a subtype of a stakeholder is not necessarily subordinate to that stakeholder. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Characterising the maturity of a stakeholder. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Including a subtype for public-sector producers that are not official mapping agencies. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whether or not agency, contracting or representation roles or functions should be deemed to be separate stakeholders in the model. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improving the End User, which has only two subtypes. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Catering for shifts in the roles and characteristics of SDI stakeholders over time. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Including service producers explicitly. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Catering for representatives of the SDI who liaise with other organisations or other SDIs. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Including explicitly some of the roles within the Secretariat, such as systems administration, technical support and quality assurance. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some attributes could be common across all or most of the six types of stakeholders in an SDI, such as their motivation for contributing to, or using, any particular SDI; their authority or ability to contribute; whether or not they are liable for their contributions and any consequences thereof; and the ethics related to the contribution, including invasion of privacy, arbitrary restrictions or mischief. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The SDI stakeholder model needs to cater for both the top-down and the bottom-up approaches to an SDI.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;This paper proposes some revisions and expansions on this ICA model of the stakeholders in a spatial data infrastructure. While updating the model has not yet been completed, we believe that it will be appropriate to present our findings now to the ICA community to obtain feedback.&lt;/p&gt;;                     </jats:p>",1,,49,2,Business; Stakeholder theory; Workflow; Spatial data infrastructure; Stakeholder; Technical support; Knowledge management; Volunteered geographic information; End user; Geospatial analysis,,10.5194/ica-abs-1-49-2019,2957532900

The effects of the Shenzhen greenway network on supporting physical activities,,2016,journal article,Landscape and Urban Planning,01692046,Elsevier BV,Netherlands,Kun Liu; Kin Wai Michael Siu; Xi Yong Gong; Yuan Gao; Dan Lu,"In recent decades, greenways have been the focus of an international movement to improve urban environment quality. In metropolitan areas, more greenways are interconnected, forming a greenway network (GN). A GN is considered to encourage physical activities, but verifying this statement is difficult, as traditional social survey methods do not obtain fine-grain activity geographic data on a large scale. In view of this shortcoming, the volunteered geographic information and the geographic information system techniques were used to describe the distribution of physical activities in a GN, to explore the effects of greenway network features on supporting activities. The 1640-km-long Shenzhen GN was selected as a representative case, and walking, jogging and cycling were chosen as typical activities. The results showed that only a quarter of greenways were with activities. Greenways with dense residences, mixed land-use, advanced street network and large parks yielded positive effects on supporting physical activities, and advanced public transportation further improved activity diversity. Due to the spatial mismatch between the GN distribution and well-developed areas, the GN density showed negative effects on the presence of physical activities; within the greenways in use, the GN density significantly improved activity diversity, indicating the positive effect of network feature on supporting activities. Compared with neighbourhood greenways, city and regional greenways supported more physical activities due to richer natural resources. The findings reveal that GN in green and welldeveloped areas supports physical activities better. Location, green quality and network form are necessary for greenways and should be integrated into GN planning.School of Desig",152,,49,58,Built environment; Metropolitan area; Neighbourhood (mathematics); Geography; Street network; Geographic information system; Public transport; Volunteered geographic information; Spatial mismatch; Environmental planning,,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2016.04.001,2342451409

Stienmetz is a Lecturer in Tourism at the University of Surrey, UK where he is developing a program of research in destination management, the digital visitor economy, and big data analytics.  Jason was awarded a PhD in Business Administration from Temple University, USA in 2016.  His PhD dissertation “Foundations for a Network Model of Destination Value Creation” involved deconstructing visitor experiences using social media postings (over 4 million photos posted on Flickr) in order to model destinations’ value creation processes and identify characteristics of destination systems that maximize economic impact and improve destination competitiveness.  This research made contributions to both the academic literature and the practical management of destinations in a number of ways.  First and foremost, the study established that network principles hold true for tourism destinations and validates the “value network” paradigm of destination value creation.  This work also suggests that destination systems can be managed through an understanding of their network structures and that tourism destinations should not be considered as amalgams of independent touchpoints, but instead as dynamic systems where outcomes are dependent on the relationships between touchpoints.  The network model of destination value creation provides a framework upon which “smarter” destination systems will enable destination managers to gain competitive advantage.  Jason’s more recent research looks at the relationship between the structure of tourists’ sequence of activities within a destination trip and tourists’ expressed sentiment of those activities.  Using a moments-based paradigm grounded in the psychology, economics, geography, services management, and tourism literature, Jason continues to use big data methodologies to deconstruct visitor experiences based on social media postings and volunteered geographic information.  Results have indicated that some degree of structure exists in terms of how travelers organize their visits, and that trip characteristics and trip sequencing can influence value in terms of visitor satisfaction.  This research gains greater importance within tourism as new technologies have enabled the industry to capture moments-based experiences with the goal of designing and managing visitor experiences. Jason’s future research agenda includes continued development of the network model of destination value creation, and, in particular, the next step is to understand the antecedents of destination network structure formation and the ways in which optimal network structures can be managed to achieve competitive, sustainable, and resilient destinations.  Future research will also investigate how the sequence of tourist experiences may or may not impact destination value (in terms of visitor satisfaction and visitor expenditures), the influence of discrete experiences on the overall evaluation of a journey, and the degree to which travelers intentionally bundle various types of experiences before and during the trip.  Jason also collaborates with colleagues in the Digital Laboratory within University of Surrey’s School of Hospitality and Tourism Management, where he explores the role of new digital technologies (such as robotics, augmented reality, and virtual reality) in shaping the emotions and experiences of tourists. At the University of Surrey Jason teaches undergraduate modules in the Business Environment, Tourism Management, and Technology, Media & Data.  At the post-graduate level Jason teaches modules in Digital Marketing & Social Media and Tourism Social Science.  Jason also supervises masters and PhD students conducting research related to the digital visitor economy.  His other activities at the University of Surrey include organizing weekly School research seminars for the academic staff and PhD students, identifying and working with industry partners to develop research opportunities for post-graduate students, and serving on the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences Research Ethics Committee. Jason has conducted numerous research consultancy projects with tourism industry practitioners in the USA, UK, and Peru, and he has published in leading academic journals such as the Journal of Travel Research and Tourism Management.  Jason is an active member of the Travel and Tourism Research Association and the International Federation for IT and Travel & Tourism, and serves on the editorial boards of the Journal of Travel Research and the Journal of Information Technology and Tourism. Jason earned an undergraduate degree in Hotel, Restaurant & Tourism Management from the University of Wisconsin, where he graduated with honors.  Jason also has over 15 years of experience working in hospitality, including two years as a chef at a boutique country inn.  Jason is extremely proud to have served as a Community Economic Development Specialist with the United States Peace Corps in Costa Rica for two years after completing his undergraduate degree.  Living and working in a rural village, he was involved in a number of projects related to eco-tourism, technology education, and micro-finance.  His experiences volunteering with his wife in Costa Rica were fundamental in developing his interests in tourism systems and destination management and led to his pursuit of an advanced degree. After the Peace Corps, Jason earned a Master of Tourism Administration degree from the George Washington University Business School in Washington, D.C.  It was while working on his thesis “Usability Factors Influencing the Success of Mobile Optimized Destination Websites” that Jason realised that he had fallen forever in love with research.  While studying in Washington, D.C. Jason also had wonderful experiences as a research intern for both the International Institute for Tourism Studies and the U.S. Travel Association. After defending his PhD research proposal at Temple University, Jason moved to the University of Florida to work as a Research Coordinator for the National Laboratory for Tourism & eCommerce.  At the University of Florida Jason developed and designed numerous tourism and technology related research projects and he also taught Research Methods to both undergraduate and post-graduate tourism students as an Adjunct Lecturer.  Jason enjoys traveling with his wife and son, camping, drinking beer, and playing with Lego.",15,1,,,Hospitality; Psychology; Tourism; Hospitality management studies; Destinations; Public relations; Visitor pattern; Social media; Technology education; Digital marketing,,,2891210232

Hence, new opportunities arise for regional exploration that can lead to improvements in the lives of citizens through spatial decision support. We believe that the VGI data of the urban environment could be used to present a constructive overview of the regional infrastructure with the advent of web technologies. Current location-based services provide general map-based information for the end users with conventional local search functionality, and hence, the presentation of the rich urban information is limited. In this work, we analyze the OSM data to classify the geo entities into consequential categories with facilities, landscape and land use distribution. We employ a visual overlay of heat map and interactive visualizations to present the regional characterization on OSM data classification. In the proposed interface, users are allowed to express a variety of spatial queries to exemplify their geographic interests. They can compare the characterization of urban areas with respect to multiple spatial dimensions of interest and can search for the most suitable region.

This study proposes data-based guidelines to help design the data collection by assessing the reliability of volunteered data collected using the Geo-Wiki tool. We summarized the interpretation difficulties of the volunteers at a global scale, including those areas and land cover types that generate the most confusion. We also examined the factors affecting the reliability of majority opinion and individual classification. The results showed that the highest interpretation inconsistency of the volunteers occurred in the ecoregions of tropical and boreal forests (areas with relatively poor coverage of very high resolution images), the tundra (a unique region that the volunteers are unacquainted with), and savannas (transitional zones). The volunteers are good at identifying forests, snow/ice and croplands, but not grasslands and wetlands. The most confusing pairs of land cover types are also captured in this study and they vary greatly with different biomes. The reliability can be improved by providing more high resolution ancillary data, more interpretation keys in tutorials, and tools that assist in coverage estimation for those areas and land cover types that are most prone to confusion. We found that the reliability of the majority opinion was positively correlated with the percentage of volunteers selecting this choice and negatively related to their self-evaluated uncertainty when very high resolution images were available. Factors influencing the reliability of individual classifications were also compared and the results indicated that the interpretation difficulty of the target sample played a more important role than the knowledge base of the volunteers. The professional background and local knowledge had an influence on the interpretation performance, especially in identifying vegetation land cover types other than croplands.

A framework for cross-disciplinary research on community severance is developed, built on the results of two workshops attended by researchers from different disciplines. This framework takes into consideration the chain of direct and indirect effects of transport infrastructure and motorised traffic on local communities and the complexity in the methods used for analysing and formulating solutions to the problem. The framework is then compared with the views of practitioners, based on discussions held in a third and final workshop.

GIS and statistical methods are used to analyze social and geographical biases in health-related VGI through a case study of bed bug complaint data from New York City's 311 system. Reports of bed bug infestation from 311 are mapped and modeled to uncover associations with socioeconomic and built environment characteristics. Factors associated with bed bug report credibility are examined by comparing characteristics of confirmed reports with those for reports in which inspectors found no evidence of infestation (negative reports). A multilevel model of credibility incorporating report-, building-, and tract-level variables reveals strong geographical and socioeconomic biases, with negative reports generated more frequently from high-value residential buildings located in high-income neighborhoods with predominately white, non-Hispanic populations. Using 311 data for all bed bug reports, rather than confirmed reports, obscures the burden of these pests in high poverty neighborhoods and diminishes socioeconomic disparities.

This paper, based on the data from China’s OpenStreetMap road network in May 2014, taking 340 prefecture-level cities in China as its study area, presents the geometric-related (road density) and attribute-related (type diversity) spatial patterns of the OpenStreetMap road network, and explores their relationship. The results are as follows. (1) The distribution of OpenStreetMap road density in Shenzhen, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Macao predominantly obeys a “positive skewness distribution”. OpenStreetMap data for eastern China shows a higher overall and circular structure. In central China, there are noticeable discrepancies in the road density, whereas in western China, the road density is low. (2) The OpenStreetMap road diversity shows a normal distribution.

Previous work is mostly concentrated on the classification and analysis of tweets utilizing crowdsourcing or machine learning techniques. However, managing the high volume and velocity of social media messages still remains challenging. In order to enhance information extraction from social media, this chapter presents a new approach that relies upon the geographical relations between twitter data and flood phenomena. Our approach uses specific geographical features like hydrological data and digital elevation models to prioritize crisis-relevant twitter messages. We apply this approach to examine the River Elbe Flood in Germany in June 2013. The results show that our approach based on geographical relations can enhance information extraction from volunteered geographic information, thus being valuable for both crisis response and preventive flood monitoring.",,,55,71,Situation awareness; Information extraction; Geography; Crisis response; Social media; Knowledge management; Volunteered geographic information; Crowdsourcing; Emergency management; Flood myth,,10.1007/978-3-319-03611-3_4,202027534

With the availability of high spatial resolution remote sensing imagery, such as Sentinel-2, it is feasible to produce fine-scale impervious surface maps. For mapping high-resolution impervious surfaces, object-based image analysis (OBIA) classification method demonstrated its efficiency and accuracy by combining spectral information and spatial information. Although with some success, impervious surface estimation remains challenging because different land cover types share similar spectral information. With the emergence of affordable GPS-enabled devices (such as a smartphone) and web 2.0 development, more and more people are getting involved in sharing their locations with others or posting on the Internet. These volunteered geographical information (VGI) data provide a brand-new prospect for mapping urban impervious surfaces. This research proposes an optimized method for impervious surface mapping based on Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery and open street map (OSM) points-of-interest (POI) data. The proposed method was tested in Milwaukee county, US, and the results show that the overall accuracy of the proposed OBIA increases from 82.57% to 87.02% compared with the conventional OBIA.

Considering the OpenStreetMap Wiki website as a case study, this article investigates the nature of this negotiation, driven by a small group of mappers in a context of high contribution inequality. Despite the apparent consensus on the conceptualisation, the negotiation keeps unfolding in a tension between alternative representations, which are often incommensurable, i.e., hard to integrate and reconcile.

Volunteers collect and improve structures data by adding new features, removing obsolete points, and correcting existing data using a web-based mapping interface. Newly collected and modified point features become part of the USGS National Structures Dataset (NSD), a part of The National Map, which supplies data to US Topo maps, USGS cached base maps, and other derived products and services.

From an urban planning and economics perspective, this represents a spatial task: if more land is allocated to various types of green, how do the economic effects propagate throughout urban space? This paper focuses on the spatial marginal effects of forests, parks, and fields and estimates spatial hedonic models on a sample of apartment transactions in Helsinki, Finland. The results indicate that the capitalization of urban green in apartment prices depends on the type of green, but also interacts with distance to the city centre. Additionally, the effects contain variable pure and spatial spillover impacts, also conditional on type and location, the separation of which highlights aspects not commonly accounted for. The planning of green infrastructure will therefore benefit from parameterizing interventions according to location, green type, and character of spatial impacts",132,,279,289,Economy; Socioeconomic status; Regional science; Economics; Capitalization; City centre; Apartment; Green infrastructure; Urban space; Spatial spillover; Urban planning,,10.1016/j.ecolecon.2016.09.029,2554086314

Traditional methods of data collection are expensive, time consuming, and lack spatial and temporal detail. New sources have emerged as a result of crowdsourced data from fitness apps, allowing cyclists to track routes using GPS enabled cell phones. Our goal is to determine if crowdsourced data from fitness apps data can be used to quantify and map the spatial and temporal variation of ridership. Using data provided by Strava.com, we quantify how well crowdsourced fitness app data represent ridership through comparison with manual cycling counts in Victoria, British Columbia. Comparisons are made for hourly, AM and PM peak, and peak period totals that are separated by season. Using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and a Generalized Linear Model we modelled the relationships between crowdsourced data from Strava and manual counts and predicted categories of ridership into low, medium, and high for all roadways in Victoria. Our results indicate a linear association (r2 0.40 to 0.58) between crowdsourced data volumes and manual counts, with one crowdsourced data cyclist representing 51 riders. Categorical cycling volumes were predicted and mapped using data on slope, traffic speeds, on street parking, time of year, and crowdsourced ridership with a predictive accuracy of 62%. Crowdsourced fitness data are a biased sample of ridership, however, in urban areas the high temporal and spatial resolution of data can predict categories of ridership and map spatial variation.

This includes assessing park use, including for different recreational activities such as walking and running: but which platforms are best to use and why? To start to address these questions we compared geographic route data for park visitors from three large web share platforms: GPSies, MapMyFitness and Wikiloc. We obtained route data from all three platforms for an urban park (Daisy Hill), a peri-urban park (Lamington) and a more remote park (Mount Barney) in Australia. The largest number of user posted routes for the three parks was from MapMyFitness (1041 routes), including information on how walkers (572) and runners (469) use trails, particularly in Daisy Hill (705). However, the popularity of this platform is declining. In contrast, Wikiloc provided information on off track use, particularly in the more remote Mount Barney National Park. There were few trails on GPSies from the three parks, despite the platform’s popularity in Europe. The results indicate that the best platform to use will depend on the questions asked and the popularity of the platform with local users. Volunteered geographic data can be a cost and time efficient way to collect visitor data compared to some other methods, such as trail counters and observations, but it only reflects particular users, and is geographically and temporally variable as the popularity of platforms change among users.”; ; The authors would like to apologize for any inconvenience that this may have caused to the readers.; ; DOI of the original article: 10.1016/j.apgeog.2017.11.001",91,,168,168,Recreation; World Wide Web; Geography; Mount; Popularity; National park; Time efficient; Visitor pattern; Volunteered geographic information; Human geography,,10.1016/j.apgeog.2018.01.014,2790961064

Flood simulations are applications of disaster control, which are used for  the development of appropriate flood protection. Adequate simulations require not only  the geometry but also the roughness of the Earth’s surface, as well as the roughness of  the objects hereon. Usually, the floodplain roughness is based on land use/land cover maps derived from orthophotos. This study analyses the applicability of roughness map derivation approaches for flood simulations based on different datasets: orthophotos, LiDAR data, official land use data, OpenStreetMap data and CORINE Land Cover data. Object-based image analysis is applied to orthophotos and LiDAR raster data in order to generate land cover maps, which enable a roughness parameterization. The vertical vegetation structure within the LiDAR point cloud is used to derive an additional floodplain roughness map. Further roughness maps are derived from official land use data, OpenStreetMap and CORINE Land Cover datasets. Six different flood simulations are applied based on one elevation data but with the different roughness maps. The results of the hydrodynamic–numerical models include information on flow velocity and water depth from which the additional attribute flood intensity is calculated of.

The process is mostly automated, it was developed to be applied in a time- and resource-constrained environment and keeps the human factor in the loop in order to control the final decisions. We show that through this process the cognitive load (CL) for an expert image analyst will be reduced by 70%, while the process will successfully identify 85.6% of the potential landing sites. We conclude that the suggested methodology can be used as part of a disaster response process.</jats:p>",12,3,544,,Deep learning; Artificial intelligence; Process management; Disaster response; Computer science,,10.3390/rs12030544,3004700277

The use of data from collaborative mapping platforms appears as an alternative that may contribute to minimizing this problem, either by updating or completing the mapping coverage in Brazil, as proposed or performed by some National Mapping Agencies abroad. The present work aims to analyze a methodology to provide accurate and documented integration of volunteered geographic information and the Brazilian authoritative mapping. The proposal starts with the semantic compatibility between the conceptual models adopted in both official cartography and OpenStreetMap platform. The research continues with the identification of object classes with the most significant potential for integration. Finally, we developed some experiments to evaluate and validate the OSM data integration process in a 1:25,000 scale cartographic database. Even in regions with a recent mapping, the results of the preliminary assessment indicate the potential for an increase of about 52% and 16% of features in the ‘road system’ category, which suggests a very promising method for use in areas with missing or outdated mapping, and its applicability to other categories.</jats:p>",27,1,,,Data science; Computer science; Collaborative mapping; Data integration,,10.1590/s1982-21702021000100003,3127472223

H. van Vliet,"The increasing availability of volunteered geographic information (VGI) enables novel studies in many scientific domains. However, inconsistent VGI can negatively affect these studies. This paper describes a workflow that checks the consistency of Volunteered Phenological Observations (VPOs) while considering the synchrony of observations (i.e., the temporal dispersion of a phenological event). The geographic coordinates, day of the year (DOY) of the observed event, and the accumulation of daily temperature until that DOY were used to: (1) spatially group VPOs by connecting observations that are near to each other, (2) define consistency constraints, (3) check the consistency of VPOs by evaluating the defined constraints, and (4) optimize the constraints by analysing the effect of inconsistent VPOs on the synchrony models derived from the observations. This workflow was tested using VPOs collected in the Netherlands during the period 2003–2015. We found that the average percentage of inconsistent observations was low to moderate (ranging from 1% for wood anemone and pedunculate oak to 15% for cow parsley species). This indicates that volunteers provide reliable phenological information. We also found a significant correlation between the standard deviation of DOY of the observed events and the accumulation of daily temperature (with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.78 for lesser celandine, and 0.60 for pedunculate oak). This confirmed that colder days in late winter and early spring lead to synchronous flowering and leafing onsets. Our results highlighted the potential of synchrony information and geographical context for checking the consistency of phenological VGI. Other domains using VGI can adapt this geocomputational workflow to check the consistency of their data, and hence the robustness of their analyses.",7,12,487,,Statistics; Correlation; Standard deviation; Data quality; Synchronous flowering; Late winter; Mathematics; Phenology; Volunteered geographic information,,10.3390/ijgi7120487,2904715114

Trying to stimulate this growing demand, both researchers and Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) communities envision to extend established communities towards indoors. It has already been showcased that VGI from OpenStreetMap (OSM) can be utilized for different applications in Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDIs) as well as for simple shortest path computations inside buildings. The here presented research now tries to utilize crowdsourced indoor geodata for more complex indoor routing scenarios of multiple users. Essentially, it will be investigated if, and to what extent, the available data can be utilized for performing indoor evacuation simulations with the simulation framework MATSim. That is, this paper investigates the suitability of crowdsourced indoor information from OSM (IndoorOSM) for evacuation simulations. Additionally, the applicability of MATSim for agent-based indoor evacuation simulations is conducted.

A suitability model denotes how suitable geographic locations are for a specific purpose on which decision-makers need to make a decision. Particularly in the presence of volunteered information, data quality assessment becomes an important aspect of a decision-making process. Geographic data are commonly prone to incompleteness, imprecision and uncertainty, and this is even more the case with volunteered data. To correctly inform the users, it is essential to communicate not only the suitability degrees highlighted in a suitability model, but also the confidence about these suitability degrees as can be derived from data quality assessment. In this chapter, a novel hierarchical approach for data quality assessment, supporting the computation of associated confidence degrees, is introduced. To illustrate its added value, aspects of the project Transnational and Integrated Long-term marine Exploitation Strategies (TILES) are used.

This paper describes a simple comparison of the distributions of land cover features identified from volunteered data contributed by different social groups – in this case comparing two groups of Geo-Wiki campaigns. Understanding the impacts on analyses of citizen science data contributed by different groups is critical to ensure robust scientific outputs and to fully realise the potential benefits to formal scientific research. It is well known that different people, with different backgrounds and subject to different cultural factors, hold varying landscape conceptualisations. This paper analyses volunteered geographical information on land cover to generate land cover maps. It uses a geographically weighted approach to generate land cover mappings. The mappings generated by different groups (in this case a from a specific unnamed country) are compared and the results show how the predicted land cover distributions vary, with large differences in some classes (e.g. Barren land, Shrubland, Wetland) and little difference in others (e.g. Tree cover). This suggests that for some landscape features cultural and national differences matter when it comes to using crowdsourced data in formal scientific analyses and highlights the potential problems of not considering contributor backgrounds in citizen science. This is important because such data re now routinely being used to develop global land cover data, to generate uncertainty estimates of existing global land cover products and to generate global forest inventories. These in turn are being suggested as suitable inputs to such things as global climate models.

This research is motivated by the fact that although VGI is now widely consumed, contribution rates are lagging considerably. Compared to traditional GIS interfaces, with complex interfaces resulting in high cognitive loads and barriers to participation, VGI tools and interfaces need to be easy to use and learn to encourage and facilitate contributions. This article develops a case study of OpenStreetMap, one of the most successful VGI projects, and its default editor, Potlatch2. Ten participants with no prior experience of VGI contribution, were instructed to contribute data to OSM in a structured exercise, while being monitored using an eye tracker and audio/video screen capture software. Each participant was asked to Think Aloud, i.e. describe what they were thinking and doing as they completed the tasks. The results highlight significant usability issues impacting learnability, especially from the perspective of a new contributor: hidden functionality, lack of user feedback between interactions and the inefficient and inconsistent placement of functionality and map controls.

Tanyu; Guido Cervone; Nigel Waters,"Evaluating the condition of transportation infrastructure is an expensive, labor intensive, and time consuming process. Many traditional road evaluation methods utilize measurements taken in situ along with visual examinations and interpretations. The measurement of damage and deterioration is often qualitative and limited to point observations. Remote sensing techniques offer nondestructive methods for road condition assessment with large spatial coverage. These tools provide an opportunity for frequent, comprehensive, and quantitative surveys of transportation infrastructure. The goal of this paper is to provide a bridge between traditional procedures for road evaluation and remote sensing methodologies by creating a comprehensive reference for geotechnical engineers and remote sensing experts alike. A comprehensive literature review and survey of current techniques and research methods is provided to facilitate this bridge. A special emphasis is given to the challenges associated with transportation assessment in the aftermath of major disasters. The use of remote sensing techniques offers new potential for pavement managers to assess large areas, often in little time. Although remote sensing techniques can never entirely replace traditional geotechnical methods, they do provide an opportunity to reduce the number or size of areas requiring site visits or manual methods.",7,2,1,19,Engineering; Transport engineering; Pavement management; Road condition; Transportation infrastructure; Pavement maintenance; Evaluation methods; Remote sensing,,10.1007/s12544-015-0156-6,2133251833

It entails manifold practices and discourses which are currently investigated from both affirmative and critical perspectives. Expanding on the range of theoretical approaches to VGI, this article explores the condition and the limits of VGI from a social theory perspective to explore the following questions: what is the basic structure of VGI both as a form of practice and a form of knowledge? What are aspects of integration and aspects of divergence with regard to VGI practices? Are there inherent limitations to VGI practices especially with regard to its emancipatory and educational potential? To approach these issues several established analytical frameworks are discussed, and a specific categorization of VGI’s symbolic geographies as interaction content will be introduced. Based on this categorization two opposed types of interaction practice can be distinguished: While information on VGI gathering and processing as a part of interaction content is vital to a competent use and deeper understanding of the system (“self-explanatory”) many interface designs have a very limited output in order to promote user-friendliness (“easy-to-use”). While the latter may increase the popularity of VGI it also limits interaction language to everyday language, to familiar spatial vocabularies of place, city, region, landscape or nation—instead of mediating technology’s spatialities or exploring more innovative ways of spatial representation.",83,4,871,884,Sociology; Philosophy of technology; Popularity; Spatial representation; Social theory; Geographic information system; Knowledge management; Volunteered geographic information; Human geography; Categorization,,10.1007/s10708-017-9794-7,2742490600

While researchers have yet to settle on a single definition of the Geoweb, Crampton (2009) provides several common denominators of this ""explosion of new spatial media on the web"": cartography, citizen-orientation, and strong ties to the notion of public production of knowledge in participatory contexts (""crowdsourcing,"" p. 91). The term participatory Geoweb was coined by Sieber (2008) to describe ""the involvement of advocacy nonprofits and marginalized communities ... in the geospatial technologies of Web 2.0"" (p. 59). Geoweb tools can function as powerful conduits for gathering volunteered geographic information (VGI) for collaborative planning, deliberation, and argumentation (Flaxman 2010, Goodchild 2010). Each Geoweb application has its own objectives, target users, types of contributions, spatial contexts, and other attributes, resulting in substantial difficulties when trying to establish metrics for success and effectiveness. To address this challenge, this article builds on established findings in the geographic information science literature to propose a novel framework, which is designed to evaluate participatory initiatives that utilize Geoweb technologies, and may be extensible to public participation geographic information systems (PPGIS) and other participatory media. It also provides a structured approach for contextualizing the processes inherent in user participation through these media. The following section provides the research context, background on participation, and spatial decision making, and introduces concepts used in the proposed framework. This lays the groundwork for the subsequently presented description of the ""3E Framework"" with its provider and public realms, interaction space, and engagement, empowerment, and enactment processes. To conclude, we describe how this framework may be deployed, outline some of its limitations, and make a call for continued efforts to unite participatory Geoweb theories with practice. RESEARCH CONTEXT Origins of the Geoweb Recent years have seen the emergence of Web 2.0 as the next generation of online networking, where users contribute content by uploading files, writing reviews, rating contents, and otherwise contributing to a ""collective intelligence"" (Levy 1997, Gordon-Murname 2006). While O'Reilly (2005) is credited with coining the term Web 2.0, it first appears six years earlier in an article by DiNucci (1999). Controversy aside, the fact remains that the Web is shifting from a static information source to an interactive platform integrating user contributions, and efforts to leverage these capabilities to empower citizens in spatial decision-making processes abound (e.g., Ward, Gibson et al. 2003; Miller 2006; Tulloch 2007; Mericskay and Roche 2010). As the Web continues to evolve from a one-way information conduit to a multidirectional interactive space, so, too, does it adopt new spatial contexts. The concepts underpinning the Geoweb can be traced back to Herring (1994), whose U.S. Department of Defense paper postulated the implementation of ""spatial indexing geometry"" for battlefield mapping and simulation. He called this the beginning of the ""spatialization of the internet"" (p. 1). During the following decade, interactive mapping applications exploded across the Web, backed by information technology giants Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo (Goodchild 2005 Craglia, Goodchild et al. 2008). It did not take long for users worldwide to recognize the value of interactive ""cybercartography""; Peterson's (2005) study concluded that maps were, at the time, the second most frequent request over the Internet (next to weather forecasts) (Taylor and Claquard 2006). The synthesis of Web 2.0 concepts with online mapping technologies produces the participatory Geoweb, a ""phenomenon that has taken the world of geographic information by storm"" (Goodchild 2007, Maguire 2007, Tulloch 2007). …",25,2,15,,The Internet; World Wide Web; Geoweb; Participatory media; Computer science; Public participation GIS; Knowledge management; Volunteered geographic information; Crowdsourcing; Collective intelligence; Geospatial analysis,,,798541157

However, applications involving user-generated geospatial content show dramatically diversified patterns in terms of incentive, type and level of participation, purpose of the activity, data/metadata provided and data quality. This study contributes to this heterogeneous context by investigating public participation in GIS within the field of mobile-based applications. Results not only show examples of how to technically build GIS applications enabling user collection and interaction with geospatial data, but they also draw conclusions about the methods and needs of public participation. We describe three projects with different scales and purposes in the context of urban monitoring and planning, and tourism valorisation. In each case, an open source architecture is used, allowing users to exploit their mobile devices to collect georeferenced information.

First, it focuses on those characteristics of VGI projects that present different goals and modes of organization, while using a crowdsourcing strategy to manage participants and contributions. Next, a tool is developed in order to design the central crowdsourced processing unit that is best suited for a specific project definition, associating it with a trend towards crowd-based or community-driven approaches. The design is structured around the characterization of different ways of participating, and the task cognitive demand of working on geo-information management, spatial problem solving and ideation, or knowledge acquisition. Then, the crowdsourcing process design helps to identify what kind of participants are needed and outline subsequent engagement strategies. This is based on an analysis of differences among volunteers? participatory behaviors and the associated set of factors motivating them to contribute, whether on a crowd or community-sourced basis. From a VGI system perspective, this paper presents a set of guidelines and methodological steps in order to align project goals, processes and volunteers and thus successfully attract participation.

Rosemartin; Katharine L. Gerst; Jake F. Weltzin,"Recent improvements in online information communication and mobile location-aware technologies have led to the production of large volumes of volunteered geographic information. Widespread, large-scale efforts by volunteers to collect data can inform and drive scientific advances in diverse fields, including ecology and climatology. Traditional workflows to check the quality of such volunteered information can be costly and time consuming as they heavily rely on human interventions. However, identifying factors that can influence data quality, such as inconsistency, is crucial when these data are used in modeling and decision-making frameworks. Recently developed workflows use simple statistical approaches that assume that the majority of the information is consistent. However, this assumption is not generalizable, and ignores underlying geographic and environmental contextual variability that may explain apparent inconsistencies. Here we describe an automated workflow to check inconsistency based on the availability of contextual environmental information for sampling locations. The workflow consists of three steps: (1) dimensionality reduction to facilitate further analysis and interpretation of results, (2) model-based clustering to group observations according to their contextual conditions, and (3) identification of inconsistent observations within each cluster. The workflow was applied to volunteered observations of flowering in common and cloned lilac plants (Syringa vulgaris and Syringa x chinensis) in the United States for the period 1980 to 2013. About 97% of the observations for both common and cloned lilacs were flagged as consistent, indicating that volunteers provided reliable information for this case study. Relative to the original dataset, the exclusion of inconsistent observations changed the apparent rate of change in lilac bloom dates by two days per decade, indicating the importance of inconsistency checking as a key step in data quality assessment for volunteered geographic information. Initiatives that leverage volunteered geographic information can adapt this workflow to improve the quality of their datasets and the robustness of their scientific analyses.",10,10,140811,,Geoinformatics; Data visualization; Workflow; Data quality; Data science; Volunteered geographic information; Bioinformatics; Dimensionality reduction; Cluster analysis; Biology; Sampling (statistics),,10.1371/journal.pone.0140811,1846707281

The research has been carried on during the academic year 2014/2015, involving students from the course of Geography of Networks within the post graduate degrees in ‘Economics’ and ‘Business’ of the University of Trieste (Italy). The intent was testing the potential of crowdsourcing in retrieving data using a bottom up approach, relying on a set of trained and aware ‘urban sensors’ as data collectors. This allowed us to derive first-hand geographical data concerning a particular topic and analyze its spatial distribution by means of Geographical Information Systems and spatial analytical tools. The topic studied was represented by the urban ‘movida’, the analysis of the areas of the city that are more or less active during the days and during the week. This major aim was also coupled with an ancillary one, as the coverage of Wi-Fi hotspots and networks over the urban area of Trieste. It is known that many Italian cities still do not allow a very wide coverage of wireless networks to access the Internet. The city of Trieste, on the border between Italy and Slovenia, is suited with a certain degree of coverage, particularly in main roads and squares, thanks to free Wi-Fi coverage managed by the municipality and an academic network of Eduroam system, quite spread over European and world cities hosting universities and research centers",,,391,411,Wireless network; The Internet; Information system; Geography; Data science; Mobile mapping; Urban area; Academic year; Volunteered geographic information; Cartography; Crowdsourcing,,10.1007/978-3-319-19602-2_24,2521814495

Emerging techniques like volunteered geographic information (VGI) collection are making label placement more complexed with many features in a limited space, especially for points of interest (POI). In order to improve the quality and the efficiency of point feature labelling, there have been massive researches focusing on issues like position models, assessment criteria and optimization methods. Most of the researches were using vector-based methods while raster-based methods were less used, because vector-based methods have the advantage of easy definition of features and labels but are usually followed by computation complexity problems for features with high density. In contrast raster-based methods are faster and more flexible, though being harder to represent features and labels precisely on the map grids. Considering that hexagon partitioning was rarely used in raster-based methods, compared with the most commonly used square portioning, and hexagon was potentially useful for its oblique sides and isotropic orientations, hexagonal grids were used in this research to investigate better point feature labelling approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new raster-based method was promoted to figure out high quality label placement of POI in dense area. Labels were placed on a hexagonal map grids based on the principles that one Chinese character is set to one hexagon unit with the mathematical relationship of &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;&amp;amp;thinsp;=&amp;amp;thinsp;((&amp;amp;radic;3+1)/2)&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;, while &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt; is the side length of a hexagon unit and &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; is the size of a Chinese character. Considering that hexagon grids are divided into flat topped type and pointy topped type, which leads to different orientations, split hexagons were promoted to extend orientations from 6 to 8 based on pointy topped grids. A hexagon is partitioned into two parts labelled ‘left’ and ‘right’ and a split hexagon is the combination of a ‘left’ part and a ‘right’ part separately from two neighboring hexagons, as shown in figure 1. Then every hexagon on the grid will have four status: not-occupied {(0,0)}, half-occupied {(0,1) and (1,0)} and both-occupied {(1,1)}. Based on the fundamental concepts above, specific definitions were made on how labels were supposed to be represented on hexagonal map grids, including the length, orientation, writing direction, character orientation and position of the labels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approach first initially arranges labels of POI with different combinations of label orientations while pursuing coherence as much as possible, including procedures of rasterization of vector data, POI grouping and initial scheme computation. Every POI in a same group would have same label orientation and every POI group may have several accessible orientations thus making initial schemes diverse. Then a second positioning algorithm was conducted to handle overlapping (labels with POI, labels with labels) problems and improve the overall quality of labelling. The algorithm used the methods of position changing and label turning, which allow label to change its position around POI and sometimes change the orientation when it is necessary to avoid collisions. Quality of labels in a closed block was assessed from three aspects: preferential orientation, occlusion and spaciousness. POI data was chosen from restaurant, hotel and shop facilities and figure 2 showed one of the examples of label placement results using this method. The results have shown good orientation consistency of labels and occlusions were reduced to the lowest, though several label-label occlusions remained due to the limited space. After being compared with vector-based method, the approach has shown better performance on maintaining map legibility, aesthetics and harmony.&lt;/p&gt;;                     </jats:p>",1,,1,2,Point of interest; Artificial intelligence; Oblique case; Pattern recognition; Raster graphics; Grid; Legibility; Character orientation; Computer science; Computation; Volunteered geographic information,,10.5194/ica-abs-1-4-2019,2957141776

Broday; Alena Bartonova,"In recent years there has been a trend to view the Citizens’ Observatory as an increasingly essential tool that provides an approach for better observing, understanding, protecting and enhancing our environment. However, there is no consensus on how to develop such a system, nor is there any agreement on what a Citizens’ Observatory is and what results it could produce. The increase in the prevalence of Citizens’ Observatories globally has been mirrored by an increase in the number of variables that are monitored, the number of monitoring locations and the types of participating citizens. This calls for a more integrated approach to handle the emerging complexities involved in this field, but before this can be achieved, it is essential to establish a common foundation for Citizens’ Observatories and their usage. There are many aspects to a Citizens’ Observatory. One view is that its essence is a process that involves environmental monitoring, information gathering, data management and analysis, assessment and reporting systems. Hence, it requires the development of novel monitoring technologies and of advanced data management strategies to capture, analyse and survey the data, thus facilitating their exploitation for policy and society. Practically, there are many challenges in implementing the Citizens’ Observatory approach, such as ensuring effective citizens’ participation, dealing with data privacy, accounting for ethical and security requirements, and taking into account data standards, quality and reliability. These concerns all need to be addressed in a concerted way to provide a stable, reliable and scalable Citizens’ Observatory programme. On the other hand, the Citizens’ Observatory approach carries the promise of increasing the public’s awareness to risks in their environment, which has a corollary economic value, and enhancing data acquisition at low or no cost. In this paper, we first propose a conceptual framework for a Citizens’ Observatory programme as a system that supports and promotes community-based environmental governance. Next, we discuss some of the challenges involved in developing this approach. This work seeks to initiate a debate and help defining what is the Citizens’ Observatory, its potential role in environmental governance, and its validity as a tool for environmental research.",13,1,107,107,Information privacy; Conceptual framework; Data management; Citizen science; Environmental governance; Public participation; Observatory; Environmental monitoring; Knowledge management; Medicine; Environmental health,,10.1186/1476-069x-13-107,2128335979

Among the issues that emerged were individual privacy, epistemology, infrastructural changes wrought by localized data collection, and Big Science. Ten years later I interviewed Professor Goodchild again. Since then,Web 2.0 and the ubiquity of data and mapping have radically altered the intellectual landscape of GIS. In this new interview we discuss the possible eclipse of GIS by free, web-based technologies that include Google Earth, mash-ups, and data scraping. Not surprisingly, issues such as individual privacy and critical GIS remain relevant, but they are joined by a host of previously unimaginable phenomena that bear scrutiny by geographers. Web 2.0 is the host for the emerging technologies that have so altered our environment in GIScience. Web 2.0 broadly refers to a new generation of Internet services and technology. `The participatory web' as opposed to the `web as static information source' is frequently attached to descriptions of Web 2.0; user-created content and collaboration are its hallmarks. The concept that the average Internet user can create content is considered an essential element of Web 2.0 (Hendler and Golbeck, 2008). Web 2.0 promises to democratize the Internet to a degree not seen (Barsky and Purdon, 2006). Recognizable applications include wikis, blogs, mashups, and, more recently volunteered geographic information and citizen sensors (see also Elwood, 2008). Overall, the target of Web 2.0 is a richer more complete Web experience available to all Internet users. The implications for geographers are, however, extensive. Neogeography is one term that has emerged to describe a set of Web 2.0 techniques and tools that fall outside the realm of traditional, proprietary GIS such as ArcGIS (Turner, 2006). Neogeography is bringing traditional cartographic and GIS skills to the masses. It is democratizing a once exclusive domain (Boulos et al, 2006), but in the process removes authority and certainty (unwarranted in some cases) associated with GIS maps. GIS and geography have to adjust to this dynamic technical and social landscape. Mapping has evolved rapidly from paper, to GIS, to web-based mapping. Each transformation is associated with profound social impacts. We face scenarios, previously unimaginable, of human beings as sensors gathering constant information with their cell phones and reporting back information to central, web-based data-collating sites. These data could be as innocuous as snow quality on ski hills or animal deaths on the highway with GPS locations. Or they could include The new Brave NewWorld: geography, GIS, and the emergence of ubiquitous mapping and data",27,4,571,572,The Internet; World Wide Web; Data scraping; Mashup; Citizen journalism; Emerging technologies; Neogeography; Volunteered geographic information; Human geography,,10.1068/d3809,2013698563

Effectively mitigating air pollution in urban areas necessitates accurate air quality exposure information. Recent advancements in sensor technology and the increasing popularity of volunteered geographic information (VGI) open up new possibilities for air quality exposure assessment in cities. However, citizens and their sensors are put in areas deemed to be subjectively of interest (e.g., where citizens live, school of their kids or working spaces), and this leads to missed opportunities when it comes to optimal air quality exposure assessment. In addition, while the current literature on VGI has extensively discussed data quality and citizen engagement issues, few works, if any, offer techniques to fine-tune VGI contributions for an optimal air quality exposure assessment. This article presents and tests an approach to minimise land use regression prediction errors on citizen-contributed data. The approach was evaluated using a dataset (N = 116 sensors) from the city of Stuttgart, Germany. The comparison between the existing network design and the combination of locations selected by the optimisation method has shown a drop in spatial mean prediction error by 52%.

These results allow us to analyse the behaviour of the implicated vehicles based on the speed and the acceleration or deceleration of each trackpoint which composes the traces and compare them with the general official data published by the traffic authorities. The analysis of the results has demonstrated the viability of this methodology and its possible implementation by traffic authorities in order to obtain information to improve traffic safety.",30,12,2486,2505,Filter (signal processing); Acceleration; Data mining; GNSS applications; Anonymity; Geography; Volunteered geographic information; Upload,,10.1080/13658816.2016.1181265,2345809153

Citizen science is a quickly evolving field that is mobilizing people’s involvement in information development, social action and justice, and large-scale information gathering. Currently, a wide variety of terms and expressions are being used to refer to the concept of ‘citizen science’ and its practitioners. Here, we explore these terms to help provide guidance for the future growth of this field. We do this by reviewing the theoretical, historical, geopolitical, and disciplinary context of citizen science terminology; discussing what citizen science is and reviewing related terms; and providing a collection of potential terms and definitions for ‘citizen science’ and people participating in citizen science projects. This collection of terms was generated primarily from the broad knowledge base and on-the-ground experience of the authors, by recognizing the potential issues associated with various terms. While our examples may not be systematic or exhaustive, they are intended to be suggestive and invitational of future consideration. In our collective experience with citizen science projects, no single term is appropriate for all contexts. In a given citizen science project, we suggest that terms should be chosen carefully and their usage explained; direct communication with participants about how terminology affects them and what they would prefer to be called also should occur. We further recommend that a more systematic study of terminology trends in citizen science be conducted",2,1,1,,Participatory action research; Political science; Citizen science; Ontology; Community-based participatory research; Public relations; Knowledge base; Terminology; Crowdsourcing; Discipline,,10.5334/cstp.96,2623133424

In the last number of years there has been increased interest from researchers in investigating and understanding the characteristics and backgrounds of citizens who contribute to Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) and Citizen Science (CS) projects. Much of the reluctance from stakeholders such as National Mapping Agencies, Environmental Ministries, etc. to use data and information generated and collected by VGI and CS projects grows from the lack of knowledge and understanding about who these contributors are. As they are drawn from the crowd there is a sense of the unknown about these citizens. Subsequently there are justifiable concerns about these citizens’ ability to collect, generate and manage high quality and accurate spatial, scientific and environmental data and information. This paper provides a meta review of some of the key literature in the domain of VGI and CS to assess if these concerns are well founded and what efforts are ongoing to improve our understanding of the crowd.",II-3/W5,,339,343,Political science; Citizen science; Environmental data; Meta review; Lack of knowledge; Knowledge management; Volunteered geographic information,,10.5194/isprsannals-ii-3-w5-339-2015,2288471556

The open data movement promises to address this gap by offering alternative sources for information and free or low cost analytical platforms. However, in order to use open data effectively, urban managers and planners need guidance to navigate these new data sources, software, and server platforms, as well as acquire the necessary skills. In this paper, we begin to address these issues by developing a framework that organizes the sprawling and rapidly evolving world of open urban data. Our framework includes three broad categories (1) inputs and resources, (2) activities and outputs, and (3) outcomes. We then identify and describe the key subcomponents under each, and list the prominent products and resources available to urban managers and planners. For example, under inputs and resources, we discuss open urban data sources such as Open Street Maps, cyberinfrastructure for web hosting, application deployment, and data processing, and open source software that can be used to analyze and visualize collected or derived data. We also identify the key resources available to planners for training and discuss the complementary opportunities presented by conventional datasets such as census and open urban data. Finally, using examples from ongoing activities in Mumbai, we show how open data resources can be useful for understanding urbanization and better integrating informal settlements into formal urban management and planning processes. We suggest that urban managers and planners working in informal settlements should take greater advantage of open data resources in order to both better address current challenges as well as for shaping a better future for the communities they serve",4,2,74,91,Software deployment; Engineering; Data processing; Cyberinfrastructure; Software; Open data; Derived Data; Informal settlements; Urbanization; Knowledge management,,10.1016/j.jum.2015.12.001,2213455561

As with all VGI, however, there is uncertainty concerning data quality and fitness-for-use. Currently, the task of evaluating fitness-for-use of POI is left to the data user, with no guidance framework being available which is why this research proposes a generic approach to choose appropriate measures for assessing fitness-for-use of crowdsourced POI for different tasks. (2) Methods: POI are related to the higher-level concept of geo-atoms in order to identify and distinguish their two basic functions, geo-referencing and object-referencing. Then, for each of these functions, suitable measures of positional and thematic quality are developed based on existing quality indicators. (3) Results: Typical use cases of POI are evaluated with regards to their use of the two basic functions of POI, and allocated appropriate measures for fitness-for-use. The general procedure is illustrated on a brief practical example. (4) Conclusion: This research addresses the issue of fitness-for-use of POI on a higher conceptual level by relating it to more fundamental notions of geographical information representation.

Our goal is to introduce BikeMaps.org, a new website developed by the authors for crowd-source mapping of cycling collisions and near misses. BikeMaps.org is a global mapping system that allows citizens to map locations of cycling incidents and report on the nature of the event. Attributes collected are designed for spatial modeling research on predictors of safety and risk, and to aid surveillance and planning. Released in October 2014, within 2 months the website had more than 14,000 visitors and mapping in 14 countries. Collisions represent 38% of reports (134/356) and near misses 62% (222/356). In our pilot city, Victoria, Canada, citizens mapped data equivalent to about 1 year of official cycling collision reports within 2 months via BikeMaps.org. Using report completeness as an indicator, early reports indicate that data are of high quality with 50% being fully attributed and another 10% having only one missing attribute. We are advancing this technology, with the development of a mobile App, improved data visualization, real-time altering of hazard reports, and automated open-source tools for data sharing.

Remote sensing data, especially the nighttime light images, have been widely used to delineate urbanized areas across the world. Meanwhile, some emerging urban data, such as volunteered geographical information (e.g., OpenStreetMap) and social sensing data (e.g., mobile phone and social media), have also shown great potential in revealing urban boundaries and dynamics. However, consistent and robust methods to quantify urban areas from these multi-source data have remained elusive. Here, we propose a percolation-based method to extract urban areas from these multi-source urban data. We derive the optimal urban/non-urban threshold by considering the critical nature of urban systems with the support of the percolation theory. Furthermore, we apply the method with three open-source datasets – population, road, and nighttime light – to 28 countries. We show that the proposed method captures the similar urban characteristics in terms of urban areas from multi-source data, and Zipf's law holds well in most countries. The accuracy of the derived urban areas by different datasets has been validated with the Landsat-based reference data in 10 cities, and the accuracy can be further improved through data fusion (κ = 0.69–0.85, mean κ = 0.78). Our study not only provides an efficient method to quantify urban areas with open-source data, but also deepens the understanding of urban systems and sheds some light on multi-source data fusion in geographical fields.",241,,111730,,Percolation theory; Zipf's law; Percolation; Mobile phone; Reference data (financial markets); Population; Sensor fusion; Computer science; Social media; Cartography; Remote sensing,,10.1016/j.rse.2020.111730,3011301395

Vulnerability assessments for the Intermountain West regard wildlife and vegetation and their disturbance as two key resource areas in terms of ecosystems when considering climate change issues. Despite the adaptability potential of certain wildlife, increased temperature estimates of 1.67–2 °C by 2050 increase the likelihood and severity of droughts, floods, heatwaves and wildfires in Utah. As a consequence, resilient flora and fauna could be displaced. The aim of this study was to locate areas of habitat for an exemplary species, i.e., sage-grouse, based on current climate conditions and pinpoint areas of future habitat based on climate projections. The locations of wildlife were collected from Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) observations in addition to normal temperature and precipitation, vegetation cover and other ecosystem-related data. Four machine learning algorithms were then used to locate the current sites of wildlife habitats and predict suitable future sites where wildlife would likely relocate to, dependent on the effects of climate change and based on a timeframe of scientifically backed temperature-increase estimates. Our findings show that Random Forest outperforms other competing models, with an accuracy of 0.897, and a sensitivity and specificity of 0.917 and 0.885, respectively, and has great potential in Species Distribution Modeling (SDM), which can provide useful insights into habitat predictions. Based on this model, our predictions show that sage-grouse habitats in Utah will continue to decrease over the coming years due to climate change, producing a highly fragmented habitat and causing a loss of close to 70% of their current habitat. Priority Areas of Conservation (PACs) and protected areas might be deemed insufficient to halt this habitat loss, and more effort should be put into maintaining connectivity between patches to ensure the movement and genetic diversity within the sage-grouse population. The underlying data-driven methodical approach of this study could be useful for environmentalists, researchers, decision-makers, and policymakers, among others.</jats:p>",12,18,7657,,Effects of global warming; Machine learning; Climate change; Artificial intelligence; Vulnerability assessment; Vegetation; Habitat; Geography; Population; Wildlife; Habitat destruction,,10.3390/su12187657,3086420964

Although urban planning can thus be thought of as a field with significant ramifications on the human condition, many practitioners feel that it has reached the crossroads in thought leadership between traditional practice and a new, more participatory and open approach. Conventional ways to engage people in participatory planning exercises are limited in reach and scope. At the same time, socio-cultural trends and technology innovation offer opportunities to re-think the status quo in urban planning. Neogeography introduces tools and services that allow non-geographers to use advanced geographical information systems. Similarly, is there potential for the emergence of a neo-planning paradigm in which urban planning is carried out through active civic engagement aided by Web 2.0 and new media technologies thus redefining the role of practicing planners? This paper traces a number of evolving links between urban planning, neogeography and information and communication technology. Two significant trends – participation and visualisation – with direct implications for urban planning are discussed.

Contemporary approaches allow post-mortem feedback, where the consumer has to input detailed data of past travel experiences. Hence, it is hard to detect the location and time when and where the feedback was submitted, and in particular it is hard to trace the location of the incident that leads to the feedback (e.g. on which line/route, on which exact train the incident happened). Therefore we propose an approach for submitting feedback, that utilizes the current position of the customer. The approach draws on Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI), which is a special case of user–generated content coupled with participatory approaches in Geoinformation. Thus, the approach followed in this paper presents a concept that allows instant feedback, including the current position and timestamp. This approach allows the instant detection “where” an incident happened leading to costumer feedback (e.g. on which train, on which bus). A pilot implementation is tested and critically evaluated in a test region located in the municipality of Gratwein–Strasengel (Province of Styria, Austria). The experiment is conducted in a demand responsive transport system, where we monitor the feedback behavior of the customers using a smart-phone feedback application. The results show, that the concept utilizing VGI–methodologies was successfully applied to a demand responsive transport system. In addition, the results show that the approach provides instant feedback on problems and incidents for decision makers and transport managers, including the crucial information “where” and “when” something happened. In the first two weeks of operation, we received 55 customer feedbacks – of 175 ordered trips – of which the majority was positive and requested the transport service to be expanded in future.",,,538,545,Special case; Timestamp; TRIPS architecture; Citizen science; Citizen journalism; Computer science; Geographic information system; Operations research; Public transport; Volunteered geographic information,,10.1007/978-3-030-02305-8_65,2905522363

To create Geographic data, which is an important requirement in crisis situations, is time-consuming and costly when attempted to be produced by conventional methods. When the data is produced by volunteers, it is faster and less costly because experts try to reach and support the region.

Within this framework, there is a clear interest in better understanding how and why people value certain places over others. We introduce a new method that measures cultural preferences by exploring the potential of multiple online georeferenced digital photograph collections. Using ecological and social considerations, our study contributes to the detection of places that provide cultural ecosystem services. The degree of appreciation of a specific place is derived from the number of people taking and sharing pictures of it. The sequence of decisions and actions taken to share a digital picture of a given place includes the effort to travel to the place, the willingness to take a picture, the decision to geolocate the picture, and the action of sharing it through the Internet. Hence, the social activity of sharing pictures leaves digital proxies of spatial preferences, with people sharing specific photos considering the depicted place not only ""worth visiting"" but also ""worth sharing visually."" Using South Wales as a case study, we demonstrate how the proposed methodology can help identify key geographic features of high cultural value. These results highlight how the inclusion of geographical user-generated content, also known as volunteered geographic information, can be very effective in addressing some of the current priorities in conservation.

Ramirez Camargo; P. Hofmann,"Abstract. New contributions to disaster research need to address the increasing vulnerability of informal settlements in a changing climate situation. Informal settlements are frequently built in hazardous areas and are often left out of traditional disaster risk management concepts. Hence, formal and informal societal structures, as well as technical systems to warn against, handle or mitigate natural hazards, need to evolve. Within the project Inform@Risk we are addressing these issues based on a case study in Medellin (Colombia). Here, as a result of civil conflicts informal dwellings were partly constructed by people displaced from rural areas. They are mainly located in the urban peripheral areas along steep and unstable slopes, where the resettlement of all inhabitants at risk of landslides is unfeasible. This contribution presents the technical infrastructure and the concept to incorporate geodata from different sources in an integrated landslide early warning system for some selected informal settlements of Medellin. Special attention is given to possibilities on how building societal institutions, supported by information systems, increases local resilience. Using geoformation as a basis, we will combine classical participatory planning methods with digitally assisted concepts. These include combining satellite and UAS based remote sensing data with terrestrial sensor networks, crowd sourcing and citizen science to collect volunteered geographic information about the settlement and its environmental parameters, as well as distribute this information and disseminate warnings to the local population.",4238,,115,120,Business; Information system; Vulnerability; Disaster research; Early warning system; Participatory planning; Warning system; Risk management; Volunteered geographic information; Environmental planning,,,2970962456

Inspired by the visionary idea of Digital Earth, virtual globes are changing the way people approach to geographic information on the Web. Unlike the 2D visualization typical of Geographic Information Systems (GIS), virtual globes offer multi-dimensional, fully-realistic content visualization which allows for a much richer user experience. The proposed system should couple a powerful 3D visualization with an increase of public participation thanks to a tool allowing data collecting from mobile devices (e.g. smartphones and tablets). The participative application, built using the open source NASA World Wind virtual globe, is focused on the cultural and tourism heritage of Como city, located in Northern Italy. Users can create and manage customized projects and populate a catalogue of cartographic layers which is available to the entire community. Together with historical maps and the current cartography of the city, the system is also able to manage geo-tagged data, which come from user field-surveys performed through mobile devices in order to report POIs (Points Of Interest). Users can also extend POIs information adding more textual and multimedia contexts (e.g. images, audios and videos) directly on the globe.

The number of tourists and the tourism business opportunities brought by this festival has been increasing year by year, even reaching more than 1 million participating tourists/times ever since 2015. In terms of traditional assessment methods for great events, we used to obtain analytic information such as visitor satisfaction or the number of people through questionnaires. However, different levels of issues concerned by tourists cannot be easily understood through standardized questionnaires. Due to the popularization of online platforms and smart phones, people tend to voluntarily provide some information when they are participating in an activity. Such coordinated information is namely ""Volunteered geographic information"" (VGI), ex. ""check-in"" created by anyone. People can show their positive and negative messages by expressing their words about certain places (food, landscape, etc.), which can can make up for the shortcomings of traditional questionnaires. In this study, through the API provided by Facebook and by writing a web crawler program, we downloaded a total of 46,260 comments/messages written by people during the period of the Jazz Festival. Then, by means of Chinese word segmentation and through keywords, statistical analyses were conducted on two indicators shown by these tourists regarding the Jazz Festival: 1. Satisfaction about this event: To analyze people's positive and negative evaluations of the handling of this event, as well as their feelings; 2. Suggestions for event improvements: To analyze all aspects of concrete problems and suggestions for improvements proposed by people for this event. In this study, through collecting VGI data and constructing unstructured information analysis methods, explorations were made, concerning people's intuitive feeling about Jazz Festival from a mass perspective. In addition, comparisons and analyses against traditional questionnaires were conducted.

Such an interface plays a fundamental role in interactions for knowledge sharing and the exchange of ideas on campus. Due to campus public spaces generally being considered as the leftovers between buildings and classrooms, undermanaged, and overlooked, little is known about the extent to which this built environment enables or inhibits creative encounters in such spaces. The inner-city campuses and science parks (SPs) of Amsterdam and Utrecht, the case-studies of this research, differ in terms of their location relative to the city, their masterplan typologies and the arrangement of buildings. However, they are similar in terms of the aforementioned issues of public spaces. The novelty of this research is the attempt to overcome such issues using an innovative mixed-methods approach that tests the ‘spatial affordances for creativity’ with empirical data collection and analysis. This raises the importance of mapping, quantifying and analysing the spatial distribution of momentary perceptions, experiences, and feelings of people with methods such as volunteered geographic information (VGI). The results show that proximity between multiple urban functions and physical features, such as parks, cafes and urban seating are important when it comes to explaining the high frequency of creative encounters between people.

The authors have developed a method for generating a privacy-preserving heat map with user diversity (ppDIV), in which the density of trajectories, as well as the diversity of users, is taken into account, thus preventing the bias effects caused by participation inequality. The method is applied to public cycling workouts and compared with privacy-preserving kernel density estimation (ppKDE) focusing only on the density of the recorded trajectories and privacy-preserving user count calculation (ppUCC), which is similar to the quadrat-count of individual application users. An awareness of privacy was introduced to all methods as a data pre-processing step following the principle of k-Anonymity. Calibration results for the authors' heat maps using bicycle counting data gathered by the city of Helsinki are good (R2 > 0.7) and raise high expectations for utilizing heat maps in a city planning context. This is further supported by the diurnal distribution of the workouts indicating that, in addition to sports-oriented cyclists, many utilitarian cyclists are tracking their commutes.

Croyle,"Spatial analysis using maps to associate geographic information with disease can be traced as far back as the 17th century. Currently, the widespread diffusion of geospatial data acquisition technologies is enabling creation of highly accurate spatial (and temporal) data relevant to health research.; ; New approaches in geography and related fields, capitalizing on advances in technologies such as geographic information systems (GIS), the Global Positioning System (GPS), satellite remote sensing, and computer cartography, are often referred to collectively as geographic information science (1, 2). GPS and related systems make it possible to integrate highly accurate geographic location and time with virtually any observation. GIS provides the means to store, share, analyze, and visualize real-time and archived spatial data. It also permits the integration of multiple layers of interdisciplinary spatial data, such as health, environmental, genomic, social, or demographic data, for interactive spatial analysis and modeling.; ; Spatial and spatiotemporal statistical methods (3), such as multilevel analysis, spatial data mining, and agent-based modeling, provide ways of relating health and disease to specific genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors (4). The density, accuracy, and specificity of current geospatial data also facilitate sophisticated spatial and spatiotemporal analysis and the modeling of complex spatial health processes at the level of the individual rather than the aggregate (5, 6) (see the figure). Research based on data-intensive real-time GPS/GIS methods with miniaturized “wearable” environmental and biomedical monitors is generating advances in exposure assessment, as well as in mobility and obesity studies (7). In addition to individual interventions, this research can lead to outcomes such as the design of healthier environments which enhance access to parks and quality foods, and better treatment programs for a wide range of health conditions, from asthma to diabetes.; ; ; ; Figure; ; Exposure assessment with GPS/GIS data of individuals; ; ; ; GIS visualization and analytical tools also enable researchers to identify spatial patterns and to model specific processes of disease diffusion or contagion, such as of pandemic influenza viruses, or evolving genetic strains of hepatitis or tuberculosis. Researchers have integrated patient demographics, daily activities, and HIV viral concentrations to map and model changing spatial patterns of HIV infections and their relationships to health care treatment programs (8), or to social risk factors (9). Researchers have also used GIS data, spatial statistics, and interactive mapping to identify HIV concentration hotspots near the Mexico–U.S. border (10). This kind of GIS-based analysis enables proactive and timely delivery of tailored prevention and treatment strategies, such as HIV testing, antiretroviral therapy intervention, and education to the affected communities.; ; Geospatial data on health and social environments have also been used to provide information about health disparities. Using GIS-based ethnic density measures and spatial data on mothers’ residential locations, a recent study of infant health inequalities among Bangladeshi immigrant women in New York City found that their infants were most vulnerable to poor health outcomes, such as low birth weight, when living either in very isolated settings or in areas of the highest ethnic density (11).; ; With real-time interactive GPS/GIS functionality (12) now increasingly embedded in cell phones and low-cost navigation and other mobile devices, individual citizens also are contributing to the flow of health-related geospatial data. These activities are variously referred to as participatory GIS, crowd-sourcing, or volunteered geographic information (x). Despite unresolved issues of privacy and quality assurance, the ability to access georeferenced data from millions of people could be transformative.; ; For example, by analyzing data from 15 million mobile-phone subscribers, Wesolowski et al. (13) could examine the complex interactions between human and animal movements and the spread of malaria in Kenya. From Japan to California, volunteers with GPS-enabled real-time air-quality monitoring systems are assessing exposures to air pollution and radiation at spatial resolution levels and data densities not previously feasible (14).; ; Better institutional and educational models for successfully integrating the spatial dimension into health research and practice are needed to achieve the full benefits of these new capabilities in a timely manner (15, 16). There is also an urgent need for the creation of distributed, interoperable spatial data infrastructures to integrate health research data across and within disparate health research programs. In addition to fostering standards and scientific access, such large-scale spatial data infrastructures are themselves powerful new resources for generating and testing hypotheses, detecting spatial patterns, and responding to health threats.; ; Ongoing collaborations between the NIH and the Association of American Geographers are addressing key technical and institutional challenges (e.g., standards, interoperability, common terminology, data confidentiality) to facilitate the generation, coordination, and use of the rapidly growing body of geospatial health data (17). Research agendas that systematically incorporate spatial data and analysis into global health research hold extraordinary potential for creating new discovery pathways in science (18).",339,6126,1390,1392,GIS and public health; Spatial analysis; Spatial data infrastructure; Data science; Participatory GIS; Computer science; Geographic information system; Volunteered geographic information; Enterprise GIS; Geospatial analysis,,10.1126/science.1232257,2067982366

Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) here refers to a key component of such a phenomenon, comprising both a range of practices of geographic information production and dissemination by volunteers as well as new forms of geospatial data produced and curated through various interactive online platforms and mobile devices such as OpenStreetMap (OSM) and Google Maps. VGI constructions have raised questions on spatial knowledge, power, and context. Through a study that examines social constructions of OSM in China, this paper makes two contributions to the existing literature: providing a political economic account of VGI constructions in China and exploring legalities in VGI research. Informed by research in critical GIS, this paper traces political economic transitions in relation to OSM constructions and examines OSM contributors' experiences and how these experiences constitute OSM development and usage. Drawing upon law and society research, this paper investigates how OSM mappers encounter the state's regulatory scheme of online mapping. This legality perspective of spatial data production and usage is a topic rarely explored in VGI studies. With interview data and document analysis, this paper unravels processes of powerful state institutional arrangements to control and invest in VGI simultaneously, entrepreneurs' interest in developing location-based services using VGI data, and experiences from a tech-savvy group in exploring and making VGI. While individual experiences vary, they show efforts of questioning embedded power relations shaping spatial data production in these continuously evolving, contested technoscientific and social landscapes.",89,,73,82,Sociology; Spatial analysis; Social constructionism; Mobile device; Data science; Principle of legality; Volunteered geographic information; Human geography; Politics; Geospatial analysis,,10.1016/j.geoforum.2018.01.005,2788846323

The comparison shows how sense of place is dynamic and changing over time and explores Kilburn High Road through the categories of location, locale and sense of place derived from the qualitative analysis of VGI content and annotations. The contribution shows how VGI can contribute to discovering the unique relationship between people and place which takes the form given by Doreen Massey to Kilburn High Road and then moves on to the many forms given by people experiencing Kilburn High Road through a photo, a Tweet or a simple narrative.

Purves,"Describing current, past and future landscapes for inventory and policy making purposes requires classifications capturing variation in, for example, land use and land cover. Typical land cover classifi- cations for such purposes result from a top-down process and rely on expert conceptualisations, and thus provide limited space for incorporating more widely held views of key landscape elements. In this paper we introduce the notion of spatial folksonomies, which we define as a tuple linking a vocabulary of landscape terms through authors and resources to locations. We demonstrate how spatial folksonomies can automatically be created for Switzerland using two text corpora: the Swiss Alpine Club's yearbook for the past 150 years and user generated content from a website describing a wide range of outdoor ac- tivities. The spatial folksonomies capture variation in space of the use of nouns describing 96 natural landscape terms (e.g. ridge, forest, mountain, etc.) and allow us to characterise regions and compute similarities. We compare our spatial folksonomies to two traditional land cover/land use classifications (CORINE and Arealstatistik) and demonstrate that despite their very different sources, the approaches capture landscape variation in broadly similar ways. However, our spatial folksonomies provide new insights into how landscapes are described, through for example variation in space, time and through the prism of different activities. We argue that our spatial folksonomies are a novel way of capturing vari- ation closer to the bottom-up understandings of landscape for instance required to describe cultural ecosystem services",75,,60,70,User-generated content; Tuple; Natural landscape; Geography; Text corpus; Data science; Geographic information retrieval; Land cover; Land use; Cartography; Ecosystem services,,10.1016/j.apgeog.2016.08.005,2518067837

Purves; Duccio Rocchini; Ariane Walz,"Volunteered geographical information (VGI) and citizen science have become important sources data for much scientific research. In the domain of land cover, crowdsourcing can provide a high temporal resolution data to support different analyses of landscape processes. However, the scientists may have little control over what gets recorded by the crowd, providing a potential source of error and uncertainty. This study compared analyses of crowdsourced land cover data that were contributed by different groups, based on nationality (labelled Gondor and Non-Gondor) and on domain experience (labelled Expert and Non-Expert). The analyses used a geographically weighted model to generate maps of land cover and compared the maps generated by the different groups. The results highlight the differences between the maps how specific land cover classes were under- and over-estimated. As crowdsourced data and citizen science are increasingly used to replace data collected under the designed experiment, this paper highlights the importance of considering between group variations and their impacts on the results of analyses. Critically, differences in the way that landscape features are conceptualised by different groups of contributors need to be considered when using crowdsourced data in formal scientific analyses. The discussion considers the potential for variation in crowdsourced data, the relativist nature of land cover and suggests a number of areas for future research. The key finding is that the veracity of citizen science data is not the critical issue per se. Rather, it is important to consider the impacts of differences in the semantics, affordances and functions associated with landscape features held by different groups of crowdsourced data contributors.",11,7,e0158329,,Geoinformatics; Semantics; Citizen science; Geography; Data science; Land cover; Social media; Volunteered geographic information; Crowdsourcing; Scientific method,,10.1371/journal.pone.0158329,2489882500

Ariannamazi; Farid Karimipour; Farshad Hakimpour,"<jats:p>Abstract. Rapid development of crowd-sourcing or volunteered geographic information (VGI) provides opportunities for authoritatives that deal with geospatial information. Heterogeneity of multiple data sources and inconsistency of data types is a key characteristics of VGI datasets. The expansion of cities resulted in the growing number of POIs in the OpenStreetMap, a well-known VGI source, which causes the datasets to outdate in short periods of time. These changes made to spatial and aspatial attributes of features such as names and addresses might cause confusion or ambiguity in the processes that require feature’s literal information like addressing and geocoding. VGI sources neither will conform specific vocabularies nor will remain in a specific schema for a long period of time. As a result, the integration of VGI sources is crucial and inevitable in order to avoid duplication and the waste of resources. Information integration can be used to match features and qualify different annotation alternatives for disambiguation. This study enhances the search capabilities of geospatial tools with applications able to understand user terminology to pursuit an efficient way for finding desired results. Semantic web is a capable tool for developing technologies that deal with lexical and numerical calculations and estimations. There are a vast amount of literal-spatial data representing the capability of linguistic information in knowledge modeling, but these resources need to be harmonized based on Semantic Web standards. The process of making addresses homogenous generates a helpful tool based on spatial data integration and lexical annotation matching and disambiguating.;                     </jats:p>",XL-1/W5,,63,66,Semantic integration; Semantic Web; Information retrieval; Knowledge modeling; Ambiguity; Information integration; Computer science; Geocoding; Volunteered geographic information; Geospatial analysis,,10.5194/isprsarchives-xl-1-w5-63-2015,2571201574

Arguably, nonscientist local stakeholders have always played an important role in knowledge risk management and resilience building within a hydrological context, such as flood response and drought alleviation. However, rapidly developing information and communication technologies such as the Internet, smartphones, and social media have already demonstrated their sizeable potential to make knowledge creation more multidirectional, decentralized, diverse, and inclusive. Combined with technologies for robust and low-cost sensor networks, a ‘citizen science’ approach has recently emerged as a promising direction in the provision of extensive, real-time information for risk management. Such projects work best when there is community buy-in, when their purpose(s) are clearly defined at the outset, and when the motivations and skillsets of all participants and stakeholders are well understood. They have great potential to enhance knowledge creation, not only for data collection, but also for analysis or interpretation. In addition, they can serve as a means of educating and empowering communities and stakeholders that are bypassed by more traditional knowledge generation processes. Here, we review the state-of-the-art of citizen science within the context of hydrological risk reduction and resilience building. Particularly when embedded within a polycentric approach toward risk governance, we argue that citizen science could complement more traditional knowledge generation practices, and also enhance innovation, adaptation, multidirectional information provision, risk management, and local resilience building",5,1,e1262,,Environmental resource management; Engineering; Citizen science; Citizen journalism; Public participation; Risk governance; Risk management; Traditional knowledge; Knowledge management; Information and Communications Technology; Resource management,,10.1002/wat2.1262,2766724703

These techniques however, are often cumbersome and costly, allocating large amounts of technical and temporal costs. The technological advances of web 2.0 have brought a wide array of technological achievements, stimulating the participatory role in collaborative and crowd sourced mapping products. This has been fostered by GPS-enabled devices, and accessible tools that enable visual interpretation of high resolution satellite images/air photos provided in collaborative mapping projects. Such technologies offer an integrative approach to geography by means of promoting public participation and allowing accurate assessment and classification of land use as well as geographical features. OpenStreetMap (OSM) has supported the evolution of such techniques, contributing to the existence of a large inventory of spatial land use information. This paper explores the introduction of this novel participatory phenomenon for land use classification in Europe's metropolitan regions. We adopt a positivistic approach to assess comparatively the accuracy of these contributions of OSM for land use classifications in seven large European metropolitan regions. Thematic accuracy and degree of completeness of OSM data was compared to available Global Monitoring for Environment and Security Urban Atlas (GMESUA) datasets for the chosen metropolises. We further extend our findings of land use within a novel framework for geography, justifying that volunteered geographic information (VGI) sources are of great benefit for land use mapping depending on location and degree of VGI dynamism and offer a great alternative to traditional mapping techniques for metropolitan regions throughout Europe. Evaluation of several land use types at the local level suggests that a number of OSM classes (such as anthropogenic land use, agricultural and some natural environment classes) are viable alternatives for land use classification. These classes are highly accurate and can be integrated into planning decisions for stakeholders and policymakers.",35,,329,337,Environmental resource management; Metropolitan area; Citizen science; Geography; Dynamism; Public participation; Land use; Collaborative mapping; Volunteered geographic information; Thematic map,,10.1016/j.jag.2014.09.009,2019459432

This technical note develops a method of assessing how successful cities have been as entertainment locales using one type of volunteered geographic information: online restaurant reviews. Rather than constructing a complex entertainment index, the number of “destination restaurants” in a city center can be used as a shorthand indicator. An exploration of the functionality and data extraction possibilities of multiple U.S.-based restaurant review sites determined that Yelp is the most useful site for the purpose of this research. Yelp's functionality and comprehensiveness allow a researcher to discriminate between destination restaurants and other restaurant listings that do not contribute to a city's overall entertainment potential.

Until now, studies have focused primarily on developed countries, showing that VGI content can match or even surpass the quality of authoritative sources, with very few studies in developing countries. In this paper, we compare the quality of authoritative (data from the Regional Center for Mapping of Resources for Development (RCMRD)) and non-authoritative (data from OSM and Google’s Map Maker) road data in conjunction with population data in and around Nairobi, Kenya. Results show variability in coverage between all of these datasets.

However, there are also concerns surrounding uneven levels of participation and spatial coverage, despite the promotion of VGI as a means to increase access to geographic knowledge production. To begin addressing these concerns, this research examines the spatial distribution and data richness of urban forest VGI in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and San Francisco, California. Using ordinary least squares (OLS), general linear models (GLM), and spatial autoregressive models, our findings reveal that sociodemographic and environmental indicators are strong predictors of both densities of attributed trees and data richness. Although recent digital urban tree inventory applications present significant opportunities for collaborative data gathering, innovative research, and improved policymaking, asymmetries in the quantity and quality of the data may undermine their effectiveness.

These challenges require an intelligent response from society, which in turn requires access to information about the Earth System. This information comes from observations and prior knowledge, the latter typically embodied in a model describing relationships between variables of the Earth System. Data assimilation provides an objective methodology to combine observational and model information to provide an estimate of the most likely state and its uncertainty for the whole Earth System. This approach adds value to the observations – by filling in the spatio-temporal gaps in observations; and to the model – by constraining it with the observations. In this review paper we motivate data assimilation as a methodology to fill in the gaps in observational information; illustrate the data assimilation approach with examples that span a broad range of features of the Earth System (atmosphere, including chemistry; ocean; land surface); and discuss the outlook for data assimilation, including the novel application of data assimilation ideas to observational information obtained using Citizen Science. Ultimately, a strong motivation of data assimilation is the many benefits it provides to users.

ALS data is represented in the form of a point cloud with recorded multiple returns and intensities. In our work, we combined OBIA with ALS point cloud data in order to identify and extract buildings as 2D polygons representing roof outlines in a top down mapping approach. We performed rasterization of the ALS data into a height raster for the purpose of the generation of a Digital Surface Model (DSM) and a derived Digital Elevation Model (DEM). Further objects were generated in conjunction with point statistics from the linked point cloud. With the use of class modelling methods, we generated the final target class of objects representing buildings. The approach was developed for a test area in Biberach an der Ris (Germany). In order to point out the possibilities of the adaptation-free transferability to another data set, the algorithm has been applied “as is” to the ISPRS Benchmarking data set of Toronto (Canada).

As many higher order phenomena are only vaguely defined, this paper develops and evaluates a methodology to acquire definitional knowledge about geographic phenomena by participant experiments and use this knowledge to drive the cartographic pattern recognition process.

We propose the concept of ‘brands of youth citizenship’ to understand recent shifts in the state promotion of citizenship formations for young people, and demonstrate how scale is crucial to that agenda. As such, we push forward debates on the scaling of citizenship more broadly through an examination of the imaginative and institutional geographies of learning to be a citizen. The paper's empirical focus is a state-funded youth programme in the UK – National Citizen Service – launched in 2011 and now reaching tens of thousands of 15–17 year olds. We demonstrate the ‘branding’ of youth citizenship, cast here in terms of social action and designed to create a particular type of citizen-subject. Original research with key architects, delivery providers and young people demonstrates two key points of interest. First, that the scales of youth citizenship embedded in NCS promote engagement at the local scale, as part of a national collective, whilst the global scale is curiously absent. Second, that discourses of youth citizenship are increasingly mobilised alongside ideas of Britishness yet fractured by the geographies of devolution. Overall, the paper explores the scalar politics and performance of youth citizenship, the tensions therein, and the wider implications of this study for both political geographers and society more broadly at a time of heated debate about youthful politics in the United Kingdom and beyond",56,,66,76,Kingdom; Sociology; Devolution; Britishness; Citizenship; Media studies; Local scale; Original research; Youth studies; Public administration; Politics,,10.1016/j.polgeo.2016.11.007,2552840309

This work is part of LandSense European H2020 project aiming to build a citizen platform for monitoring Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) data by integrating different types of information such as citizens-contributed data and proposing a set of services (Matheus et al., 2018). One of the pilot studies proposed in LandSense is to monitor urban dynamics to complement authoritative data sources. In this context, one of the goals of the French Mapping Agency (IGN France) is to study the potential of volunteered geographic information (VGI) (Goodchild, 2007) to enrich and update LULC authoritative database by engaging with citizens and several public authorities. The targeted database is OCS-GE containing LULC data (vector polygons) which is produced by IGN France for a 1 : 5.000 scale use. A specificity of OCS-GE database is that both classes LU and LC are assigned to each polygon. Two distinct nomenclatures are in fact defined, each one containing three hierarchical levels. Though in the database, some of the classes are merged due to lack of in-situ information. It is especially the case for some LU classes. Another characteristic is that the database is dated (i.e. represents LULC at a given year) without intermediate versions between two releases (generally every 3 years). Thus, in this context three needs are identified: Detect LULC changes in order to facilitate updates in the next dated version of OCS-GE. Improve LULC data by dividing the merged classes in the database to better match the nomenclature. Update LULC data corresponding to the year of the OCS-GE (for the moment 2013 and 2016).",1,,1,2,Polygon; Land cover; Computer science; Land use; Volunteered geographic information; Cartography,,10.5194/ica-abs-1-152-2019,2961463659

For the classification of the Web-based enriched sensor data, the system employs a random decision forest (RDF) (which compared favorably for the geoannotation task against different classification algorithms). The accuracy of the novel bike-sensing system is 92% for six-class road/terrain classification and 97% for two-class on-road/off-road classification. Since the evaluation is performed on large-scale data gathered during real bike runs, these ""real-life"" accuracies show the feasibility of our novel approach.",31,5,101,111,Statistical classification; Data mining; RDF; Terrain; Random forest; Web service; Computer science; Volunteered geographic information; Global Positioning System; Accelerometer,,10.1109/msp.2014.2329379,2006172172

This article introduces an approach toward generating land-use patterns from volunteered geographic information VGI without applying remote-sensing techniques and/or engaging official data. Hence, collaboratively collected OpenStreetMap OSM data sets are employed to map land-use patterns in Vienna, Austria. Initially the spatial pattern of the landscape was delineated and thereafter the most relevant land type was assigned to each land parcel through a hierarchical GIS-based decision tree approach. To evaluate the proposed approach, the results are compared with the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security Urban Atlas GMESUA data. The results are compared in two ways: first, the texture of the resulting land-use patterns is analyzed using texture-variability analysis. Second, the attributes assigned to each land segment are evaluated. The achieved land-use map shows kappa indices of 91, 79, and 76% agreement for location in comparison with the GMESUA data set at three levels of classification. Furthermore, the attributes of the two data sets match at 81, 67, and 65%. The results demonstrate that this approach opens a promising avenue to integrate freely available VGI to map land-use patterns for environmental planning purposes.",27,12,2264,2278,Geography; Land type; Land parcel; Land use; Volunteered geographic information; Data set; Cartography; Decision tree,,10.1080/13658816.2013.800871,2003425021

This study recognises that creativity is the fourth sustainability, because the spatial configuration of campuses and city-university accessibilities are ‘creative solutions’ conceived for human needs. At the same time, creative ideas depend on interactions between individuals and the built environment. Therefore, based on the theoretical framework of the scholars who have explored the spatial aspects of creativity, this study empirically investigates Zernike Campus, Groningen, and its public spaces using a mixed-methods approach that involves (1) a space syntax analysis of the campus’s spatial configuration, (2) volunteered geographic information (VGI) of the users’ perceptions, and (3) non-participatory observations of the interactions between people and the built environment in public spaces with high and low ‘potential for creativity’. The results show that creativity cannot be explained simply by analysing spatial configurations, but that it also depends on the combination of the land-use mix, physical features, positive experiences, and perceptions of a sense of place which enable trust and interactions, and which facilitate creative encounters. Therefore, the mixed-methods approach applied here can help urban planners and designers to address public spaces more effectively, integrating conditions that support creativity.",12,21,9263,,Creativity; Sense of place; Sociology; Mathematics education; Built environment; Fundamental human needs; Urban design; Space syntax; Public space; Volunteered geographic information,,10.3390/su12219263,3094904180

Shiau; Chi-Yo Huang; Chia Lee Yang; Jer Nan Juang,"Geographic information is a confluence of knowledge from spatial science, information technologies, engineering, and mathematics, etc. Effective spatial training can enhance achievement in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. Therefore, the geographic information system (GIS) plays a daily role in modern STEM education. Volunteered Geographical Information (VGI) is characterized by the openness of the geographic information being generated and accumulated by volunteers. Within the VGI sphere, OpenStreetMap (OSM) is one of the most well-known VGI due to its openness, flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and web-based mapping capability, making it one of the best alternatives for use as the mapping application for STEM education. However, very few or no prior works have investigated the factors influencing the innovation diffusion of OSM in STEM education. Therefore, to fill this gap, this work aims to investigate these factors. To achieve this purpose, the authors have defined an analytic framework based on innovation diffusion theory (IDT) and the technology acceptance model (TAM). The factors influencing students’ acceptance and intention to continue using and diffusing OSM in STEM education will be investigated. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used to confirm the hypothesized IDT–TAM integrated model. An empirical study based on sample data collected from 145 Taiwanese undergraduate and graduate students from engineering-related institutes was used to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed analytic framework and to derive the factors related to the adoption and diffusion of OSM in STEM education. The proposed theoretical framework forged in this study was proven to be successful. Based on the empirical study results, ease of use, observability, and compatibility are the most influential factors in OSM diffusion. Therefore, activities that enhance the ease of use, observability, and compatibility of OSM should be emphasized so that STEM students’ perception of the usefulness of the technology and their perceived attitude towards it leads to the intention to continue the use of OSM. The analytic results can serve as a foundation for the design, development, and accelerated adoption and diffusion of OSM in STEM education.",10,10,3447,,Empirical research; Information technology; Usability; Technology acceptance model; Geographic information system; Knowledge management; Volunteered geographic information; Structural equation modeling; Openness to experience,,10.3390/su10103447,2893328597

However, while bias in contributors is well known, we know less about whether this also results in a bias in outcomes on these websites: or whether the partial portion of the population which does make contributions also works to “fill in the blanks”, by adding knowledge about other less well-off neighbouring areas which have not attracted a contributor base. This article addresses the question of whether such “neighbourhood effects” exist in practice. It makes use of a novel dataset of alcohol license data in the UK to assess variation in the completeness of the volunteer geographic information site OpenStreetMap. The results support existing literature in showing that completeness is related to demographics: areas with higher levels of wealth and education typically exhibit higher levels of completeness. The article then makes a novel contribution by showing evidence of the existence of neighbourhood effects: poorer regions with more affluent neighbours typically having higher levels of completeness than poorer regions which are also surrounded by poorer neighbours.

Frank,"<jats:p>Abstract. Since the use of volunteered geographic information (VGI) or crowd sourced data (Goodchild, 2007) became more common, several people proposed the use of such methods of data collection for various fields. Success stories were Wikipedia encyclopaedia and OpenStreetMap (OSM), but also using VGI in land administration has been proposed. Robin McLaren proposed crowd sourcing as a way to get a new citizen collaboration model in land administration to enhance transparency and decrease costs (McLaren, 2011). Keenja et al. discussed the perception of VGI within the Dutch cadastre (Keenja, De Vries, Bennet, &amp;amp; Laarakker, 2012). Basiouka and Potsiou even discuss how crowd sourcing can be used to identify errors in the Hellenic cadastre (Basiouka &amp;amp; Potsiou, 2012). One problem of VGI is the quality control (compare Goodchild &amp;amp; Li, 2012). The problem with most data in a land administration system is that there is only a small group of people that can verify the correctness of information. The correct location of a boundary, for example, can only be assessed by the owners of the pieces of land touching at the boundary (and surveyors after investigation and measurement). How shall VGI then provide reliable data? Boundaries between areas of different use may be visible but land administration is often interested in ownership boundaries. In the paper we discuss the types of data used in land administration as discussed by Dale and McLaughlin (1999). These categories are then analyzed to identify the areas where VGI can actually provide reliable input. What we hope to learn from such an analysis is how to use the methodology of crowd sourcing for land administration, even if the data collection authoritatively.;                     </jats:p>",XL-2/W1,1,159,163,Data collection; Cadastre; Data type; Encyclopedia; Geography; Data science; Land administration; Operations research; Correctness; Volunteered geographic information; Transparency (graphic),,10.5194/isprsarchives-xl-2-w1-159-2013,2132643790

These spatiotemporal data are often distributed in different databases and exist in heterogeneous forms, even when they refer to the same geospatial entities. Besides, existing open standards lack sufficient expression of the attribute semantics. Client applications or other services thus have to deal with unrelated preprocessing tasks, such as data transformation and attribute annotation, leading to potential inconsistencies. Furthermore, to build informative interfaces that guide users to quickly understand the analysis methods, an analysis service needs to explicitly model the method parameters, which are often interrelated and have rich auxiliary information. This work presents the design of the spatial data linkage and analysis services in a geoportal for China urban research. The spatial data linkage service aggregates multisource heterogeneous data into linked layers with flexible attribute mapping, providing client applications and services with a unified access as if querying a big table. The spatial analysis service incorporates parameter hierarchy and grouping by extending the standard WPS service, and data-dependent validation in computation components.

Recently, large corporations including Apple, Microsoft, and Facebook have been hiring editors to contribute to the OSM database. In this article, we explore the influence these corporate editors are having on the map by first considering the history of corporate involvement in the community and then analyzing historical quarterly-snapshot OSM-QA-Tiles to show where and what these corporate editors are mapping. Cumulatively, millions of corporate edits have a global footprint, but corporations vary in geographic reach, edit types, and quantity. While corporations currently have a major impact on road networks, non-corporate mappers edit more buildings and points-of-interest: representing the majority of all edits, on average. Since corporate editing represents the latest stage in the evolution of corporate involvement, we raise questions about how the OSM community—and researchers—might proceed as corporate editing grows and evolves as a mechanism for expanding the map for multiple uses.",8,5,232,,Business; Data quality; Data science; Open data; Road networks; Volunteered geographic information; Geospatial analysis,,10.3390/ijgi8050232,2946303255

The Safecast data are calibrated using observations acquired by the U.S. Department of Energy at the time of the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi power plant nuclear accident. The methodology performs a series of interpolations between the U.S. government and contributed datasets at specific temporal windows and at corresponding spatial locations. The coefficients found for all the different temporal windows are aggregated and interpolated using quadratic regressions to generate a time dependent calibration function. Normal background radiation, decay rates, and missing values are taken into account during the analysis. Results show that the standard Safecast static transformation function overestimates the official measurements because it fails to capture the presence of two different Cesium isotopes and their changing magnitudes with time. A model is created to predict the ratio of the isotopes from the time of the accident through 2020. The proposed time dependent calibration takes into account this Cesium isotopes ratio, and it is shown to reduce the error between U.S. government and contributed data. The proposed calibration is needed through 2020, after which date the errors introduced by ignoring the presence of different isotopes will become negligible.",190-191,,51,65,Transformation (function); Quadratic equation; Isotope; Calibration; Interpolation; Background radiation; Cesium Isotopes; Environmental science; Remote sensing; Missing data,Citizen science; Data calibration; Fukushima Daiichi; Safecast data; Volunteered geographic information,10.1016/j.jenvrad.2018.04.018,2804611721

Despite considerable effort over the past decade, our capacity to quantify the value of GI or even understand how value should be conceptualized remains limited. The recent emergence of volunteered geographic information (VGI) has introduced several new facets to the challenge of understanding the value of (V)GI. This chapter examines how VGI use and production are challenging our understanding of how GI and VGI alike are valued. Following a review of the traditional approaches to valuing GI, the chapter explores the distinctive characteristics of VGI use and production that introduce new dimensions to value. More specifically, the chapter proposes several metaphors (serendipitous and unexpected discovery, Debord’s ‘Derives’ metaphor, Lego block theory) that can be used to conceptualize VGI value and the potential to adapt the ‘fitness-for-use’ concept to guide user assessments of VGI value in practice.",,,15,29,Sociology; Spatial analysis; Spatial data infrastructure; Data science; Metaphor; Block theory; Volunteered geographic information,,10.1007/978-94-007-4587-2_2,10709905

Holt,"In this issue of Preventing Chronic Disease, Moodley et al (1) present the results of a spatial analysis of the locations of advertisements for sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) and vendors who sell SSBs in relation to the location of schools in 5 neighborhoods in South Africa. In their article, “Obesogenic Environments: Access to and Advertising of Sugar-Sweetened Beverages in Soweto, South Africa,” the authors used a global positioning system (GPS) and a digital camera to gather data on the locations of SSB advertisements and vendors. Their innovative and low-cost approach could be replicated in any setting, including the United States, where time-sensitive point-location data on environmental exposure are needed but are unavailable through more traditional data-collection sources. In this sense, their approach to gathering data is situated within the broader technological developments of volunteered geographic information, crowdsourced data, and GPS-enabled mobile technology for public health (2–6).; ; Although the main objective of Moodley et al was to provide a descriptive analysis of the intensity of SSB advertising, their approach to using technology deserves to be highlighted because it may be of great value to public health practitioners. To this end, Preventing Chronic Disease readers may find valuable some additional examples of the use of handheld GPS devices or smartphones for data collection for chronic disease epidemiology. Smartphones are GPS-enabled, and photographs taken with smartphone cameras are encoded with a GPS location. Software applications for smartphones that allow photographs to be exported and their location information to be stored on a convenient database include commercial applications such as Collector for ArcGIS (Esri, http://doc.arcgis.com/en/collector/) and open-source free applications such as Ushahidi (www.ushahidi.com/product/ushahidi/).; ; Many recently published studies illustrate how this technological approach has been used in the field. Braun et al (7) provided a comprehensive review of the use of mobile technology for field data collection among community health workers. Aanensen et al (8) described the development of a system to link smartphones to Web applications for the collection of field data, which can include GPS locations, photographs, videos, and audio. Chunara and colleagues (9) cited examples of mobile technology use for rapid reporting of outbreak information, such as malaria in Cambodia. Patel et al (10) described the development and implementation of a smartphone application to measure the presence of smoking in vehicles, in addition to the presence of adult passengers, child passengers, or both; they also stress the advantages of efficiency and standardization and the ability to transmit data from many remote locations to a centralized website for further analysis. Kanter and colleagues (11) developed, field tested, and evaluated a mobile telephone–based nutrition environment survey in Guatemalan supermarkets, and they noted that the mobile application had equivalent reliability and validity to a paper version of the survey and was also faster to use. King et al (12) reviewed advances in and issues related to using mobile technologies to assess the built environment for the purpose of improving active living and healthy eating. Eyler et al (13), in a presentation of case studies for the assessment of physical activity and the built environment, described the development of an iPad application (named iSOPARC) that enables users to collect and manage data elements for the System for Observing Play and Recreation in Communities (SOPARC), which has been validated and in use since 2004. The goal of the mobile application was to increase the use of SOPARC by making it more accessible to a broader range of end users.; ; Bethlehem et al (14) discussed a different approach to using digital technology to assess neighborhood obesogenic characteristics; instead of collecting data in the field, they remotely analyzed digital photographs from Google Earth and Google Street View. In both cases, they found that assessments were valid and reliable and could be completed in roughly one-half the time as field-based data collection. One drawback of this approach is that not all potential areas of interest have been imaged for Google Earth and Google Street View, particularly areas where cars are prohibited. Furthermore, the date of image collection is not controlled by the health researcher, so a large study may contain data obtained at different times. Nonetheless, this approach is an interesting area for further development and highlights the innovative ways in which digital data are being used.; ; Mobile technology is changing rapidly, and so are the innovative applications for using it. Curtis et al (15) collected street-level spatial video data in a Haitian community through the analysis of 4 automobile-mounted digital video cameras. The spatial video was viewed in Google Earth, and environmental attributes of interest (eg, standing water, trash, structural integrity of homes) were manually coded; the resulting data were exported to ArcGIS (Esri) for further spatial analysis. As a sign of applications to come, Igoe et al (16) discussed the feasibility of using smartphones for real-time measurement of ultraviolet A (UVA) radiation and aerosol optical depth, both of which are measures of the physical environment that can affect health. It is not too great a stretch to imagine the near future when our smartphones or wearable technology may be able to measure UVA radiation and provide real-time recommendations for limiting sun exposure.; ; Moodley et al provide a case study of how a group of researchers with a defined research question for a well-documented public health concern used readily available low-cost technology to create a unique spatial database of environmental exposures. This approach has relevance to many different geographic settings and exposures, including data that may be available from commercial vendors but prohibitively expensive (eg, business and marketing data), as well as exposures that are more ephemeral, such as advertising billboards, where existing data sets may not be current for the period studied. Their data collection methods can be adopted by researchers and communities interested in various chronic disease–related exposures or assets (either harmful or protective), such as alcohol and tobacco advertising, fast-food outlets, and farmers markets. Public health practitioners could either adopt their approach of using a handheld GPS in combination with a digital camera or use similar approaches that are available through ready-made commercial or open-source smartphone applications, as this brief sampling of literature suggests.",12,,E187,,Data collection; Built environment; Mobile device; Assisted GPS; Data science; Environmental exposure; Volunteered geographic information; Mobile technology; Medicine; End user,,10.5888/pcd12.150400,1852889913

The main application of our work is for stakeholders involved in humanitarian demining. We provide them with a comprehensive framework for visualizing ERW hazards at the geographical scale at which they have to make decisions, as well as customized cartographic visualization tools and recommendations to help them make informed decisions. For example, we provide potential donors with a method for obtaining a global overview of ERW contamination while remaining aware of regional variation and hot spots. We also enhance cartographic visualization capabilities using traditional kernel density estimation by customizing key parameters. Specifically, we propose a method for adjusting kernel bandwidth for datasets with highly heterogeneous spatial distributions and a method for generating kernel surfaces from polygon data that consists of infilling the polygons with points before using them as inputs in the kernel density estimation",41,,179,194,Data mining; Polygon; Geography; Data science; Data sharing; Mine action; Kernel Bandwidth; Visualization; Database administrator; Kernel density estimation; Kernel (linear algebra),,10.1016/j.apgeog.2013.04.007,2042139695

To provide a PNS for the transportation of vulnerable people, more detailed information of pedestrian facilities and obstructions should be included in Pedestrian Network Data (PND) used for PNS. Such data can be constructed efficiently by collecting GPS trajectories and integrating them with the existing PND. However, these two kinds of data have geometric differences and topological inconsistencies that need to be addressed. In this paper, we provide a methodology for integrating pedestrian facilities and obstructions information with an existing PND. At first we extracted the significant points from user-collected GPS trajectory by identifying the geometric difference index and attributes of each point. Then the extracted points were used to make an initial solution of the matching between the trajectory and the PND. Two geometrical algorithms were proposed and applied to reduce two kinds of errors in the matching: on dual lines and on intersections. Using the final solution for the matching, we reconstructed the node/link structure of PND including the facilities and obstructions information. Finally, performance was assessed with a test site and 79.2% of the collected data were correctly integrated with the PND.",15,9,24466,24486,Data mining; Trajectory; Geography; Transport engineering; Pedestrian; Network data; Gps trajectory; Poison control; Geographic information system; Volunteered geographic information; Global Positioning System,facilities and obstructions; pedestrian navigation service; pedestrian network data; transportation of vulnerable people; volunteered geographic information,10.3390/s150924466,2112314383

By using location-aware devices such as smartphones to collect geographic information in the form of geo-tagged text, photos, or videos, and sharing this information through online social media, such as Twitter, citizens create Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI). To effectively use this information for disaster management, we developed a VGI framework for the discovery of VGI. This framework consists of four components: (i) a VGI brokering module to provide a standard service interface to retrieve VGI from multiple resources based on spatial, temporal, and semantic parameters; (ii) a VGI quality control component, which employs semantic filtering and cross-referencing techniques to evaluate VGI; (iii) a VGI publisher module, which uses a service-based delivery mechanism to disseminate VGI, and (iv) a VGI discovery component to locate, browse, and query metadata about available VGI datasets. In a case study we employed a FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) strategy, open standards/specifications, and free/open data to show the utility of the framework. We demonstrate that the framework can facilitate data discovery for disaster management.

IPM has been deployed to achieve the judicious use of pesticides and has become one of the most important methods of securing agricultural productivity. Despite the efforts made to strengthen IPM during the past decades, overuse as well as indiscriminate use of pesticides is still common. This problem is particularly serious in underserved farming communities which suffer from ineffectiveness with respect to pest management information collection and dissemination. The recent development of volunteered geographic information (VGI) offers an opportunity to the general public to create and receive ubiquitous, cost-effective, and timely geospatial information. Therefore, this study proposes to enhance IPM through establishing a VGI-based IPM. As a starting point of this line of research, this study explored how such geospatial information can contribute to IPM enhancement. Based on this, a conceptual framework of VGI interaction was built to guide the establishment of VGI-based IPM. To implement VGI-based IPM, a mobile phone platform was developed. In addition, a case study was conducted in the town of Shuibian in Jiangxi province of China to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. In the case study, by analyzing infestation incidents of an overwintering outbreak of striped rice stem borers voluntarily reported by farmers through mobile phones, spatiotemporal infestation patterns of the borers throughout the study area were revealed and disseminated to the farmers. These patterns include the dates and degree-days the pest infestations intensified, and the orientation or spatial structural variations of the clustering of the infestations. This case study showcased the unique merit of VGI in enhancing IPM, namely the acquisition of previously unrecorded spatial data in a cost-effective and real-time manner for discovering and disseminating previously unknown pest management knowledge.",6,7,224,,Dissemination; Agriculture; Integrated pest management; Agricultural productivity; Conceptual framework; Ecology; Geography; Mobile phone; Volunteered geographic information; Environmental planning; Geospatial analysis,,10.3390/ijgi6070224,2738676247

As a major part of the cryosphere, snow cover also represents a valuable terrestrial water resource. In the context of climate change, the dynamics of snow cover play a crucial role in rebalancing the global energy and water budgets. Remote sensing, hydrological modeling and in situ observations are three techniques frequently utilized for snow cover investigations. However, the uncertainties caused by systematic errors, scale gaps, and complicated snow physics, among other factors, limit the usability of these three approaches in snow studies. In this paper, an overview of the advantages, limitations and recent progress of the three methods is presented, and more effective ways to estimate snow cover properties are evaluated. The possibility of improving remotely sensed snow information using ground-based observations is discussed. As a rapidly growing source of volunteered geographic information (VGI), web-based geotagged photos have great potential to provide ground truth data for remotely sensed products and hydrological models and thus contribute to procedures for cloud removal, correction, validation, forcing and assimilation. Finally, this review proposes a synergistic framework for the future of snow cover research.

With the development of location-based services and the rapid increase in volunteered geographic information and social media data, the amount of point data is increasing day by day, resulting in inevitable problems of overlay and congestion during visualization. Map generalization provides multiple algorithms that can be used to select, aggregate and make typification of points or point clusters. For the generalization of point data, however, the traditional stand-alone computing environment has difficulty with real-time realization. Currently, the rapid development of cloud computing technology provides a powerful support for improving the efficiency of map generalization. However, compared with the stand-alone environment, the data decomposition and the real-time display of point generalization in the cloud platform imposes higher requirements on the point generalization constraints, which play an important role in point-generalized process control. Based on the computational characteristics of the cloud platform, this paper analyzes the changes in point generalization constraints. In addition, our work proposes the constraints of point generalization based on the cloud platform and its construction method, builds a prototype system based on the Hadoop cloud platform. Our prototype system is tested using typical experimental data. Its efficiency and the quality of its results is examined. The results show that the efficiency and quality of point selection can be significantly improved by controlling the point generalization process with the generalization constraints in the cloud computing environment proposed in this paper.

However, there are concerns about the quality and usability of such VGI. In this study, we demonstrate a complete process that comprises the collection, unification, classification and validation of a type of VGI—online point-of-interest (POI) data—and develop methods to utilize such POI data to estimate disaggregated land use (i.e., employment size by category) at a very high spatial resolution (census block level) using part of the Boston metropolitan area as an example. With recent advances in activity-based land use, transportation, and environment (LUTE) models, such disaggregated land use data become important to allow LUTE models to analyze and simulate a person’s choices of work location and activity destinations and to understand policy impacts on future cities. These data can also be used as alternatives to explore economic activities at the local level, especially as government-published census-based disaggregated employment data have become less available in the recent decade. Our new approach provides opportunities for cities to estimate land use at high resolution with low cost by utilizing VGI while ensuring its quality with a certain accuracy threshold.

Several studies address VGI quality from various perspectives like completeness, positional accuracy, consistency, etc. They mostly have consensus on the heterogeneity of data quality. The problem may be due to the lack of standard procedures for data collection and absence of quality control feedback for voluntary participants. In our research, we are concerned with data quality from the classification perspective. Particularly in VGI-mapping projects, the limited expertise of participants and the non-strict definition of geographic features lead to conceptual overlapping classes, where an entity could plausibly belong to multiple classes, e.g., lake or pond, park or garden, marsh or swamp, etc. Usually, quantitative and/or qualitative characteristics exist that distinguish between classes. Nevertheless, these characteristics might not be recognizable for non-expert participants. In previous work, we developed the rule-guided classification approach that guides participants to the most appropriate classes. As exemplification, we tackle the conceptual overlapping of some grass-related classes. For a given data set, our approach presents the most highly recommended classes for each entity. In this paper, we present the validation of our approach. We implement a web-based application called Grass&amp;Green that presents recommendations for crowdsourcing validation. The findings show the applicability of the proposed approach. In four months, the application attracted 212 participants from more than 35 countries who checked 2,865 entities. The results indicate that 89% of the contributions fully/partially agree with our recommendations.

Foody; Guillaume Touya; Tobias Kellenberger; Demetris Demetriou,"The perspective of European National Mapping Agencies (NMA) on the role of citizen sensing in map production was explored. The NMAs varied greatly in their engagement with the community generating volunteered geographic information (VGI) and in their future plans. From an assessment of NMA standard practices, it was evident that much VGI was acquired with a positional accuracy that, while less than that typically acquired by NMAs, actually exceeded the requirements of the nominal data capture scale used by most NMAs. Opportunities for VGI use in map revision and updating were evident, especially for agencies that use a continuous rather than cyclical updating policy.

The potential role of citizen sensing and so its current scale of use by NMAs is limited by a series of concerns, notably relating to issues of data quality, the nature and motivation of the contributors, legal issues, the sustainability of data source, and employment fears of NMA staff.

The chapter begins by discussing the types of geographical knowledge that can be constructed in GIS and the types of geographical thinking that can result from these. The discussion then considers critical responses to GIS and the ways in which geography knowledge can be constructed through it. In the light of recent changes to GIS and the development of a broader array of related geospatial technologies, there follows a discussion of new geospatial technologies and their implications for teachers and educators of using these to develop geographical thinking.

Thus, in the arena of urban planning, we are in need of approaches that are able to cope not only with urban complexity but also allow for participatory and collaborative processes to empower citizens. This to create democratic cities. Connected to the field of smart cities and citizens, we present in this paper, the prototype of an urban digital twin for the 30,000-people town of Herrenberg in Germany. Urban digital twins are sophisticated data models allowing for collaborative processes. The herein presented prototype comprises (1) a 3D model of the built environment, (2) a street network model using the theory and method of space syntax, (3) an urban mobility simulation, (4) a wind flow simulation, and (5) a number of empirical quantitative and qualitative data using volunteered geographic information (VGI). In addition, the urban digital twin was implemented in a visualization platform for virtual reality and was presented to the general public during diverse public participatory processes, as well as in the framework of the “Morgenstadt Werkstatt” (Tomorrow’s Cities Workshop). The results of a survey indicated that this method and technology could significantly aid in participatory and collaborative processes. Further understanding of how urban digital twins support urban planners, urban designers, and the general public as a collaboration and communication tool and for decision support allows us to be more intentional when creating smart cities and sustainable cities with the help of digital twins.

Mattoccia; C. Berardocco; Augusto Mazzoni,"Abstract. Indoor mapping is an essential process in several applications such as the visualization of space and its utilization, security and resource planning, emergency planning and location-based alerts and, last but not least, indoor navigation. In this work, a completely free and open-source (FOS) approach to map indoor environments, and to navigate through them, is presented. Our tests were carried out within Sapienza University of Rome public buildings; in detail, Letters and Philosophy faculty and Engineering faculty indoor environments were mapped. To reach this goal, only open source software such as Quantum GIS (QGIS) and open-source platforms like Open Street Map (OSM) and its indoor viewer, Open Level Up (OLU) were adopted. A database of indoor environments of the two faculties, completely compatible with OLU, was created through QGIS. In this way, a public territorial information system of classrooms, offices and laboratories is accessible to everyone who can, hence, add or modify the information, following the principle of crowdsourcing and of Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI). The developed procedure is now standard and its outputs accepted by the OSM community. Hence, the long-term developments of this project are the proposal for the volunteered and cooperative indoor mapping and design of strategic buildings and infrastructures (hospitals, schools, public offices, shopping centers, stations, airports etc.), starting from the available information (indoor layouts) and knowledge acquired through experience of people who normally work inside them and/or visit them frequently. In this context it is possible to state that the development of VGI for internal maps for strategic buildings, infrastructures and denied GNSS environments, not only supports and improves internal and external navigation without interruption, but can also have a significant positive impact on security and emergency management.",XLIII-B4-2020,,361,365,World Wide Web; GNSS applications; Information system; Resource planning; Open street map; Visualization; Computer science; Volunteered geographic information; Crowdsourcing; Emergency management,,10.5194/isprs-archives-xliii-b4-2020-361-2020,3081097812

As this paper discusses, one reason this has not occurred is because understanding this relationship requires both quantitative and qualitative knowledge, including geospatial locations and patterns as well as why people choose to move the way they do. Few studies employ mixed methods to this end; instead, many quantitative approaches focus on the use of big data and many qualitative approaches remain focused on sites themselves rather than the movements between them. This methodological gap can preclude operationalising findings and proves particularly detrimental when research is conducted into areas with high levels of poverty and inequality. In response, this paper presents a mixed-methods approach to studying urbanisation, using volunteered geographic information (VGI) to map regional-scale movements in the Gauteng City-Region (GCR). Exploiting the potential of smartphone technology, this methodology operates at the interstice of quantitative and qualitative research, describing both macro-scale mobility patterns and the micro-scale decisions behind them. Using the case study of the GCR, it highlights movement as a strategy for those living in poverty, who can utilise the entire region as a resource to subvert entrenched inequality. ‘Thinking through people’ suggests that a new ontology of categories describing urbanisation processes in terms of movement could connect empirical research into poverty and inequality to theory, and be used to create an epistemology of the urban from below. Thus, this paper contributes to advances in urban studies methods as well as to debates on urbanisation, relational poverty and socio-spatial inequality. </jats:p>",,,004209802098225,,Geography; Economic geography; Urban studies; Urbanization; Volunteered geographic information,,10.1177/0042098020982251,3124766483

However, newly available data sources promise extended possibilities for the investigation and understanding of the underlying factors. We validate the rationale for using both opportunistically available crowd-sourced data (i.e., volunteered geographic information or VGI) as well as more established but rarely investigated authoritative data as predictors of subjective cycling risk. We achieve this by correlating indicators of cycling risk extracted from both VGI and authoritative data for two different German cities with participants’ risk estimates assessed in laboratory-based virtual reality experiments. In Case 1, 15 participants (mostly undergraduate students with a mean age of 22 years old; nine of them females) were tested as a sample representing frequent and experienced cyclists, but unfamiliar with the 19 tested locations and less likely to be affected by the virtual reality setup. In Case 2, 24 new participants (mostly undergraduate students; mean age 24 years; 13 of them females) were experienced cyclists and mostly familiar with the 40 test locations located in their city of residence. For both cases, our findings provide evidence that parameters extracted from VGI (e.g., the semantic severity of the contribution and the reception by other citizens) as well as from authoritative data sources (e.g., accident statistics or Space Syntax measures) represent valid indicators for the subjectively perceived risk of cycling at a specific location. On the basis of this validation, future research can use these data sources to investigate the sources of risk perception during urban cycling in greater detail.",121,,109,117,German; Psychology; Risk perception; Perception; Residence; Space syntax; Subjective risk; Cycling; Volunteered geographic information; Applied psychology,Accident statistics; Risk perception; Space syntax; Urban cycling; Volunteered geographic information,10.1016/j.aap.2018.09.009,2891231479

Individual citizens can themselves map and record land tenure rights. This paper explores if and how VGI and crowdsourcing may redefine the state based cadastres and land registries, and the roles of land users who claim land rights outside of the state based institutions. Using theories of institutions and isomorphism we hypothesise that a parallel exists between emerging open systems and situations where no state-based cadastre exists: participants in both situations will position themselves to protect their interests.

Hence, social sensing has become a powerful tool to uncover the actual land-use of a metropolis. However, current solutions for land-use discovery based on user-generated data usually rely on an information retrieval mechanism applied on a textual corpus. This causes ad-hoc place labelling with limited semantic meaning. In this line, the present work introduces a novel data-driven methodology that extends existing solutions by means of a classifier based on a pre-defined hierarchy of land categories. Two types of social networks –text-based and venue-based platforms– are utilized to train the classifier, which is then applied to infer the use of the land based on text data in areas where venue data are not available. The approach has been evaluated by using large datasets comprising two large cities, showing an accuracy above 90% in predicting the land-use categories.",140,,112892,,Classified information; Data science; Pace; Classifier (linguistics); Land based; Hierarchy; Computer science; Land use; Social network,,10.1016/j.eswa.2019.112892,2969784457

VGI is a source of crowdsourced geographic data and information which is comparable, and in some cases better, than equivalent data from National Mapping Agencies (NMAs) and Commercial Surveying Companies (CSC). However, there are many differences in how NMAs and CSC collect, analyse, manage and distribute geographic information to that of VGI projects. NMAs and CSC make use of robust and standardised data collection protocols whilst VGI projects often provide guidelines rather than rigorous data collection specifications. The proposed protocol addresses formalising the collection and creation of vector data in VGI projects in three principal ways: by manual vectorisation; field survey; and reuse of existing data sources. This protocol is intended to be generic rather than being linked to any specific VGI project. We believe that this is the first protocol for VGI vector data collection that has been formally described in the literature.

OpenStreetMap (OSM), the leading VGI project, aims at building an open-content world map through user contributions. OSM semantics consists of a set of properties (called 'tags') describing geographic classes, whose usage is defined by project contributors on a dedicated Wiki website. Because of its simple and open semantic structure, the OSM approach often results in noisy and ambiguous data, limiting its usability for analysis in information retrieval, recommender systems and data mining. Devising a mechanism for computing the semantic similarity of the OSM geographic classes can help alleviate this semantic gap. The contribution of this paper is twofold. It consists of (1) the development of the OSM Semantic Network by means of a web crawler tailored to the OSM Wiki website; this semantic network can be used to compute semantic similarity through co-citation measures, providing a novel semantic tool for OSM and GIS communities; (2) a study of the cognitive plausibility (i.e. the ability to replicate human judgement) of co-citation algorithms when applied to the computation of semantic similarity of geographic concepts.

Sui,"Being the world’s most populous country with growing geographic and social disparities, child begging and missing children has been reported in some Chinese cities and has become a major social issue with growing national attention. The booming of Internet use in general and location-based social media in particular have equipped Chinese citizens with the tools needed to voluntarily engage in several recent rescue efforts toward child beggars, as well as to help the missing children find their way back home. Although academic research on child beggars and missing children has gained increasing attentions in some parts of the world, limited number of studies have addressed the geographic patterns of these two unique population in China. In this article, we provided an overview of child beggars and missing children issue in China, based on the observations from two Chinese social media platforms. Using a representative sample of volunteered geographic information crawled from Sina Weibo and Baby Back Home, this paper examined the geographic distribution of child beggars and missing children in China respectively, and explored how social media platform via Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) has empowered citizens to help rescue child beggars and missing children find their way back home. Our results showed that VGI can serve as a powerful data source for studying the complexity and diversity of child beggars and missing children issues in Chinese cities.

Social media tools are integrated in most parts of our daily lives, as citizens, netizens, researchers or emergency responders. Lessons learnt from disasters and emergencies that occurred globally in the last few years have shown that social media tools may serve as an integral and significant component of crisis response. Communication is one of the fundamental tools of emergency management. It becomes crucial when there are dozens of agencies and organizations responding to a disaster. Regardless of the type of emergency, whether a terrorist attack, a hurricane or an earthquake, communication lines may be overloaded and cellular networks overwhelmed as too many people attempt to use them to access information. Social scientists have presented that post-disaster active public participation was largely altruistic, including activities such as search and rescue, first aid treatment, victim evacuation, and on-line help. Social media provides opportunities for engaging citizens in the emergency management by both disseminating information to the public and accessing information from them.

Two spatial data quality elements, thematic accuracy and completeness are addressed by comparing the OSM data with an authoritative German reference dataset. The results show that the kappa value indicates a substantial agreement between the OSM and the authoritative dataset. Nonetheless, for our study region, there are clear variations between the LULC classes. Forest covers a large area and shows both a high OSM completeness (97.6%) and correctness (95.1%). In contrast, farmland also covers a large area, but for this class OSM shows a low completeness value (45.9%) due to unmapped areas.

In order to support these tasks effectively and efficiently, landmark pictograms also need to be salient, as the map user needs to identify and process them quickly and easily. Two additional relevant characteristics for the usability of landmark pictograms are their meaningfulness and recognition performance. Meaningfulness is required to understand which categories of objects are represented by the pictograms. Ease of recognition prevents the necessity to consult a map repetitively and may support the formation of a cognitive map of the environment. In the present study, we investigated the relation between salience, meaningfulness and recognition performance of OpenStreetMap (OSM) pictograms and the potential effects of the visual complexity of pictograms on these usability characteristics. Salience was measured via eye fixations on specific pictograms, meaningfulness with an explicit continuous scale and recognition performance with a yes/no recognition memory paradigm. Statistical analyses showed that pictograms drew more visual attention if they were visually complex or if their meaning was inapprehensible or ambiguous. Less apprehensible pictograms were also recognized more often. Interestingly, the data indicated that longer fixations could lead to worse recognition performance. Long fixations on a pictogram may increase the likelihood of false recognition in subsequent situations where the pictogram is no longer valid or relevant. Based on the findings, we suggest balancing the meaningfulness and visual complexity of contiguous pictograms to enhance their recognition and to provide an optimal level of salience of single objects.",75,,214,220,Artificial intelligence; Fixation (psychology); Usability; Cognitive map; Salience (language); Natural language processing; Spatial cognition; Landmark; Computer science; Pictogram; Recognition memory,Cartosemiotics; Cognitive cartography; Empirical cartography; Landmarks; Meaningfulness; Memory; Pictograms; Recognition; Salience; Spatial cognition; Volunteered geographic information,10.1016/j.apergo.2018.10.008,2899979558

To demonstrate our approach, we use as a case study in Manhattan (New York) that compares networks constructed from three different geo-textural data sources—TripAdvisor attraction reviews, TripAdvisor restaurant reviews, and Twitter data. The results showcase how the thematic similarity network approach enables us to conduct clustering analysis as well as node-to-node and node-to-cluster analysis, which is fruitful for understanding how places are connected through individuals’ experiences. Furthermore, by enriching the networks with geodemographic information as node attributes, we discovered that some low-income communities in Manhattan have distinctive restaurant cultures.

This research develops a conceptual framework as the foundation to conduct a cross-case comparison for four empirical cases in recreation and invasive species monitoring, but general enough for other such case comparisons. The VGI Reporting Assessment Framework (VGI-RAF) adopted aspects of the Decision Situation Assessment (DSA) framework as the foundation to address institutional flexibility, stakeholder dynamics, and technical considerations. Using a cross-case comparison can accumulate deep observations from cases and increase validity of insights through comparing processes. Results show that eight aspects of the VGI-RAF reveal the suitability of embedding voluntary information within existing institutional decision-making processes. VGI-RAF depicts considerations for: (1) existing participation arrangements, (2) institutional arrangements, (3) managers’ needs and stakeholder expectation, and (4) interaction mechanism and technical needs. The cross-comparison results indicate that a public participation mechanism should be accompanied by VGI development to increase effectiveness. Institutional arrangements should match local government's information needs with participants’ expectations.

The participation and engagement of grass-root level community groups and citizens for natural resource management has a long history. With recent developments in ICT tools and spatial technology, these groups are seeking a new opportunity to manage natural resource data. There are lot of spatial information collected/generated by landcare groups, land holders and other community groups at the grass-root level through their volunteer initiatives. State government organisations are also interested in gaining access to this spatial data/information and engaging these groups to collect spatial information under their mapping programs. The aim of this paper is to explore the possible utilisation of volunteered geographic information (VGI) for catchment management activities. This research paper discusses the importance of spatial information and spatial data infrastructure (SDI) for catchment management and the emergence of VGI. A conceptual framework has been developed to illustrate how these emerging spatial information applications and various community volunteer activities can contribute to a more inclusive spatial data infrastructure (SDI) development at local level. A survey of 56 regional NRM bodies in Australia was utilised to explore the current community-driven volunteer initiatives for NRM activities and the potential of utilisation of VGI initiatives for NRM decision making process.

In particular, the production of high-quality integrated data from multiple sources requires an understanding of their respective characteristics and a systematic assessment of the consistency within and between the data sources. In order to perform the assessment, the data has to be placed on a common ground. However, in practice, heterogeneous geodata are often provided in diverse formats and organized in significantly different structures. In this work, we propose a framework that uses an ontology-based approach to overcome the heterogeneity by means of a domain ontology, so that consistency rules can be evaluated at the unified ontological representation of the data sources. In our case study, we use open governmental data from Open Data Portals (ODPs) and volunteered geographic information from OpenStreetMap (OSM) as two test data sources in the area of the province of South Tyrol, Italy.

Stehman; Cidália Costa Fonte; Giles M. Foody; Linda See,"Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) offers a potentially inexpensive source of reference data for estimating area and assessing map accuracy in the context of remote-sensing based land-cover monitoring. The quality of observations from VGI and the typical lack of an underlying probability sampling design raise concerns regarding use of VGI in widely-applied design-based statistical inference. This article focuses on the fundamental issue of sampling design used to acquire VGI. Design-based inference requires the sample data to be obtained via a probability sampling design. Options for incorporating VGI within design-based inference include: 1) directing volunteers to obtain data for locations selected by a probability sampling design; 2) treating VGI data as a “certainty stratum” and augmenting the VGI with data obtained from a probability sample; and 3) using VGI to create an auxiliary variable that is then used in a model-assisted estimator to reduce the standard error of an estimate produced from a probability sample. The latter two options can be implemented using VGI data that were obtained from a non-probability sampling design, but require additional sample data to be acquired via a probability sampling design. If the only data available are VGI obtained from a non-probability sample, properties of design-based inference that are ensured by probability sampling must be replaced by assumptions that may be difficult to verify. For example, pseudo-estimation weights can be constructed that mimic weights used in stratified sampling estimators. However, accuracy and area estimates produced using these pseudo-weights still require the VGI data to be representative of the full population, a property known as “external validity”. Because design-based inference requires a probability sampling design, directing volunteers to locations specified by a probability sampling design is the most straightforward option for use of VGI in design-based inference. Combining VGI from a non-probability sample with data from a probability sample using the certainty stratum approach or the model-assisted approach are viable alternatives that meet the conditions required for design-based inference and use the VGI data to advantage to reduce standard errors.",212,,47,59,Data mining; Statistical inference; Estimator; Inference; Population; Computer science; Stratified sampling; Volunteered geographic information; Remote sensing; Sampling design; Sampling (statistics),,10.1016/j.rse.2018.04.014,2802971269

These data can supplement traditional data sources, such as road maps hosted by governmental offices. Libya’s governmental maps of urban infrastructure are scarce and incomplete. This provides an incentive for citizens and grassroots groups to collect and generate spatial data on their own and to express changed realities of feature names by the means of crowd-sourced mapping. Using two districts in Libya this study evaluates for five Web 2.0 platforms (OpenStreetMap, Wikimapia, Google Map Maker, Panoramio, and Flickr) to which extent VGI reflects name changes of geographical features as a result of the revolution in 2011. Other data sources, such as school directories posted by teachers on Facebook, serve as additional information for feature name change detection. Results show that the extent to which VGI reflects name changes based on the 2011 revolution in Libya varies strongly between VGI data sources. VGI provides a useful supplement to limited governmental resources to better understand how names of artificial geographical features are affected by changes in political systems.",83,2,237,255,Engineering; Web 2.0; Regional science; Geopolitics; Local community; Data sharing; Grassroots; Public relations; Volunteered geographic information; Human geography; Politics,,10.1007/s10708-016-9764-5,2576955511

The relationship between man and the environment is bidirectional one that have great short-term and long-term impacts on the cities and regions. The best way to deal with it is the participation of the people themselves. The use of new technologies has now become one of the most important methods for monitoring the environment that can increase the participation of citizens, improving environmental problems to provide the cheapest and the most accessible form. Developing countries such as Iran, which faces enormous environmental problems are suitable for the development of technological methods of monitoring. Large population and citizens’ participation feasibility using VGI can have a positive effect on developing countries.

This article presents an effort to validate and further improve a previously published innovative approach for drawing macroseismic intensity maps from data extracted from sources of volunteered geographic information (VGI). Our approach involves classification of macroseismic observations (extracted from social media sources) to values of the EMS 98 intensity scale, leading to the drawing of isoseismal maps. The earthquake of June 12th, 2017 (Mw 6.3) that occurred off the south coast of Lesvos Island, Greece, was used as a case study; its main shock was located at depth of about 13 km. This specific event, which claimed the life of a woman and caused at least 15 injuries due to collapsing buildings and falling debris (mainly in the town of Vrissa), was chosen for the specific geomorphological characteristics of the meizoseismal area, time of occurrence and distribution of damage. Twitter was chosen as a VGI source mostly for reasons of consistency with the original published work, generating comparable findings that can be assessed more readily to facilitate further development of the methodology. Results of the dataset analysis include the drawing of the isoseismal maps from Tweets published within different time periods (6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h); and the identification of various text patterns regarding the evaluation of the macroseismic observations that result into intensity values. The present work offers additional empirical evidence regarding the validity of the methodology presented in the scientific literature, and further enriches it by providing additional text patterns and specific improvements related to the classification of the information in certain values of seismic intensity. Assessment of the results is enriched by the progress that has been noted in the field and has been presented in the international scientific literature since 2016.",XLII-3/W4,,59,66,Empirical evidence; Geography; Scientific literature; Social media; Volunteered geographic information; Cartography,,10.5194/isprs-archives-xlii-3-w4-59-2018,2809140873

Based on these findings policies steering the shape of cities have been proposed to reduce urban transport emissions and limit congestion. Such policies can also be relevant for the rapidly growing and motorising Chinese cities. Yet, empirical evidence on the relationships between urban form and car usage is scarce for the specific Chinese context that is characterised by high densities, fast development and strong government steering. Using novel crowd-sourced datasets we study the impact of several urban form variables (city size, urban density, land-use mix, polycentricity and spatial clustering) on the cost of commuting expressed in time and distance. The results show that city size and spatial clustering are important determinants of commuting: large cities without clear clusters of businesses and other facilities have longer average commuting times and distances. Increased prosperity also adds to longer and lengthier commutes. Spatial planning measures that maintain or reinforce high-density clusters can help limiting commuting distance and time. Current sprawled urban development may have long-term, negative consequences for the accessibility and liveability of Chinese cities and could hamper their economic potential.",45,5,1269,1295,Government; Empirical evidence; Geography; Economic geography; Prosperity; Spatial planning; Polycentricity; Urban form; Urban density; Urban planning; Economic growth,,10.1007/s11116-017-9762-6,2589486517

VGI data is often provided only as vector data represented by lines and not as full extent.

In this work, we use the prior information provided by the VGI and extract the full road extent even if there is significant mis-registration between the VGI and the image. The method consists of image segmentation and traversal of multiple agents along available VGI information. First, we perform image segmentation, and then we traverse through the fragmented road segments using autonomous agents to obtain a complete road map in a semi-automatic way once the seed-points are defined. The road center-line in the VGI guides the process and allows us to discover and extract the full extent of the road network based on the image data. The results demonstrate the validity and good performance of the proposed method for road extraction that reflects the actual road width despite the presence of disturbances such as shadows, cars and trees which shows the efficiency of the fusion of the VGI and satellite images.</jats:p>",ahead-of-print,ahead-of-print,,,Image segmentation; Tree traversal; Artificial intelligence; Pixel; Traverse; Road map; Geolocation; Computer vision; Computer science; Volunteered geographic information; Segmentation,,10.1016/j.aci.2018.07.004,2884732374

Volunteered geographical information (VGI) is an increasing source of data for many applications. In order to explore some of these sources of data, an algorithm was conceived and implemented in the ExploringVGI platform enabling the collection of georeferenced data from collaborative projects that provide an Application Programming Interface (API). This paper presents a preliminary study to evaluate the consistency and relevance of VGI extracted from Flickr platform for emergency mitigation and municipal management. The study carried out was based on data extraction and analysis with keywords related to emergency events (“Accident”, “Flood” and “Fire apartment”), and municipal management (“Graffiti” and “Homeless”) in four European cities (Frankfurt, Lisbon, London, and Rome). The proposed approach sets up a region of interest on a map, selects one or more keywords for the search, and carries out a search using the Flickr API. Data detected and extracted were then loaded into a database and further analysed to verify whether they were consistently obtained through consecutive searches at different locations. A statistical analysis performed on data collected for each case provided us with: the total number of data collected for each keyword and location; their relevance in terms of search goal; and the quality of the associate geolocation of the post.

This article reviews the foundation of geocoding and presents a framework for evaluating geocoding quality. Errors introduced by street gecoding include incompleteness, positional error, and incorrect assignment to geographic units. A review of empirical studies suggests that these errors are neither small nor random in nature and that substantial bias may be introduced in spatial analysis that employs the results of geocoding. Several alternatives have also emerged, including the use of address points and parcels, and these are gradually becoming more widely used. Several areas for future research on geocoding have been identified: (i) refinements of address data models to incorporate complex addressing situations; (ii) development of error propagation techniques to determine the level of geocoding quality required for a particular analysis scenario; (iii) development of measures of reliability for geocoding results; (iv) comparative analysis of geocoding quality across different jurisdictions; and (v) validation of online geocoding services and volunteered geographic information.",3,2,647,680,Empirical research; Propagation of uncertainty; Data mining; Geography; Data science; Geocoding; Volunteered geographic information; Data modeling,,10.1111/j.1749-8198.2008.00205.x,2097562313

L. Liang; Alexander Zipf; Jamal Jokar Arsanjani,"Abstract: The increasing availability of sensor devices has resulted in important volumes of sensor data, which has raised the issue of making these data fully discoverable and interpretable by applications and end-users. The idea of OGC Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) has addressed this issue by proposing a set of standards to enable accessibility of sensor data over the Web. Similarly, there is a growing interest in volunteered geographic information (VGI). Considering that several researchers have highlighted the potential of this new type of information as a complement to existing, “traditional” data, it becomes important to develop frameworks to support the integration of VGI from several sources and with other types of data. In this paper, we make a first step in this direction by proposing a framework for the semantic interoperability of sensor data and VGI. After having performed an investigation of the types of VGI applications, we have developed a conceptual model of VGI aligned with relevant ISO standards for describing geospatial features. The purpose of this model is to support the generation of common descriptions for VGI applications, which will act as interfaces to higher-level services, such as discovery and reasoning services, in order to be exploited in conjunction with sensor data by client applications. This process is described through architecture for semantic interoperability of sensor data and VGI that we have developed and that we intend to use to set guidelines for future research on integration of VGI in sensor data cyberinfrastructures.

In this paper we investigated the impact of PV on land use in the area with the highest density of PV farms in Italy, i.e. the Province of Lecce (Southeastern Italy): here, such impact is expected to be maximum and has been the subject of public debate. In order to map all PV farms in detail, we used participative cartography, specifically OpenStreetMap (OSM), as data source. This international project collects geographic information (often gathered by people – i.e. the so-called Volunteered Geographic Information , VGI – using widely available technologies, such as smartphone built-in GPS), in order to create freely available global topographic maps. In this paper, we used the OSM platform to create a Geographical Information System (GIS) of PV farms in the Province of Lecce. Using GIS-based techniques, we estimated land use at the municipality level and created a density map of PV farms within the study area. Using the official land cover map Corine Land Cover of 2012, we also evaluated the main changes in land use. The results highlight the correlation between spatial distribution of PV farms and geographic variables (geomorphology, demographics, tourism, etc).

Mark,"Landscape scenery is inherently difficult to conceptualize because of its perceptual nature. Yet landscapes are an extremely important resource for tourism and quality of life so there is a need to classify and manage landscapes. This paper shows how viewshed analysis based on the known location and direction of a photo can be used to tag a photo and this provides a method for assessing the New Zealand Landscape Classification. GIS visibility and overlay functions are combined with digital elevation data and a landscape classification to produce the tagged photos. This tool links an oblique view with multiple distance perspectives to a GIS dataset. There are complexities associated with distance perspectives and the appropriate balance of foreground and distant landscape. This paper argues that the benefits of automated tagging of landscape photos are threefold. The process of modelling landscape tags forces researchers to confront the complexity of landscape character classification. This in turn leads to improved methods for representing and classifying landscape character. Secondly, once tagging methods have been developed then people may choose to use these tools rather than to manually tag photos. Thirdly, such a tool provides the opportunity to utilize the increasingly important volunteered geographic information on the Internet for understanding landscape categories. Landscape photographs and associated tags on the Internet provide insight about landscape categories employed by the public. This could lead to the development of what is labelled “tag clouds” and a landscape “folksonomy”",31,3,1115,1122,The Internet; Visibility; Tourism; Geography; Viewshed analysis; Data science; Tag cloud; Folksonomy; Elevation data; Volunteered geographic information; Cartography,,10.1016/j.apgeog.2011.03.003,1987795672

This VGI may be of huge value for institutions, individuals and decision-makers, but only if it can be discovered, evaluated for quality and fitness-for-purpose and combined with data from other sources. If VGI data are to be discovered, used and reused to their full potential, they must be actively managed. In this chapter we assess the current state of the art regarding data management practices in VGI, identify some challenges, obstacles and best-practice examples, and review a range of developing and established open source technologies which can underpin robust and sustainable data management for VGI. We conclude that VGI is likely to remain patchy and heterogeneous and that existing standards may not be exploited to their full potential. Nevertheless, automated support for documenting the generation and use of VGI, as well as annotations following the Linked Data paradigm, can help to improve interoperability and reuse. We were able to identify good practices within different existing systems, but more research and development work is needed in order to support their joint application for the benefit of VGI.

The authors developed a web based pilot application for disaster management, with special emphasis on inland excess water hazard management. Free and open source software was used to generate a model, and our work was based on Web GIS standards (OGC), which makes further development possible. The developed Web GIS application provides functions to support the data collection regarding channels and ditches, and on-line hydrological analysis based on OGC Web Processing Services (WPS). Hydrological analysis aims to visualize the areas potentially at risk, depending on different precipitation quantities and various values of influencing factors. In order to run the prototype a sample data set was gathered including reference maps, technical parameters and current condition of canals and ditches. The methodology of crowdsourcing can produce valuable Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) that can fulfill the data requirements of disaster management applications. The prototype supports Crowdsourcing in the following aspects: free user access to the system’s analysis functionality, stakeholders may digitize the position of ditches, modify the status of the existing ditch system according to current conditions and add or modify parameters relevant for the analysis. The application demonstrated the usability of stakeholder generated geographic information and web processing for disaster management.

Among them, the OpenStreetMap project (OSM) has been very successful in collecting/offering volunteered geographic information (VGI). Very different behaviours are observed among OSM participants, which translate into large differences of lifespan, contribution levels (e.g. Nielsen’s 90–9-1 rule) and attitudes towards innovations (e.g. Diffusion of innovation theory or DoIT). So far, the literature has defined phases in the life cycle of contributors only based on the nature of their contributions (e.g. role of participants and edits characteristics). Our study identifies the different phases of their life cycle from a temporal perspective and assesses how these phases relate to the volume and the frequency of the contributions from participants.

Technologies play an important role in making this connection, and one frequent way that cities connect with citizens is through 311-style request systems. 311 is a non-emergency municipal notification system that uses telephone, email, web forms, and increasingly, mobile applications to allow citizens to notify government of infrastructure issues and make requests for municipal services. In many ways, this process of citizen contribution mirrors the provision of volunteered geographic information, that is spatially-referenced user generated content. This research presents a case study of the city of Edmonton, Canada, an early adopter of multi-channel 311 service request systems, including telephone, email, web form, and mobile app 311 request channels. Three methods of analysis are used to characterize and compare these different channels over three years of request data; a comparison of relative request share for each channel, a spatial hot spot analysis, and regression models to compare channel usage with sociodemographic variables. The results of this study indicate a shift in channel usage from traditional to Internet-enabled, that this shift is mirrored in the hotspots of request activity, and that specific digital inequalities exist that reinforce this distinction between traditional and Internet-enabled reporting channels.",1,2,18,31,User-generated content; Early adopter; Engineering; World Wide Web; Government; Communication channel; Digital divide; Municipal services; Notification system; Volunteered geographic information; Telecommunications,,10.17645/up.v1i2.621,2417732261

VGIS, implemented by executing a project and its crowdsourcing strategy, are driven by online networked community participation enabled by a technological infrastructure. However, without community engagement, crowdsourcing, the core process of a VGIS, fails to create value and its main advantage becomes one of its biggest challenges. To address this problem, we present a conceptual framework to assist in designing engagement strategies to motivate and facilitate goal-oriented participation. To this end, we examine the relation between Maslow’s human needs and VGI, its different goals, and current studies on motivation. We analyze intrinsic and internalized motivation, focusing on the needs outlined in self-determination theory. Finally, we apply Vroom’s expectancy theory of motivation in relation to VGI. As a result, the proposed framework consists of three design tools: core drivers, participant types to whom efforts to motivate should be aligned with the project rationale, and an engagement process consisting of three main actions: Enroll, Grow and Retain. With this framework, future VGIS developments can have a structured approach that guides participation and the design of engagement strategies.",21,1,5,41,Conceptual framework; Sociology; Urban economics; Fundamental human needs; Expectancy theory; Maslow's hierarchy of needs; Community engagement; Knowledge management; Volunteered geographic information; Crowdsourcing,,10.1007/s10109-018-00289-5,2906930825

The abundance of mobile phones and other wireless forms of communication open up significant opportunities for the public to get involved in scientific research. As these devices and activities become more abundant, questions of uncertainty and error in volunteer data are emerging as critical components for using volunteer-sourced spatial data. Here we present a methodology for using VGI and assessing its sensitivity to three types of error. More specifically, this study evaluates the reliability of data from volunteers based on their historical patterns. The specific context is a case study in surveillance of tsetse flies, a health concern for being the primary vector of African Trypanosomiasis. Reliability, as measured by a reputation score, determines the threshold for accepting the volunteered data for inclusion in a tsetse presence/absence model. Higher reputation scores are successful in identifying areas of higher modeled tsetse prevalence. A dynamic threshold is needed but the quality of VGI will improve as more data are collected and the errors in identifying reliable participants will decrease. This system allows for two-way communication between researchers and the public, and a way to evaluate the reliability of VGI. Boosting the public’s ability to participate in such work can improve disease surveillance and promote citizen science. In the absence of active surveillance, VGI can provide valuable spatial information given that the data are reliable.",16,1,1,11,Data mining; Health informatics; Spatial analysis; Citizen science; Health geography; Data science; Disease surveillance; Computer science; Geographic information system; Reputation; Volunteered geographic information,,10.1186/s12942-017-0113-9,2767688083

This system will be used by government agencies to monitor municipal activities like road laying and planning. The system utilizes a database created by geo-citizens or government workers as an input. The heavy machinery in existing systems is not an optimized solution to this problem. Some existing systems use GPS and accelerometer data for determining such artifacts. So, it is evident that there is a need for a system that generates robust, frequent and accountable geo-tagged data. We propose a new collaborative model for such a purpose by fusion of data from multiple sensors hosted on smart-phones of several active geo-citizens. The system focuses mainly on volunteered geographic information, in which users can use their respective smart-phones to collect the data required and upload it for further analysis. The server side of the system infuses this data into a PostGIS database and displays the road condition on a near real-time basis over a WebGIS. The strength of a good visualization in imparting insight to decision-makers is widely recognized. We advance the paper by assessing procured road data and displaying it in an easy to understand format. In addition to visualization, the WebGIS component also provides for timeline analysis of changes in road conditions, which may help in the improved management of road infrastructure.",V-4-2020,,33,38,Server-side; Data analysis; Collaborative model; Visualization; Computer science; Timeline; Volunteered geographic information; Global Positioning System; Upload; Database,,10.5194/isprs-annals-v-4-2020-33-2020,3047198839

Gombert,"<jats:p>Land use and land cover (LULC) mapping is often undertaken by national mapping agencies, where these LULC products are used for different types of monitoring and reporting applications. Updating of LULC databases is often done on a multi-year cycle due to the high costs involved, so changes are only detected when mapping exercises are repeated. Consequently, the information on LULC can quickly become outdated and hence may be incorrect in some areas. In the current era of big data and Earth observation, change detection algorithms can be used to identify changes in urban areas, which can then be used to automatically update LULC databases on a more continuous basis. However, the change detection algorithm must be validated before the changes can be committed to authoritative databases such as those produced by national mapping agencies. This paper outlines a change detection algorithm for identifying construction sites, which represent ongoing changes in LU, developed in the framework of the LandSense project. We then use volunteered geographic information (VGI) captured through the use of mapathons from a range of different groups of contributors to validate these changes. In total, 105 contributors were involved in the mapathons, producing a total of 2778 observations. The 105 contributors were grouped according to six different user-profiles and were analyzed to understand the impact of the experience of the users on the accuracy assessment. Overall, the results show that the change detection algorithm is able to identify changes in residential land use to an adequate level of accuracy (85%) but changes in infrastructure and industrial sites had lower accuracies (57% and 75 %, respectively), requiring further improvements. In terms of user profiles, the experts in LULC from local authorities, researchers in LULC at the French national mapping agency (IGN), and first-year students with a basic knowledge of geographic information systems had the highest overall accuracies (86.2%, 93.2%, and 85.2%, respectively). Differences in how the users approach the task also emerged, e.g., local authorities used knowledge and context to try to identify types of change while those with no knowledge of LULC (i.e., normal citizens) were quicker to choose ‘Unknown’ when the visual interpretation of a class was more difficult.</jats:p>",12,7,1186,,Change detection; Data science; Land cover; Urban land; Earth observation; Computer science; Geographic information system; Land use; Volunteered geographic information; Big data,,10.3390/rs12071186,3016014728

These changes necessitate considerable modifications of the energy infrastructure. Even though most of these modifications are inherently motivated by geospatial questions and challenges, the integration of energy system models and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) is still in its infancy.

The participants appeared to make judgements based on what information they saw, rather than what they were told about the source of the information.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""PRACTITIONER SUMMARY"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">Since 2004, information services have combined crowdsourced (volunteered) alongside professional information within online interactive maps.

We review current and emerging technologies that are changing the way we study and record the natural world. From websites to smartphones, data capture is becoming easier, faster and more accessible. Increases in data volume and wider participation raises concerns over data quality, which are being addressed with accurate sensors, automated validation tools, and verification platforms that utilize expert taxonomists and collective intelligence to ensure the highest level of quality possible. Data curation and interoperability have been transformed in the information age. The need to collate data at continental and global scales and across institutions continues to drive the formation of standardized data formats and taxonomies. Once collated these data can be analysed using high-performance computing, and used to provide valuable feedback in the form of interactive visualizations, computer-generated text or even game-like rewards. We also address issues arising from these technological developments. For example: how will the role of the expert naturalist change?

Ostermann; Rob Lemmens,"The emergence of volunteered geographic information (VGI) during the past decade has fueled a wide range of research and applications. The assessment of VGI quality and fitness-of-use is still a challenge because of the non-standardized and crowdsourced data collection process, as well as the unknown skill and motivation of the contributors. However, the frequent approach of assessing VGI quality against external data sources using ISO quality standard measures is problematic because of a frequent lack of available external (reference) data, and because for certain types of features, VGI might be more up-to-date than the reference data. Therefore, a VGI-intrinsic measure of quality is highly desirable. This study proposes such an intrinsic measure of quality by developing the concept of aggregated expertise based on the characteristics of a feature's contributors. The article further operationalizes this concept and examines its feasibility through a case study using OpenStreetMap (OSM).

Purves,"<jats:p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract.&lt;/strong&gt; Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) in the form of actively and passively generated spatial content offers extensive potential for a wide range of applications. Realising this potential however requires methods which take account of the specific properties of such data, for example its heterogeneity, quality, subjectivity, spatial resolution and temporal relevance. The creation and production of such content through social media platforms is an expressive aspect of human behaviour, and as such influenced strongly by the co-occurrence of events and context external to the social media. In this project we are developing geovisual analysis methods which show how actors interact in location based social media (LBSM), and how their interactions influence, and are influenced by, their physical and social environment and relations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first phase of the project, we developed and demonstrated a conceptual model enabling the extraction, analysis and visualisation of events and reactions to events in LBSM. A central element of this model and its implementation is the integration of spatial, temporal, thematic and social dimensions, or &lt;i&gt;facets&lt;/i&gt;, combined with an explicit link between events and reactions. We have developed a conceptual model of collective reactions in LBSM [1] which includes a task matrix underpinning our methodological efforts. A key output of this conceptual model, and the resulting task matrix was the acknowledgement of the importance of exploring multiple dimensions in LBSM reactions to events, namely the spatial, temporal, thematic and social which relate to where, when, what and who questions which can be posed of such data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conceptual model formed a basis for our research on bridging the gap between visually-driven analysis and visual communication, or story telling [2]. Findings and results of the analysis often need to be communicated to an audience that lacks expertise in visualization and analysis methods. This requires analysis outcomes to be presented in simpler ways than that are typically used in analysis supporting systems. Not only analytical visualizations may be too complex for target audiences but also the information that needs to be presented. Analysis results may consist of multiple components, which may involve multiple heterogeneous facets. Hence, there exists a gap on the path from obtaining analysis findings to communicating them, within which two main challenges lie: information complexity and display complexity. We address this problem by proposing a general framework for story synthesis, in which the analyst creates and organises story contents from analysis results. Story synthesis includes selecting and assembling findings and arranging them in meaningful layouts that take into account the structure of information and inherent properties of its components (facets). Paper [2] proposes a facet-based generic framework for story synthesis which can be applied to different kinds of VGI and LBSM data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To introduce our concepts, we use an example based on the IEEE VAST Challenge 2011 [3], requiring analysis of the circumstances of an epidemic outbreak in a fictive city Vastopolis. The data are geographically referenced microblog messages, some of which include keywords indicating disease symptoms, such as fever, chills, sweats, aches and pains, coughing, etc. The time span of the data is 3 weeks. An analyst needs to find out when and where the outbreak started and how it developed. The analyst uses a visual analytics system providing multiple types of interactive visual displays and supporting database queries and data transformations. Fig.1 shows how analysis artefacts are managed. In the course of the analysis, the analyst has obtained a set of findings (labelled F1-F5), which include the outbreak start time, the spatial clusters and the times of their existence, the differing sets of frequent keywords associated with the clusters, the location and time of the truck crash, and the ways of spreading and temporal development of two diseases. As the next natural step, these findings need to be communicated to any interested audience, but not as disjoint information pieces but as an integrated story. The pieces need to be arranged in appropriate ways revealing the relationships between the information pieces, such as temporal and spatial relationships. Figures 1C and 1D show examples of arrangements that might be created by the VAST Challenge analyst for conveying temporal and spatial relationships between the findings. Another kind of relationship the analyst may wish to reflect is the differences between the symptoms of two diseases that were discovered in the course of the analysis. For this purpose, the analyst may juxtapose the lists of the keywords corresponding to the central-eastern and south-western clusters. Analysts should be able to create and edit such arrangements in order to construct understandable and interesting stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A process of story synthesis includes the following activities: aggregate and summarize (as a means of simplification and achieving a desired level of detail), embed details (enable drilling down into aggregates), arrange (put information pieces in a meaningful layout), show facets (exhibit information structure), and annotate (include explanations and comments). Information facets play an important role in story synthesis. They need to be presented to story recipients to enable proper understanding of information. However, heterogeneous facets, such as space, time, population, semantics of message texts (represented by keywords or topics), etc. may be hard to present simultaneously while keeping the display simple and easy to understand and avoiding information overload. Such facets may be represented in complementary views providing different perspectives on the information. The task matrix introduced in paper [1] suggests taking into account only two facets at once. Inherent properties of information facets can be used for meaningful arrangement of story slices and for aggregation. Thus, temporal and spatial arrangements, as in Fig.1 (C, D), exploit the inherent properties of time (temporal ordering and distances) and space (spatial distances, neighbourhood, and relative directions). Paper [2] describes an example of analysing expressions of people’s reactions to political events and processes, such as the Brexit, in LBSM and organizing analysis findings in stories with the use of various facet-based layouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the further work, we extend the research scope to studying reactions as a component of behaviour (along with human activities and emotions), incorporating external social and physical context to better allow events to be related and compared. This will not only include development of new analysis methods and workflows but also definition of new analysis tasks and, respectively, new types of analytical results. These extensions will require further work on finding, on the one hand, effective representations for analytical visualizations, on the other hand, expressive and easily understandable representations for communication of analysis findings. Besides, a general problem to be tackled is how to incorporate analyst’s input, such as background knowledge and context information that is not reflected in available data, in both analytical visualizations and stories presenting analysis results. It would be interesting to go beyond mere use of textual annotations towards representing such inputs in a visual form, which needs to be distinguishable from the representation of the data.&lt;/p&gt;;                     </jats:p>",1,,1,2,Conceptual model; Information overload; Data science; Information structure; Population; Central element; Multiple time dimensions; Computer science; Volunteered geographic information; Visual analytics,,10.5194/ica-abs-1-10-2019,2959129322

Consequently, we proposed a method utilizing the volunteered geographic information data to extract the road from satellite images. At first, from Mapbox platform, the Volunteered Geographic Information data, OpenStreetMap vector tiles are collected to guide the downloading of corresponding road satellite images. Then a level set method is used to extract the road areas from the satellite images supported by the road vector. After that, a superpixel method is applied to improve the road areas by fusing the superpixels with the previous results. Experiments are performed on the satellite images from Mapbox, Google, and Yahoo in the Tianjin Port district on accuracy and efficiency.

Volunteered geographic information (VGI) and social media have the potential to provide this needed missing information. This paper presents initial work carried out in identifying the potential of crowdsourced geographic information in defence. We first provide a short description of the role of UK defence and review the existing literature on crowdsourced geographic information in defence, as well as generic VGI quality assessment methods. We then explore the potential of crowdsourced data in real-world applications: the conflation of VGI and social media with official data for effective decision-making in war zones, and the potential for crowdsourcing to increase effective collaboration between machines and humans in disaster situations. Based on our review, we outline specific research challenges for deploying crowdsourced geographic information in defence, focussing on data quality and fitness-for-purpose assessment.

As highlighted in several chapters of this book, highresolution remotely sensed data serve day-to-day applications. Virtual Globes such as Google Earth have brought such images to everybody’s fingertips. Lesser known to the wider public are two other fields of data generation: real-time in situ sensing of environmental parameters and sensing of human behavior in space and time. Environmental data are mainly sensor-generated. Examples include weather stations or intelligent mobile sensor pods. We call these “machine-generated” data. On the contrary, direct measurements of humans in space and time are predominantly restricted for privacy reasons. Information about persons or groups and their behavior in space and time is either derived from so-called volunteered geographic information (VGI) or it may be derived from proxy data, for example, from mobile communication networks or social media. In this chapter, we argue that multiple coordinated views of spatiotemporal data provide unprecedented opportunities for geographic analysis in times of “big data.” Together, these different types of data generation enable an integrated sensing.

Private individuals voluntarily collect large amount of geographic data for a joint project. This data are usually free under certain licence restrictions. ; One of the most well known examples of VGI is the OpenStreetMap (OSM) project. Due to its increasing popularity it has developed in less than 10 years to a useful data source. Private, scientific and commercial users are wondering how good is these voluntarily collected data and can it be an alternative to expensive authority and commercial datasets. ; This study presents a quality assessment of the OSM road network against a reference dataset from Lantmateriet (Swedish National Mapping Agency). In order to allow a meaningful evaluation, corresponding features in both datasets have to be identified. This process is commonly referred as matching. Difficulties of automatic matching occur due to the different geometric representations of the two datasets.; An automated matching algorithm is developed to match road network data from OpenStreetMap and Lantmateriet. The method is adopted from Koukoletsos et al. (2012) and developed further to incorporate feature correspondence. The matching is based mainly on geometric and attribute (road name) constraints. Besides minor pre-processing steps the algorithm works completely automated and can be applied to any region with data coverage in Sweden.; The matching is performed in a case study covering the area of Goteborg, the second largest city Sweden. The created feature correspondence is then used to calculate the quality elements completeness, positional accuracy and thematic accuracy. ; The matching algorithm returned good results with an acceptable matching error. The quality assessment revealed that OSM can be seen as a proper data source which has some reservation regarding the attribute accuracy.",,,,,Data mining; Geography; Reservation; Data source; Quality assessment; Completeness (statistics); Volunteered geographic information; Cartography; Blossom algorithm; Thematic map; Geospatial analysis,,,1796898603

We propose a data-driven model to address these issues on OpenStreetMap (OSM), a particular case of VGI in recent times. This research examines the hypothesis of evaluating the proficiency of the contributor to assess the credibility of the data contributed. The proposed framework consists of two phases, namely, an exploratory data analysis phase and a learning phase. The former explores OSM data history to perform feature selection, resulting in “OSM Metadata” summarized using principal component analysis. The latter combines unsupervised and supervised learning through K-means for user-clustering and multi-class logistic regression for user classification. We identified five major classes representing user-proficiency levels based on contribution behavior in this study. We tested the framework with India OSM data history, where 17% of users are key contributors, and 27% are unexperienced local users.

Sophisticated flood simulation in urban areas is a challenging task due to the difficulties in data acquisition and model verification. This study incorporates three rapid-growing technologies, i.e. volunteered geographic information (VGI), unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and computational flood simulation (CFS) to reconstruct the flash flood event occurred in 14 June 2015, GongGuan, Taipei. The high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) generated by a UAV and the real-time VGI photos acquired from social network are served to establish and validate the CFS model, respectively. The DEM data are resampled based on two grid sizes to evaluate the influence of terrain resolution on flood simulations. The results show that flood scenario can be more accurately modelled as DEM resolution increases with better agreement between simulation and observation in terms of flood occurrence time and water depth. The incorporation of UAV and VGI lower the barrier of sophisticated CFS and shows great potential in flood impact and loss assessment in urban areas.",,,1,22,Flash flood; Terrain; Data acquisition; Digital elevation model; Occurrence time; Two grid; Environmental science; Volunteered geographic information; Cartography; Flood myth,,10.5194/hess-2020-59,3010290526

In addition, collecting statistics on typhoon disaster situations is hard work for the government. At the same time, near-real-time disaster-related information can be obtained on developed social media platforms like Twitter and Weibo. Many cases have proved that citizens are able to organize themselves promptly on the spot, and begin to share disaster information when a disaster strikes, producing massive VGI (volunteered geographic information) about the disaster situation, which could be valuable for disaster response if this VGI could be exploited efficiently and properly. However, this social media information has features such as large quantity, high noise, and unofficial modes of expression that make it difficult to obtain useful information. In order to solve this problem, we first designed a new classification system based on the characteristics of social medial data like Sina Weibo data, and made a microblogging dataset of typhoon damage with according category labels. Secondly, we used this social medial dataset to train the deep learning model, and constructed a typhoon disaster mining model based on a deep learning network, which could automatically extract information about the disaster situation. The model is different from the general classification system in that it automatically selected microblogs related to disasters from a large number of microblog data, and further subdivided them into different types of disasters to facilitate subsequent emergency response and loss estimation. The advantages of the model included a wide application range, high reliability, strong pertinence and fast speed. The research results of this thesis provide a new approach to typhoon disaster assessment in the southeastern coastal areas of China, and provide the necessary information for the authoritative information acquisition channel.</jats:p>",7,9,318,,Deep learning; Microblogging; Government; Artificial intelligence; Communication channel; Typhoon; Data science; Disaster assessment; Computer science; Social media; Volunteered geographic information,,10.3390/jmse7090318,2973107877

Particularly in natural resource management, Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) is increasingly recognized as a significant resource, for example, supporting visitation pattern analysis to evaluate collective values and improve natural well-being. In recent years, however, user privacy has become an increasingly important consideration. Potential conflicts often emerge from the fact that VGI can be re-used in contexts not originally considered by volunteers. Addressing these privacy conflicts is particularly problematic in natural resource management, where visualizations are often explorative, with multifaceted and sometimes initially unknown sets of analysis outcomes. In this paper, we present an integrated and component-based approach to privacy-aware visualization of VGI, specifically suited for application to natural resource management. As a key component, HyperLogLog (HLL)—a data abstraction format—is used to allow estimation of results, instead of more accurate measurements. While HLL alone cannot preserve privacy, it can be combined with existing approaches to improve privacy while, at the same time, maintaining some flexibility of analysis. Together, these components make it possible to gradually reduce privacy risks for volunteers at various steps of the analytical process. A specific use case demonstration is provided, based on a global, publicly-available dataset that contains 100 million photos shared by 581,099 users under Creative Commons licenses.

A range of applications has been proposed using OSM data, including routing and navigation, crisis mapping, 3D modelling, land use/cover mapping. This is because the OSM data is not only free of use, but also has a global coverage and high currentness. In despite of the above advantages, however, most of the OSM data were contributed by ‘non-professional’ or ‘amateur geographers’ (Goodchild 2008; Haklay 2010). Therefore, a lot of concerns have been paid attention to the quality issue of the OSM data. Assessing the quality of OSM data has become a hot topic in the field of geographic information science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extensive studies have been carried out on assessing various quality measures (e.g. positional accuracy, completeness and attribute accuracy) of OSM datasets in different countries or districts such as Germany, England, France, Italy, Canada and the United States. In the meanwhile, the road feature of an OSM dataset has been paid much attention to. To our knowledge, however, not any study has been focused on assessing the data quality of OSM building data in China, although it may be an essential data source for urban planning and management, 3D modelling and indoor navigation. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the OSM building data in China. More precisely, an analysis of the spatial-temporal evolution and completeness of OSM building data in China from 2012 to 2017 was carried out. The tenet of our study was to employ two quality indicators, i.e. building count (Gröchenig et al. 2013, Barron et al. 2014, Fan 2016) and building density (Zhou 2018), for the analyses. First, the numbers of OSM building data from 2012 to 2017 were calculated in terms of both provincial- and prefecture-level divisions in China; The OSM building count were then compared among different divisions and also different years (2012&amp;amp;ndash;2017) for analyzing the evolution of OSM building data in China in both temporal dimension and spatial scale. Moreover, the correlations between OSM building counts and four potential factors (i.e. gross domestic product (GDP), population, urban land area, OSM road length), which may influence the development of OSM building data in China, were respectively investigated. Second, a 1&amp;amp;thinsp;&amp;amp;times;&amp;amp;thinsp;1&amp;amp;thinsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; regular grid was overlapped onto the OSM building datasets in urban areas for calculating the OSM building density of each grid cell; Moreover, high-density grid cells (whose OSM building data were almost complete) were extracted and analyzed through a simple clustering method, in order to investigate the spatial pattern of OSM building data in urban areas. Results showed that,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) The OSM building data in China increased almost 20 times from the years 2012 to 2017, especially for those located in the eastern coastal regions of China (e.g. the provincial-level divisions: Jinagsu, Zhejiang, Guangzhou and Shandong and the prefecture-level divisions: Beijing, Nantong, Shanghai, Tianjin, Suzhou, Yangzhou and Dalian). In most cases, both the GDP and OSM road length factors had a moderate correlation with the OSM building count.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 2) Most of the grid cells in urban areas still had no building or their building densities were equal to 0%, which indicated that the OSM building dataset in China was far from being complete. From analyzing the high density grid cells, two typical spatial distribution modes, i.e. dispersion and aggregation, were found in different prefecture-level divisions. As an example, the high-density grid cells for some prefecture-level divisions (e.g. Luoyang, Yueyang and Dalian) were mostly aggregated in the city cores; while those for some (e.g. Beijing Tianjin and Shanghai) were located in the hot spots such as business districts, attractions and transportation hubs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The above results may benefit for users (especially those researchers and educators) to choose appropriate study area(s) from the OSM building dataset in China. In the meanwhile, the volunteers around the world may be motivated to contribute more OSM building data in this region. Further research work may include: developing quality indicators for quantitative completeness estimation of OSM building data, especially in rural areas; and investigating other quality measures (e.g. positional accuracy and semantic accuracy) or geographical features (e.g. railways, land uses, and points of interest) in China’s OSM dataset.&lt;/p&gt;;                     </jats:p>",1,,436,2,Geography; Data quality; Beijing; Population; Geographic information system; Land use; Urban planning; Volunteered geographic information; Cartography; Cluster analysis,,10.5194/ica-abs-1-436-2019,2963956301

Since the 1990s, the consolidation of technological platforms for geographic information has expanded the possibilities of geospatial analysis in conjunction with GIS. Even ordinary people have become capable of interactive web communication with electronic maps thanks to the emergence of smartphones compatible with GeoAPI (application programming interface) and Wi-Fi access. Many studies have described the progress that built a solid foundation of web democracy by embodying people-powered mapping circumstances in the so-called Web 2.0. However, we have yet to acquire geographic information ethics that sufficiently respond to new threats stemming from these circumstances. In the present paper, the author instantiated a user-generated online mapping website named Caveat Emptor (a.k.a. Oshimaland) to investigate the necessity of a geographic information ethics 2.0. By incorporating Suler’s (2004) concept of online disinhibition effects, the author clarified that people can utilise new technologies both in good ways and bad, from behind the safety of a mask. Despite the omnoptic mutual surveillance environment, the associated participants in actual scenes of cyberspace are not always restrained. This explains why it is necessary to update geographic information ethics to be compatible with Web 2.0 circumstances. Four types of ethical challenges were identified that are concerned with (1) the extent to which volunteered geographic information (VGI) should be recruited in constructing collective knowledge, (2) how to build a renewed geographic information ethics in general, (3) how to construct a gradation in geographic information ethics in practice, and (4) what scientific knowledge should be referred to in the contiguous areas of specialisation.",2,,1,8,Caveat emptor; Emerging technologies; Data science; Cyberspace; Participatory GIS; Computer science; Volunteered geographic information; Collective intelligence; Information ethics; Geospatial analysis,,10.5194/ica-proc-2-126-2019,2961525572

This study reviews the contribution of some of these trends to Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) development, particularly in Africa. A geospatial application based on Google Container Engine, an Infrastructure as a Service cloud, has been developed. Data was sourced from the 2015 Kenya Certificate of Primary Education, the Kenya school mapping project of 2007 from the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, and Kenya's administrative boundary layers from the Independent and Electoral Boundaries Commission. By using the cloud, several operations and analyses typically common in SDIs were carried out. In addition, a cost estimate of a cloud-based Kenya National Spatial Data Infrastructure deployment is presented. Although the new technologies may not necessarily lead to wider SDI adoption, the study shows that the trends can increase the chances of SDI development and adoption, by permitting highly scalable geoservices, and facilitating cost-effective free and open source software.",6,4,189,204,Software deployment; Business; Spatial data infrastructure; Emerging technologies; Data science; Volunteered geographic information; Linked data; Big data; Cloud computing; Geospatial analysis,,10.13189/cea.2018.060402,2889552000

Such an approach has significant advantages but requires access to relatively detailed spatial data. In the absence of official data concerning resources, researchers may benefit from employing increasingly available volunteered geographic information (VGI) as a central source of data or to complement more traditional data sources. This paper describes the development of a map of forest recreational resources in Ireland by combining conventional forest cover data and VGI of recreational trails. As an extension the new map is combined with household survey data to explore respondent's ability to identify local recreational forests and models the impact of the characteristics of the closest forest on their annual visitation. The results suggest that VGI can be a useful resource to researchers in both the identification and characterisation of recreational resources. In addition, this paper finds that the distance to and characteristics of the nearest recreational forest has a significant impact on total annual visitation by members of the public.",60,,69,76,Environmental resource management; Recreation; Spatial analysis; Natural resource management; Valuation (finance); Geography; Respondent; Forest cover; Volunteered geographic information; Information needs,,10.1016/j.apgeog.2015.03.007,2010119112

In this paper, OSM road data have been analyzed with the aim of characterizing the behavior of OSM contributors. The study area, Ankara, the capital city of Turkey, was evaluated with several network analysis methods, such as completeness, degree of centrality, betweenness, closeness, PageRank, and a proposed method measuring the activation of contributors in a bounded area from 2007–2017. An evaluation of the results was also discussed in this paper by taking into account the following indicators for each year: number of nodes, ways, contributors, mean lengths, and sinuosity values of roads.

By containing ‘definitive’ lists of places, gazetteers have the ontological power to define what will and will not be geocoded and represented in databases, maps, search engines, and ultimately our spatial understandings of place. This paper focuses attention on GeoNames, which is the world's largest freely available and widely used gazetteer. We illustrate how content in GeoNames is characterised by highly uneven spatial distributions. There are dense clusters of place-names in some parts of the world and a relative absence of geographic content in others. These patterns are related not just to the wealth and population size of a country, but also to its policies on Internet access and open data. The paper then traces some of the specific implications of this information inequality: showing how biases in gazetteers are propagated in a variety of geographic meaning-making.Peer-reviewedPost-prin",47,6,1254,1264,Population size; Poverty; Geography; Data science; Ontology; Lists of places; Open data; Information inequality; Geocoding; Internet access,,10.1177/0308518x15594899,3121277314

Remote sensing techniques have eased land use/cover mapping substantially by observing the earth remotely through diminishing field surveying and in-site data collection. However, field measurement is still required to identify training sites for defining the existing land use classes, which requires visiting the study area. This paper is intended to utilize volunteered geographic information (VGI) contributions to the OpenStreetMap (OSM) project as an alternative data source instead of gathering training sites through insite visits and to evaluate how accurate land use patterns can be mapped. High resolution imagery of RapidEye with 5 meter spatial resolution is selected to derive land use patterns of Koblenz, Germany through a maximum likelihood classification technique. The achieved land use map is compared with the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security Urban Atlas (GMESUA) and a Kappa Index of 89% is achieved.

However, delineating the spatial extent of all RRRs regulated in legislation remains a challenge. Approaches that have been used so far are mainly based on accurate surveying processes, which are untimely and too expensive. Previous studies proposed Volunteered Geographical Information (VGI) as a practical and low-cost method for fast acquisition of spatial data from volunteered contributions, mostly for countries where a limited number of land rights records exist. However, VGI could be beneficial for advanced and developing land administration systems in terms of collecting a range of RRRs which are not spatially well recorded and represented. A multidisciplinary review of the literature on VGI and land administration reveals the lack of a comprehensive conceptual framework for utilising VGI in land administration for the purpose of collecting a range of RRRs related to land and property. This paper investigates the main aspects of utilising VGI in land administration based on qualitative content analysis of available resources. The outcome of this research suggests that using VGI in land administration requires a comprehensive understanding of the complexities and interconnections of legal, institutional, technical and social aspects within each jurisdiction.

We show that ATP binding by SecA causes opening of the SecY-channel at long range, while substrates at the SecY-channel entrance feed back to regulate nucleotide exchange by SecA. This two-way communication suggests a new, unifying 'Brownian ratchet' mechanism, whereby ATP binding and hydrolysis bias the direction of polypeptide diffusion.

Next, a tool is developed in order to design the central crowdsourced processing unit that is best suited for a specific project definition, associating it with a trend towards crowd-based or community-driven approaches. The design is structured around the characterization of different ways of participating, and the task cognitive demand of working on geo-information management, spatial problem solving and ideation, or knowledge acquisition. Then, the crowdsourcing process design helps to identify what kind of participants are needed and outline subsequent engagement strategies. This is based on an analysis of differences among volunteers? participatory behaviors and the associated set of factors motivating them to contribute, whether on a crowd or community-sourced basis.

The challenges of how to ensure sustainable urban development are currently one of the important agenda among governments around the world. The stakeholders require the latest and high volume of geographic information for the decision making process to efficiently respond to challenges, improve service delivery to citizens, and plan a successful future of the city. However, it is time-consuming and costly to get the available information and some of the information is not up-to-date. Recently, GeoWeb 2.0 technological advances have increased the number of volunteers from non-professional citizen to contribute to the collection, sharing, and distribution of geographic information. The information known as Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) has generated another approach of spatial data sources that can give up-to-date, huge volume of data, and available geographic information in a low cost for various applications. With this in mind, this paper presents a review of literature based on the potential use of Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) in measuring sustainability of urban development.

VGI quality is represented by indicators at distinct levels of granularity which take into account the distinct components of the VGI items. The quality indicators represent both the extrinsic quality, depending on the characteristics and reputation of the sources of information; the intrinsic quality, depending on the distinct accuracy and precision of information; and, last but not least, the pragmatic quality, depending on the user needs and intended purposes. In order to assess the pragmatic quality of VGI items, a linguistic decision making approach is defined that allows users to rank and finally filter the VGI items based on the satisfaction of distinct criteria expressed by means of both linguistic terms, defining soft constraints on the distinct quality indicators, and linguistic aggregators, defining fuzzy operators which combine the satisfaction degrees of the soft constraints at distinct hierarchical levels to yield the final satisfaction of the VGI items.

However, the data-scarce environment of SSA limits our understanding of the urban dynamics in the region. In this context, Earth Observation (EO) is an opportunity to gather accurate and up-to-date spatial information on urban extents. During the last decade, the adoption of open-access policies by major EO programs (CBERS, Landsat, Sentinel) has allowed the production of several global high resolution (10–30 m) maps of human settlements. However, mapping accuracies in SSA are usually lower, limited by the lack of reference datasets to support the training and the validation of the classification models. Here we propose a mapping approach based on multi-sensor satellite imagery (Landsat, Sentinel-1, Envisat, ERS) and volunteered geographic information (OpenStreetMap) to solve the challenges of urban remote sensing in SSA. The proposed mapping approach is assessed in 17 case studies for an average F1-score of 0.93, and applied in 45 urban areas of SSA to produce a dataset of urban expansion from 1995 to 2015. Across the case studies, built-up areas averaged a compound annual growth rate of 5.5% between 1995 and 2015. The comparison with local population dynamics reveals the heterogeneity of urban dynamics in SSA. Overall, population densities in built-up areas are decreasing. However, the impact of population growth on urban expansion differs depending on the size of the urban area and its income class.</jats:p>",13,3,525,,Geography; Urban expansion; Sub saharan; Socioeconomics,,10.3390/rs13030525,3127055881

Kaack; Marius Zumwald; François Andrieux; Daniel de Barros Soares; Steffen Lohrey; Peter-Paul Pichler; Felix Creutzig,"Understanding cities as complex systems, sustainable urban planning depends on reliable high-resolution data, for example of the building stock to upscale region-wide retrofit policies. For some cities and regions, these data exist in detailed 3D models based on real-world measurements. However, they are still expensive to build and maintain, a significant challenge, especially for small and medium-sized cities that are home to the majority of the European population. New methods are needed to estimate relevant building stock characteristics reliably and cost-effectively. Here, we present a machine learning based method for predicting building heights, which is based only on open-access geospatial data on urban form, such as building footprints and street networks. The method allows to predict building heights for regions where no dedicated 3D models exist currently. We train our model using building data from four European countries (France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Germany) and find that the morphology of the urban fabric surrounding a given building is highly predictive of the height of the building. A test on the German state of Brandenburg shows that our model predicts building heights with an average error well below the typical floor height (about 2.5 m), without having access to training data from Germany. Furthermore, we show that even a small amount of local height data obtained by citizens substantially improves the prediction accuracy. Our results illustrate the possibility of predicting missing data on urban infrastructure; they also underline the value of open government data and volunteered geographic information for scientific applications, such as contextual but scalable strategies to mitigate climate change.",15,12,e0242010,,Climate change; Transport engineering; Open government; Underline; Computer science; Scalability; Urban planning; Volunteered geographic information; Missing data; Geospatial analysis,,10.1371/journal.pone.0242010,3111868370

Within the construction sector, Building Information Models (BIMs) are more and more used thanks to the several benefits that they offer in the design of new buildings and the management of the existing ones. Frequently, however, BIMs are not available for already built constructions, but, at the same time, the range camera technology provides nowadays a cheap, intuitive and effective tool for automatically collecting the 3D geometry of indoor environments. It is thus essential to find new strategies, able to perform the first step of the scan to BIM process, by extracting the geometrical information contained in the 3D models that are so easily collected through the range cameras. In this work, a new algorithm to extract planimetries from the 3D models of rooms acquired by means of a range camera is therefore presented. The algorithm was tested on two rooms, characterized by different shapes and dimensions, whose 3D models were captured with the Occipital Structure SensorTM. The preliminary results are promising: the developed algorithm is able to model effectively the 2D shape of the investigated rooms, with an accuracy level comprised in the range of 5 - 10 cm. It can be potentially used by non-expert users in the first step of the BIM generation, when the building geometry is reconstructed, for collecting crowdsourced indoor information in the frame of BIMs Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) generation.",42,,75,81,Data mining; Engineering; Artificial intelligence; Information model; 3d geometry; 3d model; Computer vision; Volunteered geographic information; Crowdsourcing; Building information modeling,,,2770929609

Geographical information science is no exception. In this article, we investigate the possibilities for deployment of e-infrastructures to inform spatial planning, analysis and policy-making. We describe an existing architecture that feeds both static and dynamic simulation models from a variety of sources, including not only administrative datasets but also attitudes and behaviours which are harvested online from crowds. This infrastructure also supports visualisation and computationally intensive processing. The main aim of this article is to illustrate how spatial simulation models can be calibrated with crowd-sourced data. We introduce an example in which popular attitudes to congestion charging in a major UK city (Manchester) were collected, with promotional support from a high-profile media organisation (the BBC). These data are used to estimate the parameters of a transport simulation model, using a hungry estimation procedure which is deployed within a high-performance computational grid. We indicate how the resulting model might be used to evaluate the impact of alternative policy options for regulating the traffic in Manchester.

A particular category of satellite observations—Earth Observations (EO)—is concerned with capturing information regarding the Earth’s atmospheric and environmental conditions and observing human activity and its impact on the Earth’s surface. A growing number of technologies and services heavily rely on EO data and the rapidly improving fidelity, coverage, timeliness and accessibility of such observations are providing significant opportunities for new applications of economic and societal benefit. With the increasing importance, relevance and size of EO data sets, it is critical to understand how the value of such data can be maximised by complementing EO with other sources of data and efficiently making complex interpretations and decisions. The wide adoption and availability of smartphones, Internet devices and increased accessibility to information has paved the way for large numbers of citizens and communities to participate in scientific, technological, societal and decision-making activities. This chapter discusses the experience of the European Space Agency funded Crowd4Sat project led by the University of Sheffield that investigated different facets of how crowdsourcing and citizen science impact upon the validation, use and enhancement of Observations from Satellites products and services.",,,35,52,The Internet; Satellite; Citizen science; Geography; Data science; Fidelity; Operations research; Crowdsourcing; Scientific method,,10.1007/978-3-319-70878-2_2,2749210020

Millera,"Abstract It is increasingly clear that many of the existing transportation systems in the world are inefficient, inequitable and unsustainable. In many places, we have evolved a rigid transportation monoculture that forces people to adapt to the system rather than a flexible, responsive and user-friendly transportation polyculture that can adapt more easily to people and their activities. However, creating a flexible and responsive transportation system will require more coordination and cooperation across a variety of spatial scales and time horizons than is evident in our current, competitive systems. This lecture will discuss the role of collaboration in developing the next generation of transportation systems, and the role of geographic information science in facilitating cooperation across space and time for strategic, tactical and operational decision-making in transportation.",21,,24,28,Environmental economics; Monoculture; Game theory; Transport engineering; Computer science; Geographic information system; Advanced Traffic Management System,,10.1016/j.sbspro.2011.07.005,1997401965

Immediate responses by corporations and governments were geared toward building knowledge so that accurate and efficient programs could be devised toward curbing the impacts of the pandemic on society. However, one aspect to this was noted as to the limited availability of data sharing across platforms, systems, and jurisdictions, leading to limited datasets, hence, rendering inaccurate predictions that can be used to contain and limit the virus outbreak. In view of required immediate actions, volunteered geographic information (VGI) and citizen science concept have emerged, where people voluntarily share location and health status data to circumvent data sharing restrictions imposed upon corporations and governments. This is leading to more accurate predictions and supporting an emergence of alternative tools. This chapter explores this dimension and outlines how people, previously aggressively resisting data sharing, do so willingly in times of emergencies.",,,81,88,Internet privacy; Business; Citizen science; Turnover; Data sharing; Urban health; 2019-20 coronavirus outbreak; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Volunteered geographic information; Pandemic,,10.1016/b978-0-12-824313-8.00005-x,3044888957

In this study, we evaluate the completeness of the road network in the VGI data set OpenStreetMap (OSM). The evaluation is based on an accurate and efficient network-matching algorithm. The study begins with a comparison of the two main strategies for network matching: segment-based and node-based matching. The comparison shows that the result quality is comparable for the two strategies, but the node-based result is considerably more computationally efficient. Therefore, we improve the accuracy of node-based algorithm by handling topological relationships and detecting patterns of complicated network components.

The assumption that VGI is inferior to PGI is shown to be unfounded; rather each has its own strengths in describing particular aspects of the user information landscape. Considering the opportunities to influence user activities, both VGI and PGI have a greater ability to influence the user in the planning phase than actually during the activity.

Wilson,"The general convergence of location with digital information communication technologies (ICTs) has brought about profound shifts in the content, forms, and practices that surround spatial media. In geography, these phenomena have been variously and alternately referred to as ‘volunteered geographic information’ (VGI) (Elwood et al. 2011; Goodchild 2007), ‘neogeography’ (Graham 2010; Turner 2006; Warf and Sui 2010; Wilson and Graham 2013a, 2013b), ‘(new) spatial media’ (Crampton 2009; Elwood and Leszczynski 2012), and ‘the geoweb,’ (Elwood and Leszczynski 2011; Haklay et al. 2008; Scharl and Tochtermann 2007). Here, we prefigure ‘the geoweb’ as we consider it to account for both new materialities and new practices. Regardless of the neologism used to refer to these phenomena, they nevertheless present significant challenges to our disciplinary thinking about geographic information and technologies. Much of our early engagements of the geoweb have been informed by the GIScience and Critical GIS traditions, which are ontologically and epistemologically committed to data regimes, practices, and technics associated with geographic information systems (GIS) as a singular or unique technological assemblage (for examples see Farman 2010; Guptill 2007; Miller 2006; Sui and Goodchild 2011; Sui 2008; Wilson 2009). More recently, however, geographers have acknowledged that the rapid proliferation and diversification of spatial media, content forms, and praxes require new empirical, conceptual, and theoretical approaches to apprehend both the nature and implications of these transitions and materialities. This need for new approaches has been most saliently articulated in a 2008 special issue of GeoJournal devoted to VGI edited by Sarah Elwood (volume 72 issues 3–4) (Elwood 2008b). Contributors to this special issue highlighted the imperatives of reconceptualizing entrenched notions of ‘the user’ (Budhathoki et al. 2008); attending to the altered contexts of information curation (Flanagin and Metzger 2008); evaluating the effectiveness and appropriateness of existing frameworks—such as Feminist, Critical, and Participatory GIS—for ‘reading’ or engaging the geoweb (Elwood 2008a; Tulloch 2008); and, devising new metrics and/ or schemes for evaluating the validity and reliability of user-generated geographic information (Bishr and Mantelas 2008; Mummidi and Krumm 2008).

The system enables users to define to what extent they would like the route to have green areas (e.g., parks, squares, trees), social places (e.g., cafes, restaurants, shops) and quieter streets (i.e., with less road traffic). We present how the greenness, sociability, and quietness factors are defined and extracted from OSM as well as how they are integrated into a routing cost function. We intrinsically evaluate customized routes from one-thousand trips, i.e., origin⁻destination pairs, and observe that these are, in general, as we intended-slightly longer but significantly more social, greener, and quieter than the respective shortest routes. Based on a survey taken by 156 individuals, we also evaluate the system's usefulness, usability, controlability, and transparency. The majority of the survey participants agree that the system is useful and easy to use and that it gives them the feeling of being in control regarding the extraction of routes in accordance with their greenness, sociability, and quietness preferences.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the process involved in conducting storm damage surveys, and to assess how information gathered during these surveys is used. Primary research for this study involved conducting semi-structured interviews with Environment Canada damage surveyors from various provinces (n=10) and wind engineering researchers from a large public university in Canada (n=2), as well as an onsite observation of a damage survey conducted in Angus, Ontario after a tornado struck on 17 June 2014. The results of this study underscored the subtle but important differences between storm damage surveys conducted in the United States and Canada. It was also found that the majority of damage surveys are now conducted remotely through photos, videos, and telephone interviews with key witnesses. Finally, damage surveys were found to be a critical component of the disaster management cycle by contributing to both risk reduction and preparedness.

Furthermore, in some contexts where authoritative datasets is not available, VGI may be the only source of GI. Although, VGI possess numerous advantages, it unfortunately faces several challenges. One of the clear challenges that face VGI is the quality. VGI quality is inherently heterogeneous and VGI lacks quality assurance. Due to its different nature, VGI does not comply with standard quality assurance procedures that are applied to spatial data. Thus, assuring VGI quality becomes increasingly important. Various previously proposed studies are concerned with VGI quality assurance. This paper conducts a literature review on previously proposed VGI quality assurance mechanisms.

121-168-873-746-845,Tracing Mental Models in Cartographic Datasets – The Case of OpenStreetMap,2020-10-08,2020,journal article,Abstracts of the ICA,25702106,Copernicus GmbH,,Franz-Benjamin Mocnik,"Abstract. Geographical features can be represented in different ways. Buildings, for instance, can be represented as areal features defined by polygonal lines or as point features in a map. While the type of representation chosen to represent a building strongly depends on the scale of the map, it seems common to represent points of interests (POIs) as point features. More complex examples exist. For example, the way buildings that are part of a mosque are conceptualized and thus labelled in a map strongly depends on how familiar we are with the Arabic culture. The same applies to the often perceived separation between public and private space in Arabic cultures, which can have an impact on geometrical aspects of map representations. Such coexisting representations of geographical features can, in particular, be observed in collaboratively created data sources (Mocnik et al., 2019), such as OpenStreetMap (OSM) data and maps generated from these. Competing representations of geographical features can reduce the readability of a map, but they can also open up opportunities to draw conclusions about the underlaying mental model (Mayer et al., 2020). When the people involved in the map creation process have different mental representations of a geographical feature, the representations they create often differ. This, in turn, impacts the readability, which refers to the process of transferring a map representation into a mental one, i.e., the process opposed to map creation, as there is often no clear and unambiguous correspondence between the symbols in the map and the represented geographical features (Scheider et al., 2009; Mocnik et al., 2018) Over time, these conceptualizations can mutually influence and lead to a convergence (Mocnik et al., 2017). Despite this, the coexistence of different cartographic representations makes possible to draw conclusions about the way a feature has been conceptualized. The symbols in the map encode, accordingly, besides the intended information about the geographical features, also information about the mental models involved (Mayer et al., 2020). The effect of mental models on the map representation often goes unnoticed because there is, in many cases, only very subtle variation between the map representations of one type of geographical features. If such variation would be much larger, it would even be impossible to interpret the symbols of a map. While the examples discussed above can be traced very well in individual cases, it is yet unclear how systematic the influence of mental models is. A systematic examination of such examples can investigate the influence statistically and at a larger scale. Further research might show the extent to which conclusions can practically be drawn about the conceptualization of geographical features and corresponding mental representations. The ability to trace mental models through maps is a suitable tool for exploring the conceptualization of geographies. For instance, future research might investigate in detail the impact culture has on the way we conceptualize. Likewise, it might investigate how people experience urban landscapes in different ways. By using maps and the data behind them as a source of information for mental models, maps gain a new purpose while the original one is put into the background. While such thinking is common for sketch maps, it also also applies, to a lesser degree, to Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI), which can become a valuable data source for ethnologists, human geographers, psychologists, and cognitive scientists. In a similar way, a better understanding of how mental models relate to cartographic representations can help to improve the latter. The cartographic representation of idiosyncratically experienced geographies, for instance, still poses challenges. Also, stories are, in many cases, hard to convey through classical maps (Mocnik and Fairbairn, 2018). The same applies to places and corresponding cartographic representations, which often are characterized by subjective and idiosyncratic aspects (Westerholt et al., 2018; Westerholt et al., 2020). The empirical investigation of the effect mental models have on cartographic representations can be expected to also provide insights into the reverse process, thus leading to cartographic techniques that make it possible to convey idiosyncratic experience and, eventually, also emotions.",2,,1,2,Tracing; Cognition; Readability; Geographical feature; Sketch; Computer science; Volunteered geographic information; Cartography; Conceptualization; Mental representation,,10.5194/ica-abs-2-5-2020,3092197710

We review the state of the scientific literature to understand the ways social media has been, and can be, used to measure visitation, spatial patterns of use, and visitors' experiences in parks and protected areas. Geotagged social media are a good proxy for actual visitation; however, the correlations observed by previous studies between social media and other sources of visitation data vary substantially. Most studies using social media to measure visitation aggregate data across many years, with very few testing the use of social media as a visitation proxy at smaller temporal scales. No studies have tested the use of social media to estimate visitation in near real-time. Studies have used geotags and GPS tracks to understand spatial patterns of where visitors travel within parks, and how that may relate to other variables (e.g., infrastructure), or differ by visitor type. Researchers have also found the text content, photograph content, and geotags from social media posts useful to understand aspects of visitors' experiences, such as behaviors, preferences, and sentiment. The most cited concern with using social media is that this data may not be representative of all park users.

In this article, our main goal is to present-conceptually and in praxis-a model that could be used from the emergency responders for timely and efficient emergency management and response in an urban complex environment. For the city of Cologne in Germany, we aim to indicate possible ways to decrease the emergency response time during an extreme flood scenario through the development of an accessibility indicator, which consists of different components. Therefore, we will investigate the opportunities that occur, in a flood risk scenario, from the use of geographic information in different forms such as Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) and open-source data in an ArcGIS environment, to increase urban resilience through the decreasing emergency response time. We will focus on network analysis for the fire brigades (first acting emergency responders) during a flood scenario to calculate their emergency response ranges and emergency response routes through flooded road networks, for the assistance of the possibly affected hospitals, refugee homes and fire brigades, which can be flooded. At the end of the paper, we suggest that the vulnerable community of the refugees could be taken into consideration as a new source of VGI, as an additional component that would lead to the decrease in the emergency response time. The geo-located information that could be provided by the refugee community can be very useful in emergency situations, such as those examined in this article where timely information can be forwarded to the proper authorities for a more focused and timely emergency response, increasing the resilience of the urban population and their community.",91,1,29,57,Psychological resilience; Geography; Transport engineering; Urban resilience; Population; Geographic information system; Civil defense; Volunteered geographic information; Emergency management; Flood myth; Environmental planning,,10.1007/s11069-017-3102-1,2767883755

We propose constructing an agent population directly from a CDR dataset and fusing it with link volume counts to reduce spatio-temporal uncertainty and correct for underrepresented traffic segments. The problem of finding a set of travel plans which realizes a set of CDR trajectories and is consistent with a set of link volume counts is rephrased in terms of calibrating a choice model. This enables us to make use of an existing calibration scheme for agent-oriented simulations.

Guo; Kai Cao; P. Wang,"Abstract. Population estimation statistics are widely used in government, commercial and educational sectors for a variety of purposes. With growing emphases on real-time and detailed population information, data users nowadays have switched from traditional census data to more technology-based data source such as LiDAR point cloud and High-Resolution Satellite Imagery. Nevertheless, such data are costly and periodically unavailable. In this paper, the authors use West Coast District, Singapore as a case study to investigate the applicability and effectiveness of using satellite image from Google Earth for extraction of building footprint and population estimation. At the same time, volunteered geographic information (VGI) is also utilized as ancillary data for building footprint extraction. Open data such as Open Street Map（OSM）could be employed to enhance the extraction process. In view of challenges in building shadow extraction, this paper discusses several methods including buffer, mask and shape index to improve accuracy. It also illustrates population estimation methods based on building height and number of floor estimates. The results show that the accuracy level of housing unit method on population estimation can reach 92.5 %, which is remarkably accurate. This paper thus provides insights into techniques for building extraction and fine-scale population estimation, which will benefit users such as urban planners in terms of policymaking and urban planning of Singapore.",XLII-2/W7,,1181,1187,Footprint; Geography; Satellite imagery; Ancillary data; Open data; Population; Unit (housing); Urban planning; Volunteered geographic information; Remote sensing,,10.5194/isprs-archives-xlii-2-w7-1181-2017,2755095370

As a prominent example, OpenStreetMap (OSM) creates a free editable map of the world from a large number of contributors. On the other hand, social media platforms such as Twitter or Instagram supply dynamic social feeds at population level. As much of such data is geo-tagged, there is a high potential on integrating social media with OSM to enrich OSM with semantic annotations, which will complement existing objective description oriented annotations to provide a broader range of annotations. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive framework on integrating social media data and VGI data to derive knowledge about geographical objects, specifically, top relevant annotations from tweets for objects in OSM. We first integrate geo-tagged tweets with OSM data with scalable spatial queries running on MapReduce. We propose a frequency based method for annotating boundary based geographic objects (a polygon), and a probability based method for annotating point based geographic objects (Latitude and Longitude), with consideration of noise. We evaluate our methods using a large geo-tagged tweets corpus and representative geographic objects from OSM, which demonstrates promising results through ground-truth comparison and case studies. We are able to produce up to 80% correct names for geographical objects and discover implicitly relevant information, such as popular exhibitions of a museum, the nicknames or visitors’ impression to a tourism attraction.",22,3,589,613,Geographic coordinate system; Polygon; Information retrieval; Population level; Exhibition; Computer science; Scalability; Social media; Volunteered geographic information; Geospatial analysis,,10.1007/s10707-018-0323-8,2808858691

However, there is some doubt regarding the generalizability of the models trained and validated on available datasets. This is due to dataset biases, which occur when the same semantic label is used in different ways across datasets, and/or when identical object categories are labeled differently across datasets. In this paper, we demonstrate the existence of dataset biases with a sample of eight remote sensing image datasets, first showing they are readily discriminable from a feature perspective, and then demonstrating that a model trained on one dataset is not always valid on others. Past approaches to reducing dataset biases have relied on crowdsourcing, however this is not always an option (e.g., due to public-accessibility restrictions of images), raising the question: How to structure annotation tasks to efficiently and accurately annotate images with a limited number of nonexpert annotators? We propose a collaborative annotation methodology, conducting image annotation experiments where users are placed in either a collaborative or individual condition, and we analyze their annotation performance. Results show the collaborators produce more thorough, precise annotations, requiring less time than the individuals. Collaborators labels show less variance around the consensus point, meaning their assigned labels are more predictable and likely to be generally accepted by other users. Therefore, collaborative image annotation is a promising annotation methodology for creating reliable datasets with a reduced number of nonexpert annotators. This in turn has implications for the creation of less biased image datasets.",10,6,2462,2477,Semantics; Image retrieval; Automatic image annotation; Information retrieval; Generalizability theory; Annotation; Earth observation; Computer science; Crowdsourcing; Synthetic aperture radar,,10.1109/jstars.2017.2697003,2616046787

Volunteered geographic information (VGI) involves citizens in the collection of data about their spatial environment. There is a growing interest in using existing VGI to update authoritative databases. This paper presents a framework aimed at integrating multi-source VGI based on a data fusion technique, in order to update an authoritative land use database. Each VGI data source is considered to be an independent source of information, which is fused together using Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST). The framework is tested in the updating of the authoritative land use data produced by the French National Mapping Agency. Four data sets were collected from several in-situ and remote campaigns run between 2018 and 2020 by contributors with varying profiles. The data fusion approach achieved an overall accuracy of 85.6% for the 144 features having at least two contributions when the confidence threshold was set to 0.05. Despite the heterogeneity and limited amount of VGI used, the results are promising, with 99% of the LU polygons updated or enriched. These results show the potential of using multi-source VGI to update or enrich authoritative LU data and potentially LULC data more generally.",,,1,30,Dempster–Shafer theory; Polygon; Land cover; Multi-source; Sensor fusion; Computer science; Land use; Volunteered geographic information; Data set; Database,,10.1080/17538947.2020.1842524,3096981884

Participatory mapping infrastructures using decentralized system architecture can link data and mapping services, transforming siloed datasets to integrated systems managed and shared across multiple organizations. The final asset mapping infrastructure includes a flexible and cloud-based data management system, an interactive web map, and community asset data stream. By allowing for a dynamic, reproducible, adaptive, and participatory asset mapping system, health systems infrastructures can further support community health improvement frameworks by facilitating shared data and decision support implementations across health partners.

The methodology uses publicly available volunteer geographic information, compiled in a spatial database with places (tracks) where these activities occur, in order to measure the use intensity. Results show: (1) the rate of biker and runner compliance with the park's trails, and (2) places where potential conflicts among users are likely to happen. Profiling user's preferences can help managers and decision makers to design proper infrastructure for outdoor activities. Strategic management errors can be avoided by knowing user preferences in urban parks, and by offering improved conditions which meet the expectations and needs of different user groups. Management implications This paper presents an efficient method to detect spatial overlaps between different recreational activities which is useful when financial and personnel resources for monitoring visitors in recreational urban green areas are scarce.

Clyde; Bridie McGreavy; Muki Haklay; Heidi L. Ballard; Steven Gray; Russell Scarpino; R. Hauptfeld; David Thomas Mellor; J. Gallo,"Many citizen science projects are place-based - built on in-person participation and motivated by local conservation. When done thoughtfully, this approach to citizen science can transform humans and their environment. Despite such possibilities, many projects struggle to meet decision-maker needs, generate useful data to inform decisions, and improve social-ecological resilience. Here, we define leveraging the ‘power of place’ in citizen science, and posit that doing this improves conservation decision making, increases participation, and improves community resilience. First, we explore ‘place’ and identify five place dimensions: social-ecological, narrative and name-based, knowledge-based, emotional and affective, and performative. We then thematically analyze 134 case studies drawn from CitSci.org (n = 39), The Stewardship Network New England (TSN-NE; n = 39), and Earthwatch (n = 56) regarding: (1) use of place dimensions in materials (as one indication of leveraging the power of place), (2) intent for use of data in decision-making, and (3) evidence of such use. We find that 89% of projects intend for data to be used, 46% demonstrate no evidence of use, and 54% provide some evidence of use. Moreover, projects used in decision making leverage more (t = − 4.8, df = 117; p < 0.001) place dimensions (View the MathML source= 3.0; s = 1.4) than those not used in decision making (View the MathML source= 1.8; s = 1.2). Further, a Principal Components Analysis identifies three related components (aesthetic, narrative and name-based, and social-ecological). Given these findings, we present a framework for leveraging place in citizen science projects and platforms, and recommend approaches to better impart intended outcomes. We discuss place in citizen science related to relevance, participation, resilience, and scalability and conclude that effective decision making as a means towards more resilient and sustainable communities can be strengthened by leveraging the power of place in citizen science.",208,,55,64,Environmental resource management; Psychological resilience; Sustainable community; Citizen science; Narrative; Sustainability science; Public participation; Community resilience; Open data; Knowledge management,,10.1016/j.biocon.2016.07.019,2509089500

The algorithm is evaluated using a reference dataset and VGI from the Map Kibera Project. A confusion matrix comparison between the reference dataset and µ-shape's output demonstrated high sensitivity and accuracy. Analysis of variance indicated that the algorithm was able to distinguish between boundary and interior blocks.

One of the problems in urban areas is the traffic. Every day at big cities people lose time, money, and life quality when they get stuck in traffic jams; another urban problem derived from traffic is air pollution. In the present approach, a traffic event classification methodology is implemented to analyze VGI and internet information related to traffic events with a view to identify the main traffic problems in a city and to visualize the congested roads. The methodology uses different computing tools and algorithms to achieve the goal. To obtain the data, a social media and RSS channels are consulted. The extracted data texts are classified into seven possible traffic events, and geolocalized. In the classification, a machine learning algorithm is applied. </jats:p>",,,141,162,Mexico city; Computer science; Volunteered geographic information; Cartography,,10.4018/978-1-5225-7347-0.ch008,2891801823

Five different socio-economic factors of the region are tested to find their relationship, if any, with dataset growth.

Furthermore, it is found that these mappers use other Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) and government open-dataset to feed into OSM. This study is believed to bring some high level insights of OSM for a developing country which would be useful for geographers, open-data policy makers, VGI projects planners and data-curators to structure and deploy similar future projects.</jats:p>",11,1,140,151,Geography; Cartography,,10.1515/geo-2019-0012,2940206239

This paper examines the feasibility of using data from OpenStreetMap (OSM), Facebook and Foursquare as a source of information on the function of buildings. Such information is rarely openly available and if available, would vary between cities by nomenclature, making comparisons between places difficult. Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) including data from social media represents new potential sources of building function data that have not yet been exploited for this purpose. Using a part of the city of Milan as the study area, building data from OSM and points of interest (POIs) from OSM, Facebook and Foursquare were extracted to derive the building function. This resulted in the classification of building function for more than 80 % of the buildings and demonstrated that both Facebook and Foursquare can complement the building function derived from OSM, helping to fill in missing gaps. This preliminary study has demonstrated the potential of this approach for deriving building function information from open data in a simple way yet still requires independent validation with alternative sources as well as extension to other areas that have different amounts of OSM and social media coverage.",624,,209,215,Point of interest; Data science; Open data; Computer science; Social media; Volunteered geographic information,,,2890748660

However, while massive and manifold data is continuously produced voluntarily and applications are built for information and knowledge extraction, the initially introduced concept of VGI lacks certain methodological perspectives in this regard which have not been fully elaborated. In this article we highlight and discuss an important gap in this concept, i.e. the lack of formal acknowledgment of temporal aspects. By coining the proposed advanced framework ‘Volunteered Geo-Dynamic Information’ (VGDI), we attempt to lay the ground for full conceptual and applied spatio-temporal integration. To illustrate that integrative approach of VGDI and its benefits, we describe the potential impact on the field of dynamic population distribution modeling. While traditional approaches in that domain rely on survey-based data and statistics as well as static geographic information, the use of VGDI enables a dynamic setup. Foursquare venue and user check-in data are presented for a test site in Lisbon, Portugal.

We present two smartphone applications that have been developed and applied in two EU projects (FP7 CITI-SENSE and H2020 hackAIR) to obtain citizens’ perception of AQ. We focus on observations reported through the smartphone apps for the greater Oslo area in Norway. In order to evaluate whether the reports on perceived AQ contain information about the actual spatial patterns of AQ, we carried out a comparison of the perception data against the output from the high-resolution urban AQ model EPISODE. The results indicate an association between modelled annual average pollutant concentrations and the provided perception reports. This demonstrates that the spatial patterns of perceived AQ are not entirely random but follow to some extent what would be expected due to proximity of emission sources and transport. This information shows that VGI about citizens’ perception of AQ has the potential to identify areas with low environmental quality for urban development.</jats:p>",5,4,45,58,Environmental resource management; Air quality index; Spatial ecology; Geography; Perception; Annual average; Smartphone application; Urban planning; Volunteered geographic information; Environmental quality,,10.17645/up.v5i4.3165,3093079568

Specifically, we have investigated the long-term effects of using VGI in education to find out whether students who have come across VGI in class remain interested in the topic and engage in the communities. For this purpose, we have created a survey that was circulated among students of past VGI classes at different levels.

Using data generated from the crowd has become a hot topic for several application domains including transportation. However, there are concerns regarding the quality of such datasets. As one of the most famous crowdsourced mapping platforms, we analyze the fitness for use of OpenStreetMap (OSM) database for routing and navigation of people with limited mobility. We assess the completeness of OSM data regarding sidewalk information. Relevant attributes for sidewalk information such as sidewalk width, incline, surface texture, etc. are considered, and through both extrinsic and intrinsic quality analysis methods, we present the results of fitness for use of OSM data for routing services of disabled persons. Based on empirical results, it is concluded that OSM data of relatively large spatial extents inside all studied cities could be an acceptable region of interest to test and evaluate wheelchair routing and navigation services, as long as other data quality parameters such as positional accuracy and logical consistency are checked and proved to be acceptable. We present an extended version of OSMatrix web service and explore how it is employed to perform spatial and temporal analysis of sidewalk data completeness in OSM. The tool is beneficial for piloting activities, whereas the pilot site planners can query OpenStreetMap and visualize the degree of sidewalk data availability in a certain region of interest. This would allow identifying the areas that data are mostly missing and plan for data collection events. Furthermore, empirical results of data completeness for several OSM data indicators and their potential relation to sidewalk data completeness are presented and discussed.

To address this issue, an assessment approach based on symmetric arc similarity is proposed, and the geometric quality of a VGI road network is assessed by its conformity with the corresponding ground truth road network, the results being visualized as hierarchical thematic maps. To compute the conformity, the geometric similarity between the VGI road arc and the corresponding ground truth road arc, which is selected by the adaptive searching distance, is measured based on the symmetric arc similarity method; the geometric quality is assessed based on an assessment matrix. Also, the symmetric arc similarity method is independent of directions and with a feature of shift-independence, which is applicable to assess the geometric qualities of different VGI road networks and makes the assessment result consistent with the actual situation of the real world.

Cloud Computing has emerged as a new paradigm to provide computing as a utility service for addressing different processing needs with a) on demand services, b) pooled resources, c) elasticity, d) broad band access and e) measured services. The utility of delivering computing capability fosters a potential solution for the transformation of Big Data's 4 Vs into the 5th (value).

As such, it is important that we explore ways measure preparedness to such disasters. In a previous work (Kunwar et al. in Evacuation time estimate for a total pedestrian evacuation using queuing network model and volunteered geographic information, 2015, [5]), we used agent based modelling (ABM) to investigate 50 cities in the UK and draw a link between their attributes such as spatial size, population, exit width and their evacuation time estimates (ETE) for a full city evacuation, one of the most stressing mobility use cases for a city. In this work, we examine the efficacy of those results by looking at how sensitive they are to fundamental diagram parameters. We found the overall ETE to be most sensitive to density threshold for minimum velocity with variations as large as an order of magnitude. We observed that ETE is also sensitive to maximum density limit but the results keep within the same order of magnitude. We also saw an increasing gap in ETE for lowest and highest values of density threshold for minimum velocity with every doubling of population. We reached a conclusion that it is necessary to carefully establish the input parampAGNeters if a robust result is desired for a network-based ‘mesoscopic’ modelling.",,,289,295,Statistics; Transport engineering; Preparedness; Pedestrian; Population; Extreme events; Queuing network model; Computer science; Sustainable development; Volunteered geographic information; Maximum density,,10.1007/978-3-319-33482-0_37,2560101334

The difference of this approach with respect to the traditional methods based on monitoring stations is that it is much less costly, which is a major innovation in developing countries. This approach is based on a GIS approach that consists of an application for mobile devices and a web mapping application; including Geospatial Analysis and Machine Learning methods for the acoustic noise prediction using contextual information. With this approach it will be possible to define actions to mitigate the effects of environmental noise, it is aligned in the context of the smart cities.

Such comparisons can be technically challenging and no software implementation exists which facilitates them easily and automatically. In this article we develop and propose a flexible methodology for comparing the geometry of OSM road network data with other road datasets. Quantitative measures for the completeness and spatial accuracy of OSM are computed, including the compatibility of OSM road data with other map databases. Our methodology provides users with significant flexibility in how they can adjust the parameterization to suit their needs.

Towards Truth in Labeling for Crowdsourced Geographic Information,2012-06-29,2012,book chapter,Crowdsourcing Geographic Knowledge,,Springer Netherlands,,Francis Harvey,"Geographers, planners, and others increasingly refer to crowdsourced data in geography as volunteered geographic information (VGI). But is volunteered the right adjective to use for all types of crowdsourced geographic information? This chapter examines this question by making the following distinction along an ethical line for crowdsourced data collection: data collected following an “opt-in” agreement is volunteered; data collected under an “opt-out” provision is contributed (CGI). Opt-in agreements provide some clarity and control in the collection and intended reuse of collected data. Opt-out agreements are, in comparison, very open-ended and begin with few, if any, possibilities to control data collection. The chapter suggests that distinguishing contributed crowdsourced data from volunteered crowdsourced data is important to start to understand the nature of sources of crowdsourced data of any provenance and to help begin to identify possible biases. In the concluding discussion, this chapter argues that the simple distinction between CGI and VGI is valuable for assessments of data’s fitness for use. Following the truth-in-labeling principle known for food products, differentiating between CGI and VGI is also helpful to identify cases where lax approaches or even malfeasance leads to inaccurate or biased crowdsourced data.",,,31,42,Data collection; Political science; Data science; CLARITY; Food products; Control data; Public relations; Volunteered geographic information,,10.1007/978-94-007-4587-2_3,124608906

Comber; Cidália Costa Fonte; Giles M. Foody; Steffen Fritz; Paul Harris; Ana-Maria Olteanu-Raimond; Linda See,"There is much interest in being able to combine crowdsourced data. One of the critical issues in information sciences is how to combine data or information that are discordant or inconsistent in some way. Many previous approaches have taken a majority rules approach under the assumption that most people are correct most of the time. This paper analyses crowdsourced land cover data generated by the Geo-Wiki initiative in order to infer the land cover present at locations on a 50 km grid. It compares four evidence combination approaches (Dempster-Shafer, Bayes, Fuzzy Sets and Possibility) applied under a geographically weighted kernel with the geographically weighted average approach applied in many current Geo-Wiki analyses. A geographically weighted approach uses a moving kernel under which local analyses are undertaken. The contribution (or salience) of each data point to the analysis is weighted by its distance to the kernel centre, reflecting Tobler's 1st law of geography. A series of analyses were undertaken using different kernel sizes (or bandwidths). Each of the geographically weighted evidence combination methods generated spatially distributed measures of belief in hypotheses associated with the presence of individual land cover classes at each location on the grid. These were compared with GlobCover, a global land cover product. The results from the geographically weighted average approach in general had higher correspondence with the reference data and this increased with bandwidth. However, for some classes other evidence combination approaches had higher correspondences possibly because of greater ambiguity over class conceptualisations and / or lower densities of crowdsourced data. The outputs also allowed the beliefs in each class to be mapped. The differences in the soft and the crisp maps are clearly associated with the logics of each evidence combination approach and of course the different questions that they ask of the data. The results show that discordant data can be combined (rather than being removed from analysis) and that data integrated in this way can be parameterised by different measures of belief uncertainty. The discussion highlights a number of critical areas for future research.",20,3,503,527,Statistics; Data mining; Majority rule; Geography; Bayes' theorem; Data quality; Ambiguity; Land cover; Fuzzy set; Volunteered geographic information; Weighted arithmetic mean,,10.1007/s10707-016-0248-z,2291520663

This article presents an evaluation of the validity of VGI to reveal historical geographic phenomena through a citizen data-based habitat suitability mapping case study. Citizen data (i.e., sightings) of the black-and-white snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus bieti) were elicited from local residents through three-dimensional (3D) geovisualization interviews in Yunnan, China. The validity of the elicited sightings to reveal the historical R. bieti distribution was evaluated through habitat suitability mapping using the citizen data in historical periods. The results of controlled experiments demonstrated that suitability maps predicted using the historical citizen data had a consistent spatial pattern (correlation above 0.60) that reflects the R. bieti distribution (Boyce index around 0.90) in areas free of significant environmental change across historical periods. This in turn suggests that citizen data have validity for mapping historical geographic phenomena.

The traditional model of formal - mainly  governmental - collection, storage and publishing of information is now complemented by a less formal and more personal data collection and publishing model. This includes geospatial information. This type of mapping has been called the ‘GeoWeb’, ‘Volunteered Geographic  Information’ (VGI) and ‘crowdsourcing’.

Several investigations have been done to determine the geometric accuracy of this data for the purposes of national mapping. Beyond accuracy, from a production perspective National Mapping Agencies will also be interested in the sufficiency and uniformity of the data. This paper presents an investigation of whether presently geographic data generated by volunteers is uniform across a country and whether the rate of production of data is consistent. For the purpose of the test, changes in data of South Africa from OpenStreetMap are analysed for the period 2006 to 2011. Here only point and line data are considered. The results generally show that the rate at which data is generated varies in space and time. The results also confirm that volunteers emphasise on the capture of certain information and that the capture doesn’t average out as might be expected. The results also showed that social events, such as a World Cup, also have the effect of spurring the generation of volunteer geographic data. The implication of these results for National Mapping Agencies is that they cannot treat volunteer geographic information as being of a uniform standard. How National Mapping Agencies respond to this will have to be the subject of other investigations.;                     </jats:p>",XXXIX-B4,1,553,558,Homogeneity (statistics); Geography; Volunteered geographic information; Cartography,,10.5194/isprsarchives-xxxix-b4-553-2012,2130635846

However, results can potentially vary significantly for different world regions. In this article, we conduct an analysis to determine similarities and differences in data contributions and community development in OSM between 12 selected urban areas of the world. Our findings showed significantly different results in data collection efforts and local OSM community sizes. European cities provide quantitatively larger amounts of geodata and number of contributors in OSM, resulting in a better representation of the real world in the dataset. Although the number of volunteers does not necessarily correlate with the general population density of the urban areas, similarities could be detected while comparing the percentage of different contributor groups and the number of changes they made to the OSM project.

We evaluated the degree to which the different OSM datasets agreed with two existing reference datasets (CORINE Land Cover and the official Portuguese Land Cover Map). We also evaluated whether our OSM dataset was of sufficiently high quality (in terms of both completeness accuracy and thematic accuracy) to be used as a sampling data source for multi-temporal LULC maps. In addition, we used the near boundary tag accuracy criterion to assesses the fitness of the OSM data for producing training samples, with promising results. For each annual dataset, the completeness ratio of the coverage area for the selected study area was low. Nevertheless, we found high thematic accuracy values (ranged from 77.3% to 91.9%). Additionally, the training samples thematic accuracy improved as they moved away from the features’ boundaries. Features with larger areas (>10 ha), e.g., Agriculture and Forest, had a steadily positive correlation between training samples accuracy and distance to feature boundaries.",8,3,116,,Rural area; Geography; Land cover; Land use land cover; Visualization; Land use; Volunteered geographic information; Cartography; Sampling (statistics); Thematic map,,10.3390/ijgi8030116,2917519025

The paper introduces different examples of e-tools used in participatory urban green infrastructure governance.

Through an analytical framework describing five categories, we discuss the different scopes and possibilities, as well as general barriers and problems to participatory e-tools. We suggest some basic premises for the application of e-tools in urban green infrastructure governance and discussed future development of this field. E-tools can allow interaction between citizens, public authorities, and other stakeholders; however, research on the implications of such location-based governance is needed to make full use of the rapid on-going development of such information and communication technologies, and to avoid possible pitfalls.

This increases the usefulness of Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI), in particular OpenStreetMap (OSM), as supplementary datasets or, in some cases, alternative sources of primary data. In contrast to the OSM street network, which has already been thoroughly investigated and found to be practically complete in many areas, the degree of completeness of OSM data on buildings is still unclear. In this paper we describe methods to analyze building completeness and apply these to various test areas in Germany. Official data from national mapping and cadastral agencies is used as a basis for comparison. The results show that unit-based completeness measurements (e.g., total number or area of buildings) are highly sensitive to disparities in modeling between official data and VGI. Therefore, we recommend object-based methods to study the completeness of OSM building footprint data. An analysis from November 2011 in Germany indicated a completeness of 25% in the federal states of North Rhine-Westphalia and 15% in Saxony. Although further analyses from 2012 confirm that data completeness in Saxony has risen to 23%, the rate of new data input was slowing in the year 2012",2,4,1066,1091,Footprint; Cadastre; Geography; Spatial planning; Street network; Data input; Highly sensitive; Completeness (statistics); Volunteered geographic information; Cartography,,10.3390/ijgi2041066,2004492980

The emergence of online digital mapping systems and enhancements in Web technology to support sharing and collaboration have allowed the general public to generate their own spatial content via Web applications and other geospatially enabled devices. The resulting data from this recent phenomenon has been called Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI). When facilitated through digital mapping interfaces, VGI can provide landscape architects and allied design professionals with local, detailed and spatial information that can be used to create a more informed design solution.

The research concludes that, when the work area has adequate station density, the best method for estimating GHI every 15 min is Regression Kriging interpolation using GHI estimated from satellite images as one of the input variables. On the contrary, when station density is low, the best method is estimating GHI directly from satellite images.

The discovery of hidden periodic patterns in spatiotemporal data could provide unveiling important information to the data analyst. In many applications that track and analyze spatiotemporal data, movements obey periodic patterns; the objects follow the same routes (approximately) over regular time intervals.

Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) crowdsourced from volunteering posts, is closely related to contributors’ mapping behavior. As the most noticeable VGI source, OpenStreetMap (OSM) is one of the most studied objectives in VGI and data contributors. In this paper, temporal-spatial analysis is applied in seeking the temporal and spatial patterns of the number of buildings and contributors in Beijing, China. Temporal changes of the number of updated buildings, and the population of total, new and quitted contributors, were interpreted, as well as the spatial distribution of updated buildings, participated contributors, and frequency of updates. The result suggests that the number of updated buildings, participated contributors, new and quitted contributors are growing. Buildings are mostly updated by a small number of contributors, the majority of which did not participated in mapping in the previous year. Most contributors update buildings for one year without succeeding till the next. Contributors are interested in updating a large amount of buildings frequently around landmarks, commercial districts, universities, and transit hubs. They update buildings at an expanding range and an increasing density, but their attentions do not necessarily bring large quantity of building updates. In general, OSM buildings in developing regions with less complete database are updated under similar patterns as developed regions where data are much more complete.",2,,1,10,Spatial ecology; China; Geography; Beijing; Population; Developing regions; Volunteered geographic information; Cartography,,10.5194/ica-proc-2-149-2019,2958348149

Salk; Tobias Sturn; Linda See; Steffen Fritz,"The idea that closer things are more related than distant things, known as ‘Tobler’s first law of geography’, is fundamental to understanding many spatial processes. If this concept applies to volunteered geographic information (VGI), it could help to efficiently allocate tasks in citizen science campaigns and help to improve the overall quality of collected data. In this paper, we use classifications of satellite imagery by volunteers from around the world to test whether local familiarity with landscapes helps their performance. Our results show that volunteers identify cropland slightly better within their home country, and do slightly worse as a function of linear distance between their home and the location represented in an image. Volunteers with a professional background in remote sensing or land cover did no better than the general population at this task, but they did not show the decline with distance that was seen among other participants. Even in a landscape where pasture is easily confused for cropland, regional residents demonstrated no advantage. Where we did find evidence for local knowledge aiding classification performance, the realized impact of this effect was tiny. Rather, the inherent difficulty of a task is a much more important predictor of volunteer performance. These findings suggest that, at least for simple tasks, the geographical origin of VGI volunteers has little impact on their ability to complete image classifications",8,9,774,,Tobler's first law of geography; Data mining; Citizen science; Geography; Data quality; Data science; Satellite imagery; Land cover; Population; Volunteered geographic information; Crowdsourcing,,10.3390/rs8090774,2522266675

Miller (2013) contends the need to identify new capabilities (instead of capacity) of the transport infrastructure in order to increase efficiency without extending the physical infrastructure. Kenyon and Lyons (2003) identified integrated traveller information as a facilitator for better transport decisions. Today, with further developments in the use of geographic information systems (GIS) and a greater disposition by the public to provide volunteered geographic information (VGI), the potential of information is not only integrated across modes but also user-generated, real-time and available on smartphones anywhere. This geographic information plays today an important role in sectors such as politics, businesses and entertainment, and presumably this would extend to transport in revealing people’s preferences for mobility and therefore be useful for decision-making. The widespread availability of networks and smartphones offer new opportunities supported by apps and crowdsourcing through social media such as the successful traffic and navigation app Waze, car sharing programmes such as Zipcar, and ride sharing systems such as Uber.

In order to better understand volunteered geographic drone videos (VGDV) from the social media and VGI perspective we conceptualize and discuss prospects and problems that could be explored in further research. This paper contributes to the development of theory about aerial drone videos, exploration of aerial drone video UGC characteristics and to the applicability of drone videos in Digital Earth systems.</jats:p>",11,1,462,470,User-generated content; Digital Earth; World Wide Web; Sociology; Volunteered geographic information; Drone,,10.1515/geo-2019-0037,2973781779

Hay,"The Heat Energy Assessment Technologies (HEAT) project uses high-resolution airborne thermal imagery, Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA), and a Geoweb environment to allow the residents of Calgary, Alberta, Canada to visualize the amount and location of waste heat leaving their houses, communities, and the city. To ensure the accuracy of these measures, the correct emissivity of roof materials needs to be known. However, roof material information is not readily available in the Canadian public domain. To overcome this challenge, a unique Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) application was developed using Google Street View that engages citizens to classify the roof materials of single dwelling residences in a simple and intuitive manner. Since data credibility, quality, and accuracy are major concerns when using VGI, a private Multiple Listing Services (MLS) dataset was used for cross-verification. From May–November 2013, 1244 volunteers from 85 cities and 14 countries classified 1815 roofs in the study area. Results show (I) a 72% match between the VGI and MLS data; and (II) in the majority of cases, roofs with greater than, or equal to five contributions have the same material defined in both datasets. Additionally, this research meets new challenges to the GEOBIA community to incorporate existing GIS vector data within an object-based workflow and engages the public to provide volunteered information for urban objects from which new geo-intelligence is created in support of urban energy efficiency",6,10,9691,9711,Workflow; Efficient energy use; Geoweb; Roof; Credibility; Geographic object; Computer science; Public domain; Volunteered geographic information; Remote sensing; Database,,10.3390/rs6109691,2046862850

164-348-519-967-010,Semantic trajectory inference from geo-tagged tweets,2019-07-15,2019,journal article,Abstracts of the ICA,25702106,Copernicus GmbH,,Qunying Huang; Xinyi Liu,"Abstract. Individual travel trajectories denote a series of places people visit along the time. These places (e.g., home, workspace, and park) reflect people’s corresponding activities (e.g., dwelling, work, and entertainment), which are discussed as semantic knowledge and could be implicit under raw data (Yan et al. 2013, Cai et al. 2016). Traditional survey data directly describe people’ activities at certain places, while costing tremendous labors and resources (Huang and Wong 2016). GPS data such as taxi logs record exact origin-destination pairs as well as people’s stay time along the way, from which semantics can be easily inferred combining with geographical context data (Yan et al. 2013). Research has been done to understand the activity sequences indicated by either individual or collective spatiotemporal (ST) travel trajectories using those dense data. Different models are proposed for trajectory mining and activity inference, including location categorization, frequent region detection, and so on (Njoo et al. 2015). A typical method for matching a location or region with a known activity type is to detect stay points and stay intervals of trajectories and to find geographical context of these stay occurrences (Furtado et al. 2013, Njoo et al. 2015, Beber et al. 2016, Beber et al. 2017). However, limited progress has been made to mine semantics of trajectory data collected from social media platforms. Specifically, detection of stay points and their intervals could be inaccurate using online trajectories because of data sparsity. Huang et al. (2014) define the notion of activity zone to detect activity types from digital footprints. In this method, individual travel trajectories first are aggregated using spatial clustering method such as density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN). Then produced clusters are classified based on a regional land use map and Google Places application programming interface (API). Such land use data are only published at specific places, such as the state cartography office’s website at University of Wisconsin-Madison. Researchers need to search for those data based on their study area. Moreover, while major land use maps can be searched for large areas such as the whole United States, detailed land use data for statewide or citywide areas are made in diverse standards, which adds extra work to classify activity zones consistently. Besides, Google Places API is a service that Google opened for developers and will return information about a place, given the place location (e.g., address or GPS coordinates), in the search request. However, API keys need to be generated before we can use these interfaces and each user can only make a limited number of free-charged requests every day (i.e., 1,000 requests per 24 hours period). In sum, previous methods to detect activity zone types using social media data are not sufficient and can hardly achieve effective data fusion. Comparing to the high cost of using officially published dataset, emerging Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) data offer an alternative to infer the types of an individual’s activities performed in each zone (i.e., cluster). Using geo-tagged tweets as an example, this research proposes a framework for mining social media data, detecting individual semantic travel trajectories, and individual representative daily travel trajectory paths by fusing with VGI data, specifically OpenStreetMap (OSM) datasets. First, inactive users and abnormal users (e.g., users representing a company with account being shared by many employees) are removed through data pre-processing (Step 1 in Figure 1). Next, a multi-scale spatial clustering method is developed to aggregate online trajectories captured through geo-tagged tweets of a group of users into collective spatial hot-spots (i.e., activity zones; Step 2). By integrating multiple OSM datasets the activity type (e.g., dwelling, service, transportation and work) of each collective zone then can be identified (Step 3). Each geo-tagged tweet of an individual, represented as a ST point, is then attached with a collective activity zone that either includes or overlaps a buffer zone of the ST point. Herein, the buffer zone is generated by using the point as the centroid and a predefined threshold as the radius. Given an individual’s ST points with semantics (i.e., activity type information) derived from the attached collective activity zone, a semantic activity clustering method is then developed to detect daily representative activity clusters of the individual (Step 4). Finally, individual representative daily semantic travel trajectory paths (i.e., semantic travel trajectory, defined as chronological travel activity sequences) are constructed between every two subsequent activity clusters (Step 5). Experiments with the historic geo-tagged tweets collected within Madison, Wisconsin reveal that: 1) The proposed method can detect most significant activity zones with accurate zone types identified (Figure 2); and 2) The semantic activity clustering method based on the derived activity zones can aggregate individual travel trajectories into activity clusters more efficiently comparing to DBSCAN and varying DBSCAN (VDBSCAN).",1,,129,2,Semantics; Raw data; Information retrieval; Sensor fusion; Computer science; DBSCAN; Volunteered geographic information; Cluster analysis; Big data; Application programming interface,,10.5194/ica-abs-1-129-2019,2958416812

If framed in the context of open, transparent and accountable governance then presumably VGI should advance dialogue and consultation between citizen and government. If governments perceive citizens as consumers of services then arguably such democratic intent elide when municipalities use VGI. Our empirical research shows how assumptions embedded in VGI drive the interaction between citizens and government. We created a typology that operationalises VGI as a potential act of citizenship and an instance of consumption. We then selected civic apps from Canadian cities that appeared to invoke these VGI types. We conducted interviews with developers of the apps; they were from government, private sector, and civil society. Results from qualitative semi-structured interviews indicate a blurring of consumer and citizen-centric orientations among respondents, which depended on motivations for data use, engagement and communication objectives, and sector of the respondent. Citizen engagement, an analogue for citizenship, was interpreted multiple ways. Overall, we found that government and developers may increase choice by creating consumer-friendly apps but this does not ensure VGI offers an act of civic participation. The burden is placed on the contributor to make it so. Apps and VGI could potentially further a data-driven and neoliberal government. Planners should be mindful of the dominance of a consumer-centric view even as they assume VGI invariably improves democratic participation.",1,2,141,154,Empirical research; Private sector; Web 2.0; Government; Political science; Civic engagement; Public administration; Corporate governance; Public relations; Civil society; Volunteered geographic information,,10.17645/up.v1i2.644,2473128379

The method capitalizes on ubiquitous mobile smartphones to empower collection of geospatially-referenced data. It is important to evaluate the validity of user-generated content for use in research or program planning. The purpose of this study was to test whether the aggregated environmental (“bikeability”) ratings from novice community residents converges with ratings from experts using a robust research-based, paper audit-tool (the established Pedestrian Environment Data Scan (PEDS) tool). Equivalence testing statistically showed overall agreement between the composite ratings of bikeability within the novice group. Agreement in categorical ratings between novices and experts were examined using the summary agreement index, which showed substantial agreement across the 10 locations rated by 11 novices using an f-VGI mobile application and four experts using PEDS; variability depended on the nature of the specific questions asked. Results reveal overall substantial agreement between novice and expert ratings for both composite scores and individual categorical ratings. However, additional research is needed to refine the methodology for use in formalized research applications.",83,3,477,488,User-generated content; Social environment; Engineering; Built environment; Pedestrian; Equivalence testing; Program planning; Categorical variable; Knowledge management; Volunteered geographic information; Applied psychology,,10.1007/s10708-017-9781-z,2617809277

Due to climate changes, wildfire breakouts get more frequent and difficult to control. In the mid-July 2017, the wildfire spread from wildland to the city of Split, the second-largest city in Croatia. This unpredictable spread almost caused the collapse of emergency response systems. Fortunately, a greater tragedy was avoided with the composure of the responsible services and the help of the citizens. The citizens helped in extinguishing the fire and timely provided the significant amount of disaster-related information on different platforms and through social media. In this paper, we address the problem of identifying useful Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) and georeferenced social media, for improving situation awareness while the wildfire was reaching the Croatian city of Split. Additionally, we combine social media with other external data sources (e. g. Sentinel-2 satellite images) and authoritative data (e.g. Croatian National Protection and Rescue Directorate official data and Public Fire Department of Split data) to establish the geographical relations between the wildfire phenomena and social media messages. In this manner, we seek to leverage the existing knowledge and data about the spatiotemporal characteristics of the Split wildfire in order to improve the identification of useful information from georeferenced social media with other integrated data sources that can be valuable for improving situation awareness in wildfire events.",XLII-3/W8,,415,420,Climate change; Situation awareness; Geography; Crisis mapping; Social media; Volunteered geographic information; Georeference; Leverage (finance); Croatian; Environmental planning,,10.5194/isprs-archives-xlii-3-w8-415-2019,2971271738

Shakeri; Abbas Alimohammadi; Abolghasem Sadeghi-Niaraki; Ali Asghar Alesheikh,"Spatial data is one of the most critical elements underpinning decision making for many disciplines. Accessing and sharing spatial data have always been a great struggle for researchers. Spatial data infrastructure (SDI) plays a key role in spatial data sharing by building a suitable platform for collaboration and cooperation among the different data producer organizations. In recent years, SDI vision has been moved toward a user-centric platform which has led to development of a new and enriched generation of SDI (third generation). This vision is to provide an environment where users can cooperate to handle spatial data in an effective and satisfactory way. User-centric SDI concentrates on users, their requirements and preferences while in the past, SDI initiatives were mainly concentrated on technological issues such as the data harmonization, standardized metadata models, standardized web services for data discovery, visualization and download. On the other hand, new technologies such as the GPS-equipped smart phones, navigation devices and Web 2.0 technologies have enabled citizens to actively participate in production and sharing of the spatial information. This has led to emergence of the new phenomenon called the Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI). VGI describes any type of content that has a geographic element which has been voluntarily collected. However, its distinctive element is the geographic information that can be collected and produced by citizens with different formal expertise and knowledge of the spatial or geographical concepts. Therefore, ordinary citizens can cooperate in providing massive sources of information that cannot be ignored. These can be considered as the valuable spatial information sources in SDI. These sources can be used for completing, improving and updating of the existing databases. Spatial information and technologies are an important part of the transportation systems. Planning, design and operation of the transportation systems requires the exchange of large volumes of spatial data and often close cooperation among the various organizations. However, there is no technical and organizational process to get a suitable data infrastructure to address diverse needs of the transportation. Hence, development of a common standards and a simple data exchange mechanism is strongly needed in the field of transportation for decision support. Since one of the main purposes of transportation projects is to improve the quality of services provided to users, it is necessary to involve the users themselves in the decision making processes. This should be done through a public participation and involvement in all stages of the transportation projects. In other words, using public knowledge and information as another source of information is very important to make better and more efficient decisions. Public participation in transportation projects can also help organizations to enhance their public supports; because the lack of public support can lead to failure of technically valid projects. However, due to complexity of the transportation tasks, lack of appropriate environment and methods for facilitation of the public participation, collection and analysis of the public information and opinions, public participation in this field has not been well considered so far. This paper reviews the previous researches based on the enriched SDI development and its movement toward the VGI by focusing on the public participation in transportation projects. To this end, methods and models that have been used in previous researches are studied and classified initially. Then, methods of the previous researchers on VGI and transportation are conceptualized in SDI. Finally, the suggested method for transportation projects is presented. Results indicate success of the new generation of SDI in integration with public participation for transportation projects.",XL-1/W3,,383,388,Decision support system; Engineering; Data exchange; Spatial data infrastructure; Emerging technologies; Data discovery; Public participation; Web service; Knowledge management; Volunteered geographic information,,10.5194/isprsarchives-xl-1-w3-383-2013,2115278869

Research on spatialization of demographic data plays an important role in grid transformation of social-economical data. Furthermore,as gridded population data can be effectively interoperate with geospatial data and remote sensing images, it is a useful supplement to census data. This paper reviewed spatialization methodologies, predictive modeling factors and typical datasets in the literature of population data spatialization research. Shortcomings of demographic data and advantages of spatial population distribution data are compared and summarized firstly. The spatialization methodologies are grouped into three categories, i.e., population distribution models from urban geography, areal interpolation methods and spatialization methods based on remote sensing and GIS. Population models from urban geography include the Clark's model and allometric growth model. The areal interpolation methods had been distinguished by point based method and area based method. Spatialization methods based on remote sensing and GIS are most widely used in nowadays, which can be further grouped into three categories for two reasons: one is the relationship between population and land use, urban area, traffic network, settlement density, image pixel characteristics, or other physical or socioeconomic characteristics, and the other is the calculation strategy. Various methods mentioned above have their own application environment and limitations. We reviewed the principles and applicability of every method in detail. After that, we generalized the frequently used factors in the spatialization process, involving land use/land cover, traffic network, topography, settlements density,night light, texture variable, and spectral reflectance. In the meantime, some typical research cases about the factors also were exemplified and analyzed. In addition, we introduced a few widely used spatial population distribution datasets or influential population spatialization projects. They consisted of China km grid population datasets, UNEP/GRID, GPW/GRUMP, LandScan, AfriPop AsiaPop AmriPop. The producers, resolution, characterization year and generation method of each one were presented exhaustively. Based on the above review,we discussed the current research problems and outlined research priorities in the future. The problems include the temporal inconsistency of input data, coarse resolution of demographic data, lack of in-depth study on scale effect, the scarcity of time series products and few validation works. To deal with these issues, more studies should be conducted to the following aspects: comprehension of population distribution mechanism, calculation of consistency and validation of existing datasets, application of multi-sources remote sensing data and volunteered geographic information, continuous space-time simulation of population distribution in the typical areas,sub-block-level population estimation, self-adaptive spatialization method which integrates multiple elements and multiple models. In summary, the research on spatialization of demographic data has made breakthroughs in the past two decades. Meanwhile, there are a few problems that need to be solved immediately. Since these two aspects had been reviewed as comprehensively as possible, we hope issues discussed in this paper could enlighten and promote the future study in this field.",,,,,Data mining; Grid; Geography; Spatialization; Land cover; Population; Population model; Urban geography; Volunteered geographic information; Geospatial analysis,,,2391675920
