abstract = {One of the principal objectives of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) is to solve water and development problems using methods that are environmentally sustainable, socially equitable, and efficient. In this chapter, we demonstrate how the principles of citizen science—the intrinsic involvement of nonscientist local stakeholders throughout the entire life cycle of a project—have the potential to complement and benefit those of IWRM; in particular, in relation to creating scientific evidence that underpins the governance of water resources. The rapid, recent development of information and communication technologies such as the Internet, smartphones, and social media has already demonstrated their capacity to make knowledge creation and governance more multidirectional, decentralized, diverse, and inclusive. We show how such new technologies can be harnessed with a citizen science approach to interrogate different aspects of the water cycle. One particularly promising development is to support citizen science with robust and low-cost sensor and networking technology. Such networks offer not only improved data coverage (especially in remote or data-scarce regions) but also enhanced sustainability at a time when monitoring networks are in decline globally. We argue that, in certain cases, citizen science and polycentric governance approaches can enrich and complement IWRM and merit greater attention.}

abstract = {Information systems built using standards-based distributed services have become the default computing paradigm adopted by the geospatial community for building information infrastructures also known as Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDIs). Government mandates such as the INSPIRE European Directive recommend standards for sharing resources (e.g., data and processes) with the goal of improving environmental (and related) decision making. Although SDIs present benefits to data providers in terms of data sharing and management, most geospatial infrastructures have been built following a top-down approach in which official providers (most commonly mapping agencies) are permitted to deploy and maintain resources. Because the mechanisms to deploy resources in these infrastructures are technologically complex, there has been limited participation from users, resulting in a scarcity of deployed resources. To address these limitations, we present a distributed architecture based on INSPIRE principles and extended with a Service Framework component. This component improves ad hoc integration and deployment of geospatial data resources within geospatial information infrastructures. The Service Framework addresses the need to improve the availability of geospatial data resources by providing mechanisms to assist users in wrapping resources to generate INSPIRE-based services.}

In this paper, we provide a systematic review of urban growth models, including the evolution of urban models and associated theories and the common framework of different models and their applications. Three typical classes of urban growth models, namely, the land use/transportation model, the cellular automata (CA) model and the agent-based model, were introduced. Their relationships were explained, considering their modelling mechanisms, data requirements and application scales. Based on the extensively utilized urban CA models, we proposed four perspectives for improvements, including the adjustment of the basic spatial unit, the incorporation of temporal contexts, public platforms to support model comparison, and scenario analyses. New opportunities (e.g., open social data and integrated assessment models) have emerged to assist model development and application.}

Although the data requirements of models have remained similar over the 5year period, the diversity of models used has decreased. There is evidence of increased application of models at point/site scale to support grains, dairy and livestock production industries in Victoria. Opportunities are identified to deliver finer scale soil data from digital soil mapping to better meet modelling requirements for agricultural industries in Victorian landscapes.}

One of the most important factors explaining this non-consideration is the lack of spatial information describing the nature-society relationship in environmental and economic analyses. In this paper, we developed a novel method to predict, in spatially explicit terms, the recreation attractiveness potential combining supply and demand factors. Our method is based on the combination and transfer of a Lancasterian function of biophysical aspects and a travel cost model based on agents' sociodemographic characteristics. We further validate the usefulness of the proposed recreation model by using it in the evaluation of a regional park charter pursuing two main objectives: recreational attractiveness and habitat quality (modeled with InVEST). The results demonstrate first that the biophysical context plays a large role in the recreational trip choice and thus should not be ignored in travel cost studies. Second, from a policy guidance perspective, we show that providing spatial information appears particularly critical for ES to be a useful lever for action in day-to-day decision-making.}

Due to socio-economic and legal issues in UBAs, the renovation process cannot be sufficiently realized without the intervention of both public and private sectors. As active involvement of owners, investors and urban managers in urban renovation increases the success of renewal projects, more considerable attention has been paid to owner-investor participatory models in the last few decades. In order to promote participatory urban renewal processes, a Spatial (GIS-based) Decision Support System (SDSS) has been developed. The primary objective of proposed SDSS is to present a general framework for the involvement of owners, investors, and urban managers in UBA processes. Through the integration of Public Participation Geographic Information System (PPGIS) with Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA), the proposed SDSS provides an appropriate tool for the facilitation of participatory renewal procedures in UBAs. In addition to entering, storing, manipulating, analyzing and representing spatial data related to UBAs, the system provides further features for stakeholders including spatial negotiation, weighting, prioritization, validation, monitoring, and decision rule capabilities. The SDSS has been implemented in Tehran, and its quality has been validated from the perspective of developers, experts, and end users (owners and investors) in accordance with the ISO/IEC_9126 standard. Based on three group’s opinion, the system is relatively acceptable in terms of functionality, reliability, usability, efficiency, maintainability, and portability in facilitating the urban renewal process.}

abstract = {The actual functions of a region may not reflect the intent of the original zoning scheme from planners. To identify the actual urban functional regions, numerous methods have been proposed with computational advancement. Specifically, remote sensing by image recognition, geodemographic classification, social sensing with big data and geo-text mining techniques have been widely applied. Points-of-interest (POIs) are one of the most common open-access data type used to extract information pertaining to functional zones. However, previous works have either lost sight or did not make full use of the spatial interactions that can be extracted from POIs due to model limitations in the context of geographical space. In this research, we introduced an approach that detects functional regions at the scale of a neighborhood area (NA) by combining POI data and a simplified Place2vec model, which is theorized from the first law of geography. First, the POI-based spatial context is constructed by using the nearest neighbor approach. Then, we can increase the number of training tuples (tcenter,tcontext) based on the weight derived from the distance between the POI tcenter and POI tcontext. Next, high-dimensional characteristic vectors of the POIs are extracted by using the skip-gram training framework. By summarizing the POI vectors at the NA level, we employ a K-means clustering model to cluster the functional regions. Compared with other probabilistic topic models (PTMs) and Word2vec, the Place2vec-based approach obtained the highest mean reciprocal rank value (MRR-SWP=0.356, MRR-SLC=0.401, MRR-SJC=0.433, and MRR-SLin=0.421) in terms of similarity capturing performance and functional region identification accuracy (OA=0.7424). The research has important implications to urban planning and governance.}

We aim first to quantify the multifaceted impacts, and then to develop a structured understanding of the influence and contribution associated with Google Earth. To accomplish these objectives, we analyzed a total of 2115 Scopus publication records using scientometric methods and then proceed to discussion with a selected set of applications. The findings and conclusions can be summarized as follows: (1) the impact of Google Earth has been profound and persistent over the past decade. Google Earth was mentioned in an average of 229 publications per year since 2009. (2) Broadly, the impact of Google Earth has touched upon most scientific disciplines. Specifically, during 2006–2016, Google Earth has been mentioned in 2115 publications covering all of Scopus’s 26 subject areas; (3) the influence of Google Earth has largely concentrated in GIScience, remote sensing and geosciences. The extended influence of Google Earth has reached a wider range of audiences with a concentration in fields such as human geography, geoscience education and archaeology.}

Although some research has been conducted to assess the effectiveness of the representation of demand- (population) or supply- (destinations) side characteristics within such models, there have been few attempts to assess the implications of using alternative sources of network data. This study employs a sensitivity analysis approach to assess accessibility to GP surgeries in south Wales using proprietary and open sources of network data. Results suggest that there are significant differences between access scores derived from the use of networks which purport to portray the same features. Furthermore, the pattern of differences varies between urban and rural areas. Case studies are used to show that the actual representation of network-based features, often overlooked in previous research, can have important implications for the findings from such studies. We conclude by suggesting that the use of sensitivity analysis to assess geospatial data usability has a wider relevance for studies that involve the use of a range of GIS-based techniques in different application areas.}

Specifically, we used information-rich server logs captured through a web-based platform for participatory transportation planning to identify groups of users with similar use patterns. The groups were derived through multiple sequence alignment and hierarchical cluster analysis based on varying user activity measures. Subsequently, we assessed the reliability of the classifications obtained from the two clustering methods. Our results indicate limited reliability of classifications of activity sequences through multiple sequence alignment analysis and robust groupings from hierarchical cluster analysis for user activity initiations and durations. The presented work contributes a novel methodological framework for the evaluation of complex software systems that extends beyond the common approach of soliciting user satisfaction.}

abstract = {Accurate delineation of global built-up area (BUA) is fundamental to a better understanding of human development and the impacts on global environmental change. Existing global datasets of human settlement were mostly generated at medium and coarse spatial resolutions, including BUA and other impervious surfaces. With multiple high-resolution satellite constellations now available (e.g., ZiYuan-3 (ZY3), SPOT-5/6/7, Cartosat-1/2, and WorldView-2/3), identifying the global BUA explicitly from the complex landscapes becomes possible. In this study, a novel method was proposed for automated extraction of BUA at the global scale, by fusing a series of building features. Specifically, two planar features, the Morphological Building Index (MBI) and Harris corner detector, were employed to characterize the structure and corner attributes of buildings. Moreover, two multi-angular built-up indices (MABIs), i.e., Ratio Multi-angular Built-up Index (RMABI) and Normalized Difference Multi-angular Built-up Index (NDMABI), were proposed to represent the vertical properties of buildings based on multi-view images, which can further complement the planar features. 45 global cities were selected to validate the performance of the proposed method with images acquired by the ZY3 satellite constellation. The results show that the fusion of MBI and Harris corner can achieve satisfactory accuracy, i.e., 91.12%, 88.85%, 82.82% and 0.85, for the average overall accuracy (OA), user's accuracy (UA), producer's accuracy (PA), and F1-score, respectively, for all the test cities. After fusing the MABIs with the planar features, the average OA, UA, PA and F values of the final results were 92.00%, 86.20%, 89.14% and 0.87 for the RMABI, and 91.83%, 85.51%, 89.62% and 0.87 for the NDMABI, respectively. In particular, addition of the MABIs can further reduce the omission errors where medium/high rise buildings with low local contrast exist. We compared our results with two existing state-of-the-art global BUA products, Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) and Global Urban Footprint (GUF), which further corroborated the effectiveness of our method.}

Using geographic big data that cover the entire country, this paper analyzes the urban development level (UDL) of newly added outlying patches within 275 cities at the prefecture level or above in China from 2005 to 2015. The results revealed the following. 1) High-value cities are primarily located in the east, whereas low-value cities are primarily located in the west. The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration (BTHUA) is a major area with low UDLs, whereas the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration (YRDUA) and the Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration (PRDUA) are major areas with high UDLs. 2) The results of a multivariate regression demonstrate that GDP per capita (GDPPC), average elevation (AE), the distance between the new outlying urban patches, the proportion of secondary industry in GDP (PSI), the average land price in the city (ALP), the original urban land areas (DIS), and economic balance (GDPSD) significantly affect the UDL values of these cities. Relatively higher GDPPC and ALP are associated with a significant increase in the UDL, while more AE, DIS, GDPSD and PSI will decrease the UDL. The results of this paper provide a reference to understand the conditions of outlying developmental zones in China over the past 10 years as well as to explore healthy and reasonable urban spatial expansion forms.}

To cope with the planning challenges this will bring, developing a retrospective understanding of urban land-use dynamics and the underlying driving-forces behind urban growth is a key prerequisite. This research uses regression-based land-use change models – and in particular non-spatial logistic regression models (LR) and auto-logistic regression models (ALR) – for the Mumbai region over the period 1973–2010, in order to determine the drivers behind spatiotemporal urban expansion. Both global models are complemented by a local, spatial model, the so-called geographically weighted logistic regression (GWLR) model, one that explicitly permits variations in driving-forces across space. The study comes to two main conclusions. First, both global models suggest similar driving-forces behind urban growth over time, revealing that LRs and ALRs result in estimated coefficients with comparable magnitudes. Second, all the local coefficients show distinctive temporal and spatial variations. It is therefore concluded that GWLR aids our understanding of urban growth processes, and so can assist context-related planning and policymaking activities when seeking to secure a sustainable urban future.}

Without easy access to fine-scale data, researchers have to rely heavily on statistical and aggregated indicators available in officially released yearbooks, to understand Chinese city system. Not to mention the data quality of yearbooks, it is problematic that a large number of towns or downtown areas of counties are not addressed in yearbooks. To address this issue, as a following study of Long et al. (2016), we have redefined the Chinese city system, using percolation theory in the light of newly emerging big/open data. In this paper, we propose our alternative definition of a city with road/street junctions, and present the methodology for extracting city system for the whole country with national wide road junctions. A city is defined as “a spatial cluster with a minimum of 100 road/street junctions within a 300 m distance threshold”. Totally we identify 4629 redefined cities with a total urban area of 64,144 km2 for the whole China. We observe total city number increases from 2273 in 2009 to 4629 in 2014. We find that expanded urban area during 2009 and 2014, comparing with urban areas in 2009 are associated with 73.3% road junction density, 25.3% POI density and 5.5% online comment density. In addition, we benchmark our results with the conventional Chinese city system by using yearbooks.}

Consequently, ensuring that the outcomes of decision-making processes are indeed consistent with the needs, values and preferences of the public is of critical importance. Accordingly, this study proceeds to employ Public Participation GIS (PPGIS) or citizen-generated information as reference data to validate the results of GIS-MCDA processes.

To this end, the issue of selecting the optimal sites for the establishment of restaurants in Babolsar, Mazandaran province, was selected as the case study. The study proceeded by initially determining the optimal locations of restaurants based on expert opinion and via the GIS-based Best-Worst multicriteria method. Next, a Web-based PPGIS tool was designed and implemented, enabling citizens to draw the optimal sites for restaurant establishment. Finally, the optimal locations determined via the multicriteria method (in three suitable, moderate and unsuitable classes) were compared and validated with PPGIS in accordance with the corresponding spatial indices. Although the suitable class of the GIS-MCDA output map (expert-derived restaurant sites), indicating preferences of experts, had the highest level of complete coverage (0.1%) and intersection (2.6%) with PPGIS (citizen-derived restaurant sites) as opposed to the other two classes, the validation results indicate a rather low level of consistency between experts’ solution and citizen opinions in the designation of proper sites for the establishment of restaurants.}

Although very different from each other, they are all becoming available as a side-effect since they were created with different purposes but their degree of popularity, pervasiveness and ease of access is turning them into interesting alternatives for researchers.

We explore the convergence between recent research in urban sustainability governance and crowdsourcing. This is done by reviewing the literature in order to acquire important evidence to support the inductive process of theory building, and to highlight the upcoming trends in participatory research and policy-making that exploit ICT and Web 2.0 social software. Our analysis indicates that a transformative relationship between data and people creates new forms of distant search for solutions and decision making. We argue that interest in crowdsourcing has expanded from computing researches to social and environmental applications. This new practical dimension unlocks the futures of integration of crowdsourcing into best practices in the governance of sustainability in an urban context. Building on evidence that implementing crowdsourcing into the forthcoming governance of urban sustainability is increasingly recognised as a common priority, the paper suggests policy makers to devote more resources to ensure openness, transparency, interoperability and adaptability of crowdsourcing platforms.}

This leaves a challenge for characterisation, modelling, forecasting and management activities. Here we demonstrate the value of community-based (‘citizen science’) observations for modelling and understanding catchment response as a contribution to catchment science. The scheme implemented within the 42km2 Haltwhistle Burn catchment, a tributary of the River Tyne in northeast England, has harvested and used quantitative and qualitative observations from the public in a novel way to effectively capture spatial and temporal river response. Community-based rainfall, river level and flood observations have been successfully collected and quality-checked, and used to build and run a physically-based, spatially-distributed catchment model, SHETRAN. Model performance using different combinations of observations is tested against traditionally-derived hydrographs. Our results show how the local network of community-based observations alongside traditional sources of hydro-information supports characterisation of catchment response more accurately than using traditional observations alone over both spatial and temporal scales. We demonstrate that these community-derived datasets are most valuable during local flash flood events, particularly towards peak discharge. This information is often missed or poorly represented by ground-based gauges, or significantly underestimated by rainfall radar, as this study clearly demonstrates. While community-based observations are less valuable during prolonged and widespread floods, or over longer hydrological periods of interest, they can still ground-truth existing traditional sources of catchment data to increase confidence during characterisation and management activities. Involvement of the public in data collection activities also encourages wider community engagement, and provides important information for catchment management.}

These attitudes are posited to be influenced by geographic (spatial) discounting wherein the distance from domicile may contribute to local opposition or support. In contrast to specific development projects, the potential influence of NIMBY/YIMBY in a general land use planning process has not been systematically evaluated. In this study, we analyzed empirical data from a public participation GIS (PPGIS) process implemented for a general plan revision to examine the evidence for geographic discounting for a range of land uses using mapped preferences by community residents. Using distance analysis, we found significant evidence for geographic discounting by land use type with variable discount rates influenced by location of residence and the spatial configuration of land use in the planning area represented by zoning. The findings were consistent with NIMBY/YIMBY expectations with the exception of residential development where the results were more ambiguous. Residents want future land uses with amenities (open space, recreation, and trails) closer to domicile and more intensive, developed land uses (commercial, tourism, events, parking) further away. The findings have potentially broad implications because general/comprehensive planning—a requirement of most local governments in the U.S.—is operationalized through land use zones that appear subject to spatial discounting and the manifestation of potential NIMBY/YIMBY effects in the planning process. Future research should examine other planning contexts such as large urban areas with a greater diversity of land uses.}

Combined with the presence of pervasive coastal threats, such as flooding and erosion, this is having widespread impacts on coastal populations, infrastructure and ecosystems. For the right adaptive strategies to be adopted, and planning decisions to be made, rigorous evaluation of the available options is required. This evaluation hinges on the availability and use of suitable datasets. For knowledge to be derived from coastal datasets, such data needs to be combined and analysed in an effective manner. This paper reviews a wide range of literature relating to data-driven approaches to coastal risk evaluation, revealing how limitations have been imposed on many of these methods, due to restrictions in computing power and access to data. The rapidly emerging field of ‘Big Data’ can help overcome many of these hurdles. ‘Big Data’ involves powerful computer infrastructures, enabling storage, processing and real-time analysis of large volumes and varieties of data, in a fast and reliable manner. Through consideration of examples of how ‘Big Data’ technologies are being applied to fields related to coastal risk, it becomes apparent that geospatial Big Data solutions hold clear potential to improve the process of risk based decision making on the coast. ‘Big Data’ does not provide a stand-alone solution to the issues and gaps outlined in this paper, yet these technological methods hold the potential to optimise data-driven approaches, enabling robust risk profiles to be generated for coastal regions.}

The roles and the relationships among the actors may vary according to the underlying planning paradigm or style which the local normative and socio-cultural factors shape in the actual practices. Methods and tools to be used in the process phases may vary accordingly. A Geodesign study is characterised by the integrated usage of Geographic Information Science methods and tools to transform spatial data into relevant knowledge for informed design and decision-making. Thus, central to Geodesign are such issues as how to design and manage such complex processes, and how to orchestrate digital methods and tools in Geodesign support systems architectures. To address these challenges, the concept of metaplanning is proposed as an aid to the design of Geodesign processes. Expected benefits of the metaplanning exercise include better process understanding by the participants, improvements in management, and enhanced process transparency and accountability. Moreover, metaplanning may drive the integration of digital information technologies to support the Geodesign workflows. After the formalization of the concept, a Business Process Management (BPM) approach to metaplanning is proposed for its operationalization, aiming at both improving the Geodesign process and easing the creation of process-oriented 2nd generation Planning Support Systems. After a critical discussion on the possible advantages of the metaplanning approach to the design of process-oriented Geodesign workflows and support systems, issues setting the future research agenda in this domain are outlined.}

Identifying areas that are likely to be pivotal in land use planning decisions from both social and ecological perspectives provides one means of integration. Social-ecological “hotspots” represent valuable areas from both human and environmental perspectives but appropriate and valid methods for identifying such areas are under-developed. We applied an inductive research approach using empirical spatial data from a regional study in Australia to evaluate alternative methods for identifying social-ecological hotspots. Social data measuring the importance of the landscape was collected using public participation geographic information systems (PPGIS) while ecologically valuable areas were identified from species distributions and Zonation conservation prioritization software. We applied multiple importance thresholds (cut-offs) to separately identify and measure social and ecological hotspots, and then quantified the degree of spatial concurrence (overlap) when combining the layers to generate social-ecological hotspots. Based on the findings, we developed guidelines for identifying social-ecological hotspots under variable data conditions. We describe the practical implications of our findings by showing how the selected method for SES hotspot identification can enhance or limit the utility of hotspot analysis for decision support in regional conservation planning.}

This commonly observed hazard causes some road sections to be closed and may even disconnect the road network. In the immediate disaster response phase work teams are dispatched to open a subset of roads to reconnect the network. Closed roads are traversable only after they are unblocked/cleared by one of the teams. The main objective of this research is to provide an efficient solution method to generate a synchronized work schedule for the road clearing teams. The solution should specify the synchronized routes of each clearing team so that: 1) connectivity of the network is regained, and 2) none of the closed roads are traversed unless their unblocking/clearing procedure is finished. In this study we develop an exact Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) formulation to solve this problem. Furthermore, we propose a matheuristic that is based on an MIP-relaxation and a local search algorithm. We prove that the optimality gap of the relaxation solution is bounded by K times the lower bound obtained from the relaxed model, where K is the number of teams. We show computationally that the matheuristic obtains optimal or near-optimal solutions.}

This chapter describes an international Canadian–Caribbean coastal community-based research initiative designed to raise awareness among, and to communicate to, community members, the evidence of local impacts of climate change and to examine adaptation strategies to address these impacts. Selected Canadian and Caribbean coastal communities are first characterized by their physical environment and their economic, social, and cultural assets as well as the predicted vulnerabilities and threats. Community priorities are captured to develop and then evaluate alternatives for adaptive strategies. These alternatives, applied in specific local contexts, include the suite of adaptive strategies to (1) protect the community from the expected impacts of coastal environmental change, (2) accommodate the impacts through managed resilience, (3) retreat from the coastal zone in order to reduce inhabitants' vulnerabilities, and (4) do nothing—the most common strategy in practice—in preparation for the expected impacts. Top-down and bottom-up collaborative efforts of the communities of practice within the coastal zone are required to manage adaptation in the coastal zone. Bottom-up enhancement is delivered through the direct engagement of community education beginning with the local school children. Top-down enhancement seeks community participation for the establishment of new municipal governance and strategic integrated policy toward improved coastal sustainably under the threats of the changing climate.}

The present study implements and compares three mapping approaches including Multi-Criteria Evaluation (MCE), Logistic Regression (LR) and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network in a GIS environment for landscape aesthetic suitability mapping in the Ziarat watershed basin of northeastern Iran. Ground truth data were collected during several field observations and landscape photographs were taken in winter and autumn. Mapping algorithms were compared for their spatial accuracy using the Receiving Operator Characteristic (ROC) method and the comparison was made for automatic identification of scenic beauty on routes applying landscape metrics. According to the results, the ROC statistic scored at 0.94, 0.93 and 0.88 for MLP, LR and MCE methods, respectively. In addition, landscape metrics-derived results depicted the MLP method as more successful for automated delineation of a connected network of scenic routes. Finally, due to acceptable spatial accuracy, this study suggests expert-based mapping methods such as MCE and statistical algorithms such as LR can be used as ground truth layers for a sampling of presence/absence data. The map containing sampled points can be used as a training layer for iterative artificial intelligence-based methods such as MLP for quick and accurate suitability mapping of landscape aesthetics in neighboring watersheds. This application demonstrates how landscape aesthetics as one of cultural ecosystem services can be integrated into land-use planning practices.}

This question fits into broader discussions on how knowledge construction, circulation and utilization can improve competences in local government (efficiency and effectiveness), make urban planning more knowledge-based, and provide greater recognition of citizens' knowledge (accountability). Local governments need such instruments in dealing with increasing complexity and uncertainty in urban development. We examine how uneven patterns of technological change in using ICT and GIS are transforming current local government work processes in terms of efficiency and effectiveness in their outcomes, utilizing empirical data from extended case studies in six medium-sized cities in India, South Africa, Brazil, and Peru, participating in the Chance2Sustain research network. Knowledge management in cities is configured through several dimensions: 1) discourses for digitizing KM in local urban development; 2) actor networks producing socio-spatial knowledge; 3) embedding KM in decision-making processes (power struggles, exclusion); and 4) influences of KM on work practices and interfaces with citizens. The case study results show that 1) KM discourses concerned four issues: strategic urban planning and integrated land use planning; determining geographic boundaries in urban development discourses; streamlining work processes of local governments, and mapping poverty and needs assessments; 2) initiatives mainly link government with the private sector at various scale levels; 3) codified and technical knowledge remains dominant in discussions on urban development; and 4) effects of KM are uneven, but improve work process efficiency, although the interface with citizens remains limited, focusing on middle-class relations to the exclusion of the poor.}

Consequently, information systems are required to deal with large datasets containing raw data to build high level abstractions. Semantic Web technologies offer powerful representation tools for pervasive applications. The convergence of location-based services and Semantic Web standards allows an easier interlinking and annotation of trajectories. However, due to the wide range of requirements on modeling mobile object trajectories, it is important to define a high-level data model for representing trajectory episodes and contextual elements with multiple levels of granularity and different options to represent spatial and temporal extents, as well as to express quantitative and qualitative semantic descriptions. In this article, we focus on modeling mobile object trajectories in the context of Semantic Web. First, we introduce a new version of the Semantic Trajectory Episodes (STEP) ontology to represent generic spatiotemporal episodes. Then, we present FrameSTEP as a new framework for annotating semantic trajectories based on episodes. As a result, we combine our ontology, which can represent spatiotemporal phenomena at different levels of granularity, with annotation algorithms, which allow to create instances of our model. The proposed spatial annotation algorithm explores the Linked Open Data cloud and OpenStreetMap tags to find relevant types of spatial features in order to describe the environment where the trajectory took place. Our framework can guide the development of future expert systems in trajectory analysis. It enables reasoning about knowledge gathered from large trajectory data and linked datasets in order to create several intelligent services.}

The proposed method is developed as an analytic network process (ANP) that contains grey numbers and multiple assessment criteria. The grey ANP is unique in bikeability literature and overcomes the disadvantages of existing assessment methods in the following ways. (1) The ANP framework can manage the interdependences among criteria and zones, (2) the multiple assessment criteria can consider comprehensive perspectives of bikeability, and (3) the grey numbers measure possible ranges of criteria performances and are good at handling various performances within a zone. The application of the method to the bikeability assessment of zones in Daan District, Taipei City, Taiwan not only verifies the effectiveness of the method but also provides action directions to the local administration in developing bike-friendly environments.}

These contributions fall in the area of human-centric sensing, area specialized in using what people spontaneously say on social media to detect the occurrence of given events. Research in this area has exhibited interesting results, regardless of the accuracy of sensing operations. In fact, in some cases it is possible to corroborate the information extracted from OSN posts with the ground truth obtained from specialized hardware sensors. In others, the information extracted from OSNs does not reveal true environmental conditions. Nevertheless, OSNs may help shed light on the sensitivity of human beings to a wide variety of environmental phenomena. We here review the work that has been published to this date. In particular, we provide a survey that may benefit both environmental and computer scientists, as this work aims to show where we stand in the understanding of the complex relationship between human beings and the natural environment, when this is mediated by OSNs.}

Advancements in technologies and the proliferation of smartphones have created new data sources that can help eliminate limitations related to small sample size and infrequent updates due to limited resources. This study reviews the emerging data sources and their current use, focusing on non-motorized travel monitoring. In this study, the emerging data are categorized into mode-unspecified and mode-specified data based on whether the mode used can be detected with no or little effort. While mode-unspecified data are collected without sorting out non-motorized travelers, mode-specified data at least know who (which mode) is being monitored. So far, commercial vendors provide a vast volume of mode-unspecified data, but their products have been mainly used for motorized trips or are in initial stages of development. Meanwhile, readily available data sources and their applications are more concentrated on mode-specified data, which have enabled varying non-motorized travel studies—including travel pattern identification, route-choice modeling, crash/air pollution exposure estimation, and new facility provision evaluation—but are mostly focused on bicycling. Despite the potential of emerging data, their use also has several challenges, such as limited mode inference, sample bias, and lack of detailed trip/traveler information due to privacy issues. More efforts are needed, such as improving data accuracy and developing robust data fusion techniques, to be able to fully utilize the emerging data sources.}

We have developed a method for generating a privacy-preserving heat map with user diversity (ppDIV), in which the density of trajectories, as well as the diversity of users, is taken into account, thus preventing the bias effects caused by participation inequality. The method is applied to public cycling workouts and compared with privacy-preserving kernel density estimation (ppKDE) focusing only on the density of the recorded trajectories and privacy-preserving user count calculation (ppUCC), which is similar to the quadrat-count of individual application users. An awareness of privacy was introduced to all methods as a data pre-processing step following the principle of k-Anonymity. Calibration results for our heat maps using bicycle counting data gathered by the city of Helsinki are good (R2>0.7) and raise high expectations for utilizing heat maps in a city planning context. This is further supported by the diurnal distribution of the workouts indicating that, in addition to sports-oriented cyclists, many utilitarian cyclists are tracking their commutes. However, sports tracking data can only enrich official in-situ counts with its high spatio-temporal resolution and coverage, not replace them.}

Any such delineation must eventually be cast onto administrative boundaries, an essential requirement for real-world applications. In the effort of relating administrative and alternative boundaries, we investigated in Italy the validity of general scaling laws, such as the area-population relation, and proposed a practical application. Relying on open data for population, settlements and road networks, we showed the extent to which scaling relations hold for different boundaries for urban areas, and how they compare to each other. We considered, beside Italian municipalities, urban areas based on the idea of “natural cities”, obtained using head/tail breaks of areas related to human mobility as an explicit indicator of existence of a city. Area-population data for administrative boundaries can be reconciled with scaling relations valid for both the world’s cities data and with those obtained from natural cities, provided an effective area is adopted in place of polygon planimetric area of municipalities. We eventually proposed an aggregation of administrative units using the empirical scaling relation as an objective function for accepting or rejecting pairwise fusion of boundaries. We suggest considering such a method, along with expert considerations, as an additional tool for real-world urban planning as seen from the very general perspective of seemingly abstract scaling laws.}

The constant drive to enable smart applications for them, especially inside public buildings, such as shopping malls, airports, museums, hospitals, etc., warrants a number of location-based services (LBSs) to be available indoors. Even though a plethora of indoor positioning systems have been explored over the years, there is still no de facto standard. For a public building, utilizing the existing communication infrastructure such as Wi-Fi or Bluetooth is more practical, scalable, and cost-effective compared to setting up a completely new infrastructure just for localization purpose. The main challenge of availing LBSs through such systems is the unavailability or inaccessibility of an up-to-date indoor map, especially for a public building. An innovative solution for this issue is to exploit the sensor data of Internet of Things (IoT) devices (e.g., smartphone) carried by the crowd who frequents these premises, and construct the indoor map by processing and fusing the sensor data. In this chapter, a number of existing crowdsourced outdoor/indoor map systems will be touched upon to explore the challenges faced. Considering the fact that the crowdsourced data acquired are from different sensors, and even coming from different persons’ devices, they may be noisy, uncertain, and incomplete. The challenges of processing these data and the subsequent adoption of algorithms to come up with a realistic indoor map are investigated. Finally, a comparative discussion based on the findings is provided by pointing out a few future research directions.}

Spatial value transfer, also known as benefits transfer, is a method to identify the probable locations of ecosystem services based on empirical spatial associations found in other geographic locations. To date, there has been no systematic evaluation of spatial value transfer methods for cultural ecosystem services identified through participatory mapping methods. This research paper addresses this knowledge gap by examining key variables that influence value transfer for cultural ecosystem services: (1) the geographic setting, (2) the type of ecosystem services, and (3) the land cover data selected for value-transfer. Spatial data from public participation GIS (PPGIS) processes in two regions in Norway were used to evaluate spatial value transfer where the actual mapped distribution of cultural ecosystem values were compared to maps generated using value transfer coefficients. Six cultural ecosystem values were evaluated using two different land cover classification systems GlobCover (300m resolution) and CORINE (100m resolution). Value transfer maps based on the distribution of mapped ecosystem values produced strongly correlated results to primary data in both regions. Value transfer for cultural ecosystems appear valid under conditions where the primary data and value transfer regions have similar physical landscapes, the social and cultural values of the human populations are similar, and the primary data sample sizes are large and unbiased. We suggest the use of non-economic value transfer coefficients derived from participatory mapping as the current best approach for estimating the importance and spatial distribution of cultural ecosystem services.}

The implementation of European and national targets for wind energy expansion is, however, challenged by technical, environmental, economic and social acceptance aspects. Further research on wind power expansion is compelled due to dynamic aspects such as land-use fluctuations, evolution of wind turbine technology, associated cost, and other factors. For that reason, a systematic approach for exploring future scenarios of onshore wind power development under techno-economic aspects and quantitative aspects of social acceptance (distributive justice and regulatory framework) was developed. The model was developed in Python, PostgreSQL and SQliteDB and encompasses a high-resolution GIS-based assessment of potential locations for wind turbines. Homogenous input data allows for analysing the wind power potential across Europe. Poland was chosen as a case study to examine the impact of the distance regulation introduced in 2016 and its subsequent amendments, which are relevant for onshore wind power development foreseen in the EU reference scenario 2016 for 2030. The findings show that Poland can reach the target of 10.3 GW set by the EU scenario at Levelized Cost of Electricity below €60/MWh. The transparent modelling framework and findings can support the decision making process on wind energy expansion, which is in the hands of policy makers, private investors and local citizens.}

This paper presents and describes a new polycategorical method that integrates positive aspects of both geographically weighted regression (GWR)-based and quantile regression (QR)-based interpolators for solving areal interpolation problems. Two different types of neighborhoods for selecting observations used to estimate ancillary control densities are presented: one that is spatially based and one that is statistically based. The new polycategorical methods are evaluated against a number of existing methods – areal weighting, pycnophylactic, binary dasymetric, intelligent dasymetric mapping, and GWR using test data from the 2010 census population, the National Land Cover Database 2006 (NLCD2006) and the Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Reference (TIGER) line graph files. The evaluations include several overall error measurement indices as well as maps of the spatial distribution of the error associated with selected methods. Results suggest that with appropriate land cover categories and neighborhoods, the new polycategorical methods provide comparable results to local regression models but with much less computation complexity.}

Using this framework, a model designed to track the spatiotemporal patterns of building evacuations is presented. The model is based upon real-time flood forecast predictions that are linked with building properties to create a model that captures the spatiotemporal ordering of building vulnerabilities and building content evacuations. Applicable to different communities at risk from flooding, the evacuation model is applied to a historical flood for a university campus, demonstrating how the defined elements are used to derive a pattern of vulnerability and evacuation for a campus threatened by severe flooding.}

Although many approaches have been developed in the literature, efficiently modeling the network constraint that objects (e.g. urban facility) are observed on or alongside a street network remains a challenging task for spatial clustering. Based on the techniques of mathematical morphology, this paper presents a new spatial clustering approach NMMSC designed for mining the grouping patterns of network-constrained point objects. NMMSC is essentially a hierarchical clustering approach, and it generally consists of two main steps: first, the original vector data is converted to raster data by utilizing basic linear unit of network as the pixel in network space; second, based on the specified 1-dimensional raster structure, an extended mathematical morphology operator (i.e. dilation) is iteratively performed to identify spatial point agglomerations with hierarchical structure snapped on a network. Compared to existing methods of network-constrained hierarchical clustering, our method is more efficient for cluster similarity computation with linear time complexity. The effectiveness and efficiency of our approach are verified through the experiments with real and synthetic data sets.}

We organize our findings in relation to data collection and data handling, the process of developing smartphone applications, and the ways that outcomes are reported. While the literature is nascent and technological advances are continually opening new opportunities, it is notable that there is limited scholarship that explicitly connects the monitoring function of smartphones to tangible conservation action (e.g., only 10 percent of the papers analysed data collected by smartphones, let alone making connections to required actions or policy). We discuss two central implications in terms of research-implementation spaces for environmental monitoring with smartphones: (1) what we identify as the cost paradox, the lack of recognition of actual costs of app development, monitoring, and implementation; and (2) the need to center the role of people and partnerships in order to ask more precise questions about outcomes for app users and conservation impacts from data collection. We conclude with a call for more research on costs and actual impacts, documentation of factors that lead to successes and failures, and how digital divides influence conservation outcomes. Our intent is not to call into question the potential impacts of smartphone technologies, but to encourage further understanding of how and when they can be most useful.}

In addition, key thematic research lines are identified given the data variables offered by these LBSNs. A comprehensive and descriptive framework for the study of urban phenomena through LBSN data is the main contribution of this study.}

In particular on the Web, it can help to combine spatial data from the variety of existing, but distributed sources, e.g. as provided by Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI). However, standardized spatial data processing on the Web still lacks broad acceptance beyond the scientific domain. This article describes a formalization and service-based implementation of the spatial data fusion process. The formalization builds on a set theoretic description of the considered domain and derives a number of possible fusion objectives. Geoprocessing patterns are used to describe commonly used sub-routines of the fusion process and therefore support the workflow composition. The implementation is based on open standards and comprises a Web-client, several geoprocessing services and a fusion engine to support the Web-based compilation and execution of spatial data fusion workflows in an ad hoc manner.}

It is literally relied upon or responsible for much of what we see and do on a daily basis, with many service systems designed and managed to perform as best as possible. This review paper highlights the increased application of optimization through geographic information systems (GIS) to support management and decision making. A broad perception in management science and optimization circles is that GIS is merely a database system facilitating access to data, mapping and summary analysis. However, optimization is actually available through basic functionality in many GIS packages. This review identifies many of the optimization capabilities available in GIS, and is significant because there is a steady and growing trend of publication in academic and other outlets reporting application efforts that rely on GIS-based optimization. GIS usage is facilitated by user-friendly point-and-click access. This no doubt explains increased management planning involving GIS, making this review important for many reasons. Availability of optimization tools and techniques in GIS translates into use, often by individuals that likely do not understand the underlying models and methods. The growing significance of contemporary GIS software as a management and business analytic medium makes this a timely and important review topic, and suggests that increased interest in the capabilities provided in GIS is essential in order to ensure that optimization methods are appropriately and meaningfully applied in practice.}

A highly relevant phenomenon is therefore the so-called citizen observatories whereby the observations of ordinary citizens, and not just those of professionals and scientists, are included in earth observation and environmental management. Advanced citizen observatories can enable a two-way communication paradigm between citizens and decision makers, potentially resulting in profound changes to local environmental management processes and, as such, in social innovation processes and outcomes. This paper analyses the social innovation potential of such ICT-enabled citizen observatories to increase eParticipation in local flood risk management. The findings from empirical research in two case study locations highlight the divergent roles that authorities conceive for citizens and the role(s) that citizens in practice assign to themselves. Moreover, given the institutional structures identified in these cases and the obligation of authorities to be accountable for their decisions, citizen observatories do not automatically imply that citizens will have a higher level of participation in flood risk management, nor that communication between stakeholders improves.}

The extraction of location information from tweet text is difficult as it contains a lot of non-standard English, grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, non-standard abbreviations, and so on. This research aims to extract location words used in the tweet using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based model. We achieved the exact matching score of 0.929, Hamming loss of 0.002, and F1-score of 0.96 for the tweets related to the earthquake. Our model was able to extract even three- to four-word long location references which is also evident from the exact matching score of over 92%.

Here we present a framework for estimating populations from the bottom up, entirely independently of national census data, a critical need in areas without recent and reliable census data. To make observations of population density, we replace national census data with a microcensus, in which we enumerate population for a sample of small areas within the states of Kano and Kaduna in northern Nigeria. Using supervised texture-based classifiers with very high resolution satellite imagery, we produce a binary map of human settlement at 8-meter resolution across the two states and then a more refined classification consisting of 7 residential types and 1 non-residential type. Using the residential types and a model linking them to the population density observations, we produce population estimates across the two states in a gridded raster format, at approximately 90-meter resolution. We also demonstrate a simulation framework for capturing uncertainty and presenting estimates as prediction intervals for any region of interest of any size and composition within the study region. Used in concert with previously published demographic estimates, our population estimates allowed for predictions of the population under 5 in ten administrative wards that fit strongly with reference data collected during polio vaccination campaigns.}

With a handful of such datasets, their performances and skill in flood exposure assessment have not been explored. This study proposes a comprehensive framework to understand the dynamics and differences in population flood exposure over Canada by employing four global population datasets alongside the census data from Statistics Canada as the reference. The flood exposure is quantified based on a set of floodplain maps (for 2015, 1 in 100-yr and 1 in 200-yr event) for Canada derived from the CaMa-Flood global flood model. To obtain further insights at the regional level, the methodology is implemented over six flood-prone River Basins in Canada. We find that about 9% (3.31 million) and 11% (3.90 million) of the Canadian population resides within 1 in 100-yr and 1 in 200-yr floodplains. We notice an excellent performance of WorldPop, and LandScan in most of the cases, which is unaffected by the representation of flood hazard, while Global Human Settlement and Gridded Population of the World showed large deviations. At last, we determined the long-term dynamics of population flood exposure and vulnerability from 2006 to 2019. Through this analysis, we also identify the regions that contain a significantly larger population exposed to floods. The relevant conclusions derived from the study highlight the need for careful selection of population datasets for preventing further amplification of uncertainties in flood risk. We recommend a detailed assessment of the severely exposed regions by including precise ground-level information. The results derived from this study may be useful not only for flood risk management but also contribute to understanding other disaster impacts on human-environment interrelationships.}

In this paper, we hold a lens over key issues in transitioning to resilience in urban areas by outlining emerging challenges that may offer directions towards operationalising how cities might transition to a more resilient future, while ensuring that communities are at the center of the process. The emerging and challenging areas – geospatial ICT, green infrastructure planning, novel design using collaborative responses, climate planning, limiting urban sprawl and short-circuit economic approaches – are explored as viable facets for devising and sustaining urban transition strategies. We conclude with a discussion on the need for developing a synergistic approach in practice to facilitate transition.}

abstract = {Spring frost is one of the major weather-related threats to winter wheat. The damage to winter wheat caused by spring frost is aggravated by the increase in extreme weather events and the advance of spring phenology driven by a warming climate. Until recently, studies of frost damage were primarily based on controlled field experiments and crop model simulations, which cannot accurately represent the real frost damage suffered by winter wheat in the natural environment. In this study, a remote sensing-based spring frost damage index (SFDI) was proposed to rapidly and effectively quantify the impact of spring frost on winter wheat at the provincial scale. Compared with the existing methods, the SFDI is easy to implement with widely available remotely sensed vegetation index (VI) time-series data. It can be used to assess spring frost damage to winter wheat in near real-time to allow a rapid response. Although the SFDI was developed for winter wheat and spring frost, it has the potential to be extended to other agricultural hazards and crop types through careful adjustments to the design. We assessed the performance of SFDI using a spring frost event that occurred from April 3–7, 2018, in North China as a case study. The results showed that the severely damaged areas were mainly located at the junction of Hebei, Henan, and Shandong provinces, especially in western Shandong Province. The result showed good agreement with the proxy data retrieved from the national archives of regional newspaper reports about the event. The validity of the new index (SFDI) was also verified against the reduction in county-level crop production. Additionally, we used multivariate linear regression (MLR) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) to identify the key factors affecting the spatial variation in SFDI. The results indicated that the growth status of winter wheat before spring frost and the amount of precipitation during the frost event were the two major factors affecting the severity of frost damage to winter wheat, followed by the accumulated frost degree-days and soil moisture. This suggests that proper management of the crop growth rate after winter wheat greening and adequate soil moisture (from irrigation and precipitation) before and during the spring frost period could greatly alleviate the damage of spring frost to winter wheat.}

Integrated geographic modelling and simulation is a computational means to improve understanding of the environment. With the development of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and web technologies, it is possible to conduct open, extensible integrated geographic modelling across a network in which resources can be accessed and integrated, and further distributed geographic simulations can be performed. This open web-distributed modelling and simulation approach is likely to enhance the use of existing resources and can attract diverse participants. With this approach, participants from different physical locations or domains of expertise can perform comprehensive modelling and simulation tasks collaboratively. This paper reviews past integrated modelling and simulation systems, highlighting the associated development challenges when moving to an open web-distributed system. A conceptual framework is proposed to introduce a roadmap from a system design perspective, with potential use cases provided. The four components of this conceptual framework - a set of standards, a resource sharing environment, a collaborative integrated modelling environment, and a distributed simulation environment - are also discussed in detail with the goal of advancing this emerging field.}

It is important to understand Alaskans' perceptions and opinions about energy consumption to solve Alaska's domestic energy problems and creating a sustainable future. However, it is challenging to collect public opinions about energy consumption using conventional survey methods, which are often expensive, labor-intensive, and slow. This study utilizes information-rich Twitter data to investigate Alaskans' perceptions and opinions on various energy sources and in particular clean energy sources. Using the geotagged Twitter data collected in Alaska from 2014 to 2016, a lexicon-based sentiment analysis approach was first applied to analyze the polarity in the expressed opinions. Further, a novel fuzzy-based theory is employed to derive the sentiment of the opinion in each tweet. The results indicate that there is a valuable growth rate for a set of energy-related keywords, such as “sun”, “power”, and “nuclear”. The rank of top 20 renewable energy-related keywords shows the word “Tidal” has the highest ranking followed by “solar panel”. Moreover, the attention to various types of energy is increasing dramatically among Alaskans. Importantly, Alaskans' attitudes toward energy and renewable energy changed positively from 2014 to 2016, indicating that Alaskans' energy choices are more acceptive towards or even favor renewable energy in the future.}

Hence, users' travel tours can help us gain a better understanding about the relationships among different attractions at the city scale. In this paper, a methodological framework is developed to detect tourists' spatial-temporal behaviors from social media data, and then such information is used to extract and analyze city's tourism districts.

This study integrates sensor and positioning technologies and measures the use of green space from an emerging big data perspective. The hourly real-time Tencent user density (RTUD) data from social media are used to analyze the time-spatial distribution of urban park users. RTUD data, park attributes, and surrounding landscape features are incorporated into ArcGIS for spatial analysis. A group of linear regression models is constructed to determine factors that may be associated with the user density of urban parks. The total accumulated number of observed users is 3.25 million in 686 urban parks of Shenzhen in two typical sunny days – a work day and a rest day. Without costly and laborious field investigation, based on RTUD data, we conduct a city wide analysis regarding all parks. The proposed method is proved to be suitable for measuring urban green space use at city-level or even large scale. Results show that park user density is relatively high in well-developed areas and community parks. Park attributes and surrounding landscape features are significantly associated to park use. The findings of this study can help policy makers optimize the construction and maintenance of urban parks.}

abstract = {The reliance of environmental management on comprehensive, high quality, timely and (ideally) affordable data and information has given rise to the need for ‘shared environmental information systems’ (SEIS). Community-based monitoring and information systems or ‘citizen observatories’ are a form of SEIS whereby citizens are involved in new roles such as data collection for environmental monitoring, data and knowledge sharing for joint decision- making, and cooperative planning. Despite the technological advances and the notional potential, many efforts to implement community-based monitoring systems (CBM) are facing difficulties with engaging the core stakeholder. The success of CBMs relies on the active participation and commitment of all involved stakeholders: citizen, decision and policy makers, and (private) data aggregators and scientists. This requires in-depth understanding of their motivations, incentives and barriers for participating. This paper draws on the Theory of Planned Behaviour as an organising theoretical framework and reviews the (dispersed) empirical insights from the literature in order to generate an integrated overview of the incentives and barriers of the aforementioned stakeholders to participate in CBMs. The insights from the literature allow us to take stock of the state of research into motivations for CBM participation, to identify complementary and conflicting incentives for the respective actors, and to indicate gaps to be addressed in future research.}

Most research focuses on the methodology of how to utilize the big data, while the adopted spatial units for data aggregation remain areal in nature. This article conceptually proposes an idea of sensing cities from a street perspective, emphasizes the significance of street units in quantitative urban studies. Using a three-month taxi trajectory dataset and the major streets in Beijing, we explore the spatio-temporal patterns of urban mobility on streets, cluster streets into nine types based on their dynamic functions and capacities. Additionally, we discuss the differences and connections between the linear street unit and traditional areal units, investigate the possibility of uncovering urban communities using streets, and point out the complexity of streets. We conclude that street unit as a supplement to areal units, is able to effectively minify the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP), sense urban dynamics, depict urban functions, and understand urban structures.}

Airborne data acquisition using helicopter and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) helps obtain a bird’s-eye view of disaster-affected areas. However, a major challenge to this approach is robustly processing a large amount of data to identify and map objects of interest on the ground in real-time. The current process is resource-intensive (must be carried out manually) and requires offline computing (through post-processing of aerial videos). This research introduces and evaluates a series of convolutional neural network (CNN) models for ground object detection from aerial views of disaster’s aftermath. These models are capable of recognizing critical ground assets including building roofs (both damaged and undamaged), vehicles, vegetation, debris, and flooded areas. The CNN models are trained on an in-house aerial video dataset (named Volan2018) that is created using web mining techniques. Volan2018 contains eight annotated aerial videos (65,580 frames) collected by drone or helicopter from eight different locations in various hurricanes that struck the United States in 2017–2018. Eight CNN models based on You-Only-Look-Once (YOLO) algorithm are trained by transfer learning, i.e., pre-trained on the COCO/VOC dataset and re-trained on Volan2018 dataset, and achieve 80.69% mAP for high altitude (helicopter footage) and 74.48% for low altitude (drone footage), respectively. This paper also presents a thorough investigation of the effect of camera altitude, data balance, and pre-trained weights on model performance, and finds that models trained and tested on videos taken from similar altitude outperform those trained and tested on videos taken from different altitudes. Moreover, the CNN model pre-trained on the VOC dataset and re-trained on balanced drone video yields the best result in significantly shorter training time.}

This method is based on participatory mapping and qualitative interpretation of positive landscape values (stemming from cultural ecosystem services), negative landscape values (derived from landscape factors that negatively influence social perception), and improvement preferences. It is developed and tested using data collected from 53 interviews with local community members from a highly urbanised stream corridor in the Metropolitan Region of Barcelona (Spain). Intensity score maps of positive/negative landscape values are combined according to their significant spatial co-existence. Conflict index maps are computed for each co-existing pair of positive/negative values, delimiting the areas with the highest index values. Qualitative analysis of the improvement preferences identified within these areas contributed to an understanding of the reasons behind these conflicts. Finally, a weighted linear combination of the positive/negative landscape value intensity maps is applied to identify the areas with the highest level of conflict. Therefore, this approach not only produces a spatial delimitation and prioritization of landscape conflict based on context specific landscape values, but it also characterizes the underlying drivers of conflict on the basis of the qualitative understanding of improvement preferences.}

Such physical workouts are required by a plan, which should be designed and supervised by sport specialists and medical assistants. Thus, the exercise sessions shall start with consultation of a coach, doctor and dietician; however, many times this scenario is not presented. In typical activities such as running, cycling and fitness, people use health mobile apps with their smartphones, which offer support for these activities. Nevertheless, the functionality and operation of these applications are isolated, because many and long questionnaires are performed. Additionally, the physical and health state of a user is not considered. These issues would be taken into account for determining recommendations about the time for doing exercise and the kind of activity for each person. In this work, a social semantic mobile framework to generate recommendations where a mobile application allows sensing the physical performance, taking into consideration medical criteria with smartphones is proposed. The approach includes a semantic cross-information that comes from social network and official data as well as sport activities and medical knowledge. This knowledge is translated into application ontologies related directly to health, nutrition and training domains. The methodology also covers physical fitness tests and a monitoring tool for evaluating the nutrition plan and the correct execution of the training. As case study, the mobile application offers to evaluate the physical and health conditions of a runner, automatically generate a nutrition plan and training, monitor plans and recomputed them if users make changes in their routines. The data provided from the social network are used as feedback in the application, in order to make the training and nutrition plans more flexible by applying spatio-temporal analysis based on machine learning. Finally, the generated training and nutrition plans were validated by specialists, they have demonstrated 82% of effectiveness rate in exercise training routines and 86% in nutrition plans. In addition, the results were compared with isolated approaches and manual recommendations made by specialists, the obtained overall performance was 81%.}

The delineation of zones and related land use ordinances are traditional components of an expert-driven, local government process that produces a general or comprehensive land use plan as required by law. Public participation in the development of general land use plans has rarely used participatory mapping methods that engage the general public to explicitly inform zoning decisions. In this study, we demonstrate how participatory mapping methods can assess the consistency, compatibility, and potential conflict of zoning with public values and preferences in a general plan revision process using a coastal community in California as a case study. We describe the participatory mapping design, data collection, and data analyses in a workflow to illustrate the methods, and present the strengths and limitations of the approach for use in a general land use planning process. Future research should expand these methods to assess the potential effects of resident domicile and “NIMBYism” on the results, and importantly, assess the impact of public participatory mapping in land use decisions if actually implemented by local government authorities.}

Unfortunately, polling units are frequently redrawn, provoking breaks in their data series. Previous electoral results play a key role in many analyses. They are used by political party workers and journalists to present quick assessments of outcomes, by political scientists and electoral geographers to perform detailed scrutinizes and by pollsters and forecasters to anticipate electoral results. In this paper, we study to what extent more complex geographical approaches (based on a proper location of electors on the territory using dasymetric techniques) are of value in comparison to simple methods (like areal weighting) for the problem of reallocating votes in a large, dense city. Barcelona is such a city and, having recently redrawn the boundaries of its census sections, it is an ideal candidate for further scrutiny. Although previous studies show the approaches based on dasymetric techniques outperforming simpler solutions for interpolating census figures, our results show that improvements in the process of reallocating votes are marginal. This brings into question the extra effort that entails introducing ancillary sources of information in a dense urban area for this kind of data. Additional research is required to know whether and when these results are extendable.}

This study focuses on modeling the spatiotemporal patterns of different activity types within cities by employing user-contributed, geosocial content as a proxy for human activities. In this work, we use linguistic topic modeling to analyze georeferenced twitter data in order to differentiate different activity types. We then examine the spatial and temporal patterns of the derived activity types in three U.S. cities: Baltimore, MD., Washington, D.C., and New York City, NY. The linguistic patterns reflect the spatiotemporal context of the places where the social media content is posted. We further construct a method to link what people post online to the activities conducted within a city. We then use these derived activities to profile the characteristics of neighborhoods in the three cities, and apply the activity signatures to discover similar neighborhoods both within and between the cities. This approach represents a novel activity-based method for assessing similarity between neighborhoods.}

This process is central to why academic crowdsourcing has developed in the way it has, and begs the question of how crowdsourcing activities create memory, and what kinds of memory are created. Drawing on existing descriptions of collective and individual memory, this chapter explores further some of the case studies presented earlier in the volume.

This study investigates how the actual provision of cultural services is distributed across the landscape according to spatially varying relationships. The final aim was to analyse how landscape settings are associated to people's preferences and perceptions related to cultural ecosystem services in mountain landscapes. We demonstrated a spatially explicit method based on geo-tagged images from popular social media to assess revealed preferences. A spatially weighted regression showed that specific variables correspond to prominent drivers of cultural ecosystem services at the local scale. The results of this explanatory approach can be used to integrate the cultural service dimension into land planning by taking into account specific benefiting areas and by setting priorities on the ecosystems and landscape characteristics which affect the service supply. We finally concluded that the use of crowdsourced data allows identifying spatial patterns of cultural ecosystem service preferences and their association with landscape settings.}

Considering the fact that the term of seismic resilience can describe the quality of the urban fabrics to respond and recover after occurrence of a seismic event and existence of required infrastructures for effective adaption; enormous efforts have been paid to the quantification and proposal of comprehensive resilience frameworks. Although there are precious achievements in the literature toward the provision of theoretical background for calculation of resilience as a time dependent vulnerability function; the lack of reliable data to verify these models persuade researchers to the application of indicator systems using descriptors to measure different dimensions of resilience. In this paper, a new indicator system is proposed to quantify the seismic resilience in urban areas focusing on the specific challenges to which the developing countries such as Iran are faced. An AHP based approach has been conducted to identify the most important factors that must be included in the model, as well as, their relative contributions through weighting process. The model utilizing 37 indicators, 13 thematic areas and 5 sectors has been developed and examined by implementation in two selected case studies from metropolitan of Tehran and Kish Island in Persian Gulf. The new model has been verified by comparing its ability to reproduce logical quantified resilience values calculated by an already-developed simple model in the literature. The results confirm the potential engagement of quantitative resilience evaluation as a practical step in the context of integrated disaster risk management.}

Although geospatial data producers are striving to define and present data-quality standards to users and users increasingly need to assess the fitness for use of the data, the success of these activities is still far from what is expected or required. As a consequence, neglect or misunderstanding of data quality among users results in misuse or risks. This paper presents an aid in spatio-temporal quality evaluation through the use of spatio-temporal evaluation matrices (STEM) and the index of spatio-temporal anticipations (INSTANT) matrices. With the help of these two simple tools, geospatial data producers can systematically categorize and visualize the granularity of their spatio-temporal data, and users can present their requirements in the same way using business intelligence principles and a Web 2.0 approach.

Furthermore, our analysis suggests that human and remote sensing work well together in detecting the expansion of illegal urban settlements. Looking at the driving factors of illegal settlements, the existence of strong association between the expansion of illegal urban settlements and socioeconomic factors such as unemployment, provides some answers and reveals new questions. Illegal urban growth often leads to the loss of ecological areas in the urban frontiers, especially in areas where the urbanization potential is high. As a consequence, there are conflicts with legal settlers who dislike the illegal expansion. This approach can be extended to and replicated in new urbanizing areas, in particular in Africa and Asia.}

This paper focuses on analysing the governance possibilities of using participative geographic information like volunteered and public participatory geographic information for flood risk reduction in the case of Santiago de Chile, a city which regularly experiences urban floods during rainy seasons. Based on in-depth interviews and document analysis, our study indicates that a relevant part of the current information used for flood risk reduction efforts is provided to local and regional authorities by the affected population. Though, local actors are not recognized by central agencies as valid agents for the production of official information. Moreover, there are neither instances of communication or deliberation with the community, which reduces the capacity of local actors to discuss possible solutions. Participative geographic instruments are seen as potential mechanisms to strengthen work relations among local actors and authorities, by enhancing new logics for producing and sharing information. The impacts for the current risk governance system though can be diverse depending on the participants' level of commitment of participants and the political relations between actors and agencies. Considered as merely data acquisition and analysis mechanisms, participative instruments reproduce the existing hierarchical top-down structures. Furthermore, local-based approaches can enhance local work, support local diagnostics and increase the decision capacity of citizens.}

The public participatory softGIS survey delivers information on the perception of urban green spaces, which we use as a criterion for dividing green space categories in a hedonic pricing model. We find that the perception expressed in the survey is generally consistent with the impact on property prices in the case of formal green spaces. However, it is inconsistent when it comes to informal ones: places identified as lacking well-maintained greenery exert a positive influence on property prices, while positively evaluated informal green spaces had no impact at all. We identify the latter as a typical trade-off between different value perspectives: informal green spaces are perceived differently following a monetary and a non-monetary approach.}

Eight years after the earthquake, the work presented in this paper was used to update the recovery index, not only by measuring the progress of the recovery in L’Aquila but also by validating the usefulness of the proposed recovery index. To achieve this objective, the current research considered the same set of spatial indicators that were used to determine the progress of the recovery in L’Aquila by 2010, 2012, and 2014 in the revaluation of the expert criteria. It was found that in 2016 the number of reconstructed buildings and buildings under ongoing construction had significantly increased and the number of buildings with residential and commercial use had increased along the main roads. While progress was observed in the overall building condition, there was no significant progress in the building use. This poses several questions about how the recovery process can contribute to the return of the inhabitants to the city center of L’Aquila. The paper concludes that the proposed recovery index is useful for identifying the spatial pattern of the recovery process in an urban area affected by an earthquake. At the same time, this recovery index allows the recovery progress to be quantified based on indicators.}

abstract = {Most health-related issues such as public health outbreaks and epidemiological threats are better understood from a spatial–temporal perspective and, clearly demand related geospatial datasets and services so that decision makers may jointly make informed decisions and coordinate response plans. Although current health applications support a kind of geospatial features, these are still disconnected from the wide range of geospatial services and datasets that geospatial information infrastructures may bring into health. In this paper we are questioning the hypothesis whether geospatial information infrastructures, in terms of standards-based geospatial services, technologies, and data models as operational assets already in place, can be exploited by health applications for which the geospatial dimension is of great importance. This may be certainly addressed by defining better collaboration strategies to uncover and promote geospatial assets to the health community. We discuss the value of collaboration, as well as the opportunities that geographic information infrastructures offer to address geospatial challenges in health applications.}

In this context and motivated by the recent ample availability of geospatial data related to urban street networks lately, in this paper we propose an approach that allows to identify how the street network within a given urban area may affect last mile distribution in terms of travel distances, travel times and topography. The approach we have devised is simple, generic and does not depend on field data collection or restricted-access data (such as satellite images, commercial databases, etc.), which can be either too expensive for larger areas or simply unavailable. We also show how maps can be built to represent such measures in an intuitive manner that allows the visual comparison of different areas and cities. Its practical utilization is demonstrated by a case study comprising busy central areas of six large cities in three different continents: Latin America, United States and Europe. The results and insights we present can help different stakeholders, from carriers to local authorities understand the difficulties of a new delivery operation as well as identify more critical areas that may require more attention or some intervention.}

abstract = {The New Human Condition (NHC) is perhaps the largest cognitive challenge in history to human intelligence and agency and concerns our species' ability to cope with the consequences and responsibilities of being the major driver of planetary change in the twenty-first century (Pálsson et al., 2013, Holm et al., 2015). But despite long held assumptions about intra-disciplinary engagements between its “human” and “physical” branches, geography's weakness as a discipline is that it has yet to gather sufficient momentum to collectively shape and implement practical and sustainable climate change policies and actions (Castree, 2014a). However, by considering together the heuristic values of the concepts of the Anthropocene and Planetary Boundaries, the Anglo-American sphere of geography recognizes in either ironic, or unconscious manners that a new strand of environmental determinism (discredited by geographical thought and practice in the early twentieth century) has re-emerged to elide the role of human agency and broadly dominate the discussion of climate change. Mike Hulme (2011, 247) states that “climate determinism” is “a form of analysis and prediction in which climate is first extracted from the matrix of interdependencies that shape human life within the physical world”. Within this discourse it is often the biophysical sphere that is employed to explain the course of human behavior; consequently, this dominating perspective threatens to skew our predictions and understandings of future societies, cultures, climates and destinies. Climate change will certainly constrain human agency, but it also creates the potential for geography to play to its intra and inter disciplinary strengths and begin discussing and addressing human-environmental dilemmas in practical and realistic ways; and secondly, seize the climate change crisis as an opportunity to study where, why and for whom global environmental change matters. Firstly, this paper considers a theoretical balance between the NHC, the Anthropocene and Planetary Boundaries as a way forward for geography to begin addressing the common dilemma of climate change. Within this consideration it engages Anne Buttimer's geographical translation of Martin Heidegger's lebenswelt as a dimension of the NHC. Secondly, the paper discusses how GeoHumanities and GIScience integrations with phenomenology, the digital and environmental humanities and social media generated “Big-Data” can explore the perceptual scales and scopes of the NHC/Anthropocene/Planetary Boundaries conceptual triad. Lastly, it argues that such integrations are salient to the study of emerging Smart City Lifeworlds as a means to engage the increasing urban agencies of global climate change driven by the vagaries of the human condition.}

However, tags are only useful to the extent that they are processable by users and machines, which is often not the case since users frequently provide ambiguous and idiosyncratic tags. Thereby, many social content sites are starting to allow users to enrich their tags with semantic metadata, such as the GeoSocial Content Sites, for example, where users can annotate their tags with geographic metadata. But geographic metadata alone only unveils a very specific facet of a tag, which leads to the need for more general purpose semantic metadata. This paper introduces DYSCS – Do it Yourself Social Content Sites – a platform that combines Web 2.0 and Semantic Web technologies for assisting users in creating their own social content sites enriched with geographic and general purpose semantics. Moreover, DYSCS is highly reusable and interoperable, which are consequences of its ontology driven architecture.}

The spatial properties of these data sources, such as coverage, balance, and completeness, affect the performance of common tasks such as geoparsing and geocoding. However, little attention has focused on how these properties vary in global gazetteers, particularly across country boundaries and according to feature types. In this paper, we present a detailed investigation of the spatial properties of two open gazetteers with worldwide coverage: GeoNames, and the Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names (TGN). Using point density maps, correlations, and linear regressions, we analyze the global spatial coverage of each data source for the full set of features and for top feature types: populated places, streams, mountains, and hills. Results show wide discrepancies in coverage between the two datasets, sharp changes in feature type coverage across country borders, and idiosyncratic patterns dominated by a few countries for the more sparsely covered natural features. As more and more systems rely on recognizing and grounding named places, these patterns can influence the analysis of growing amounts of online text content and reinforce or amplify existing inequalities.}

It is normally difficult to accurately differentiate road from its background due to the complex geometry of the buildings and the acquisition geometry of the sensor. In this paper, we present a new method for extracting roads from high-resolution imagery based on hierarchical graph-based image segmentation. The proposed method consists of: 1. Extracting features (e.g., using Gabor and morphological filtering) to enhance the contrast between road and non-road pixels, 2. Graph-based segmentation consisting of (i) Constructing a graph representation of the image based on initial segmentation and (ii) Hierarchical merging and splitting of image segments based on color and shape features, and 3. Post-processing to remove irregularities in the extracted road segments. Experiments are conducted on three challenging datasets of high-resolution images to demonstrate the proposed method and compare with other similar approaches. The results demonstrate the validity and superior performance of the proposed method for road extraction in urban areas.}

abstract = {Automatic monitoring of changes on the Earth’s surface is an intrinsic capability and simultaneously a persistent methodological challenge in remote sensing, especially regarding imagery with very-high spatial resolution (VHR) and complex urban environments. In order to enable a high level of automatization, the change detection problem is solved in an unsupervised way to alleviate efforts associated with collection of properly encoded prior knowledge. In this context, this paper systematically investigates the nature and effects of class distribution and class imbalance in an unsupervised binary change detection application based on VHR imagery over urban areas. For this purpose, a diagnostic framework for sensitivity analysis of a large range of possible degrees of class imbalance is presented, which is of particular importance with respect to unsupervised approaches where the content of images and thus the occurrence and the distribution of classes are generally unknown a priori. Furthermore, this framework can serve as a general technique to evaluate model transferability in any two-class classification problem. The applied change detection approach is based on object-based difference features calculated from VHR imagery and subsequent unsupervised two-class clustering using k‐means, genetic k-means and self-organizing map (SOM) clustering. The results from two test sites with different structural characteristics of the built environment demonstrated that classification performance is generally worse in imbalanced class distribution settings while best results were reached in balanced or close to balanced situations. Regarding suitable accuracy measures for evaluating model performance in imbalanced settings, this study revealed that the Kappa statistics show significant response to class distribution while the true skill statistic was widely insensitive to imbalanced classes. In general, the genetic k-means clustering algorithm achieved the most robust results with respect to class imbalance while the SOM clustering exhibited a distinct optimization towards a balanced distribution of classes.}

First, we performed a hotspot analysis to ascertain the distribution of tweets in the study area. Then, we employed a count regression model with Twitter message counts by census block group as the dependent variable to test the significance and magnitude of the associations between the built environment and tweeting. After that, we standardized the coefficients to compare the variables’ effects on tweeting. The analysis found that the built environment significantly influenced tweeting and provides empirical statistical evidence to guide urban planners’ placemaking decisions.}

This question fits into broader discussions on how knowledge construction, circulation and utilization can improve competences in local government (efficiency and effectiveness), make urban planning more knowledge-based, and provide greater recognition of citizens’ knowledge (accountability). Local governments need such instruments in dealing with increasing complexity and uncertainty in urban development. We examine how uneven patterns of technological change in using ICT and GIS are transforming current local government work processes in terms of efficiency and effectiveness in their outcomes, utilizing empirical data from extended case studies in six medium-sized cities in India, South Africa, Brazil, and Peru, participating in the Chance2Sustain research network. Knowledge management in cities is configured through several dimensions: 1) discourses for digitizing KM in local urban development; 2) actor networks producing socio-spatial knowledge; 3) embedding KM in decision-making processes (power struggles, exclusion); and 4) influences of KM on work practices and interfaces with citizens. The case study results show that 1) KM discourses concerned four issues: strategic urban planning and integrated land use planning; determining geographic boundaries in urban development discourses; streamlining work processes of local governments, and mapping poverty and needs assessments; 2) initiatives mainly link government with the private sector at various scale levels; 3) codified and technical knowledge remains dominant in discussions on urban development; and 4) effects of KM are uneven, but improve work process efficiency, although the interface with citizens remains limited, focusing on middle-class relations to the exclusion of the poor.}

First, findings from general analysis indicate that (1) the overall growth pattern could be mainly explained by the increasing number of volunteers and their mapping contributions. Second, findings from geometric analysis suggest: (2) mapping intensity exhibits heavy-tailed pattern both for a certain time period and across time; (3) mapping direction moves from outskirts to downtown distinguished from other regions; and (4) mapping behaviors are mainly constrained by the underlying structure of road networks. Third, results of topological analysis indicate that (5) OSM road networks resemble the growth of real road networks and are undergoing an evolution process depicted by exploration and densification. Last, from the perspective of centrality analysis, (6) two kinds of nodes are identified with the ones accounting for the exploration and the other ones for the densification, which further hints the evolution process of continuous strong exploration accompanied by weak densification.}

abstract = {Viewshed analysis is a GIS tool commonly used in a number of research and practical spatial analyses. Input data and their spatial uncertainty are important aspects affecting analysis reliability. Given that inappropriately selected input geodata can produce imprecise visibility models and as a result cause incorrect spatial decisions, quantifying the effect of this uncertainty on resulting visibility models is important for the models' subsequent use. The objective of our study was to evaluate the suitability of digital surface models with varying levels of detail (a LiDAR-based model and models based upon vector data at differing scales) for simple (binary) viewshed analysis of wind turbines (three wind parks each containing 3–6 turbines). Visibility models based upon this input data were compared with actual visibility from 150 control points at random locations. The study results confirmed the prediction that the viewshed model based on more precise input data corresponded more closely to reality. Moreover, our study is the first to demonstrate that only the number of false positives (where the model predicts that an object is visible while in reality it is not) depended on input data precision, while input data did not affect the false negatives. In addition, all vector-based models had far more false positives than false negatives, while the opposite was true for the LiDAR-based model. When we considered the same number of modeled and actually visible wind turbines as a model's matching of reality, there were matches at 83.6–93.7% of control points (95% confidence interval) for the LiDAR-based model. For models based upon vector maps of various scales, the intervals were 68.4–82.2% (1:10,000), 59.1–74.2% (1:25,000), and 48.1–63.9% (1:500,000). We recorded false positives in 6 cases with the LiDAR-based model and 26, 39, and 59 cases, respectively, for vector-based models.}

abstract = {The remarkable growth of wind energy in the last twenty years has been accompanied by a rapid spread of wind turbines (WTs) in many European countries, sometimes creating new landscapes that we are supposed to call “windscapes”. This paper aims to map the EU regions characterized by a very high density of WTs in those ten EU countries, which for various reasons have become key players in the wind energy sector in Europe. We use the crowdsourced data from a participative mapping project, the OpenStreetMap (OSM), created in 2004 in order to build and share online a free editable map of the world. First, we automatically extract the geographical position of each WT, thus creating a GIS of WTs for each of the EU countries under examination. Having certified the reliability of OSM data, we have to estimate the concentration of WTs. For this reason, we assume that the search radius around each windmill corresponds to its visual impact threshold (roughly equal to 10 km). Applying the ‘point density’ function in a GIS environment, we create the map density of WTs in the study area. In order to have a clear visualization of the impact of the wind energy policies adopted by each EU member state, this map is then compared with the map of wind resources created in 1989. What emerges are two very different situations in the study area: while in the north, Germany and Denmark have seen a massive spread of WTs all over their countries, WTs in the south are mainly concentrated in only a few windy areas of Spain, Portugal and Italy. Moreover, almost 1350 Km2 of land distributed in four member states (Germany, Italy, Spain and United Kingdom) can be said to be characterized by a very high density of WTs (over than 200 WTs in a circle area with a radius of 10 Km).}

abstract = {As the basic units of urban areas, functional zones are essential for city planning and management, but functional-zone maps are hardly available in most cities, as traditional urban investigations focus mainly on land-cover objects instead of functional zones. As a result, an automatic/semi-automatic method for mapping urban functional zones is highly required. Hierarchical semantic cognition (HSC) is presented in this study, and serves as a general cognition structure for recognizing urban functional zones. Unlike traditional classification methods, the HSC relies on geographic cognition and considers four semantic layers, i.e., visual features, object categories, spatial object patterns, and zone functions, as well as their hierarchical relations. Here, we used HSC to classify functional zones in Beijing with a very-high-resolution (VHR) satellite image and point-of-interest (POI) data. Experimental results indicate that this method can produce more accurate results than Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) with a larger overall accuracy of 90.8%. Additionally, the contributions of diverse semantic layers are quantified: the object-category layer is the most important and makes 54% contribution to functional-zone classification; while, other semantic layers are less important but their contributions cannot be ignored. Consequently, the presented HSC is effective in classifying urban functional zones, and can further support urban planning and management.}
