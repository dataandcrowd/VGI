Abstract = {{Driven by the recent trends in the GIS domain including Volunteered
   Geographic Information, geo-crowdsourcing and citizen science, and
   fostered by the constant technological advances, collection and
   dissemination of geospatial information by ordinary people has become
   commonplace. However, applications involving user-generated geospatial
   content show dramatically diversified patterns in terms of incentive,
   type and level of participation, purpose of the activity, data/metadata
   provided and data quality. This study contributes to this heterogeneous
   context by investigating public participation in GIS within the field of
   mobile-based applications. Results not only show examples of how to
   technically build GIS applications enabling user collection and
   interaction with geospatial data, but they also draw conclusions about
   the methods and needs of public participation. We describe three
   projects with different scales and purposes in the context of urban
   monitoring and planning, and tourism valorisation. In each case, an open
   source architecture is used, allowing users to exploit their mobile
   devices to collect georeferenced information. This data is then made
   publicly available on specific Web viewers. Analysis of user involvement
   in these projects provides insights related to participation patterns
   which suggests some generalized conclusions. (C) 2015 International

Abstract = {{Using volunteered geographic information (VGI) as a cost-saving
   environmental monitoring and public participation mechanism has been
   thought to be a proof of concept to assist environmental decision-making
   with insufficient managerial resources. However, research literature
   also often found institutional resistance when implementing VGI as part
   of the decision-making process. This research develops a conceptual
   framework as the foundation to conduct a cross-case comparison for four
   empirical cases in recreation and invasive species monitoring, but
   general enough for other such case comparisons. The VGI Reporting
   Assessment Framework (VGI-RAF) adopted aspects of the Decision Situation
   Assessment (DSA) framework as the foundation to address institutional
   flexibility, stakeholder dynamics, and technical considerations. Using a
   cross-case comparison can accumulate deep observations from cases and
   increase validity of insights through comparing processes. Results show
   that eight aspects of the VGI-RAF reveal the suitability of embedding
   voluntary information within existing institutional decision-making
   processes. VGI-RAF depicts considerations for: (1) existing
   participation arrangements, (2) institutional arrangements, (3)
   managers' needs and stakeholder expectation, and (4) interaction
   mechanism and technical needs. The cross-comparison results indicate
   that a public participation mechanism should be accompanied by VGI
   development to increase effectiveness. Institutional arrangements should
   match local government's information needs with participants'
   expectations. Knowledge gaps between institutional information needs and
   volunteer knowledge should be filled through technology enhancements.
   For ease of implementation and to promote long-term success, we
   recommend that volunteered information be connected with existing
   communication channels to minimize changes to existing information
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{Volunteered geographic information (VGI) is the assembly of spatial
   information based on public input. While VGI has proliferated in recent
   years, assessing the quality of volunteer-contributed data has proven
   challenging, leading some to question the efficiency of such programs.
   In this paper, we compare several quality metrics for individual
   volunteers' contributions. The data were the product of the Cropland
   Capture' game, in which several thousand volunteers assessed 165,000
   images for the presence of cropland over the course of 6 months. We
   compared agreement between volunteer ratings and an image's majority
   classification with volunteer self-agreement on repeated images and
   expert evaluations. We also examined the impact of experience and
   learning on performance. Volunteer self-agreement was nearly always
   higher than agreement with majority classifications, and much greater
   than agreement with expert validations although these metrics were all
   positively correlated. Volunteer quality showed a broad trend toward
   improvement with experience, but the highest accuracies were achieved by
   a handful of moderately active contributors, not the most active
   volunteers. Our results emphasize the importance of a universal set of
   expert-validated tasks as a gold standard for evaluating VGI quality.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the usability of Future Internet technologies
   (aka ``Generic Enablers of the Future Internet{''}) in the context of
   environmental applications. The paper incorporates the best aspects of
   the state-of-the-art in environmental informatics with geospatial
   solutions and scalable processing capabilities of Internet-based tools.
   It specifically targets the promotion of the ``Environmental Observation
   Web{''} as an observation-centric paradigm for building the next
   generation of environmental applications. In the Environmental
   Observation Web, the great majority of data are considered as
   observations. These can be generated from sensors (hardware), numerical
   simulations (models), as well as by humans (human sensors).
   Independently from the observation provenance and application scope,
   data can be represented and processed in a standardised way in order to
   understand environmental processes and their interdependencies. The
   development of cross-domain applications is then leveraged by
   technologies such as Cloud Computing, Internet of Things, Big Data
   Processing and Analytics. For example, ``the cloud{''} can satisfy the
   peak-performance needs of applications which may occasionally use large
   amounts of processing power at a fraction of the price of a dedicated
   server farm. The paper also addresses the need for Specific Enablers
   that connect mainstream Future Internet capabilities with sensor and
   geospatial technologies. Main categories of such Specific Enablers are
   described with an overall architectural approach for developing

Abstract = {{With the evolution of geographic information capture and the emergency
   of volunteered geographic information, it is getting more important to
   extract spatial knowledge automatically from large spatial datasets.
   Spatial co-location patterns represent the subsets of spatial features
   whose objects are often located in close geographic proximity. Such
   pattern is one of the most important concepts for geographic context
   awareness of location-based services (LBS). In the literature, most
   existing methods of co-location mining are used for events taking place
   in a homogeneous and isotropic space with distance expressed as
   Euclidean, while the physical movement in LBS is usually constrained by
   a road network. As a result, the interestingness value of co-location
   patterns involving network-constrained events cannot be accurately
   computed. In this paper, we propose a different method for co-location
   mining with network configurations of the geographical space considered.
   First, we define the network model with linear referencing and refine
   the neighborhood of traditional methods using network distances rather
   than Euclidean ones. Then, considering that the co-location mining in
   networks suffers from expensive spatial-join operation, we propose an
   efficient way to find all neighboring object pairs for generating clique
   instances. By comparison with the previous approaches based on Euclidean
   distance, this approach can be applied to accurately calculate the
   probability of occurrence of a spatial co-location on a network. Our
   experimental results from real and synthetic data sets show that the
   proposed approach is efficient and effective in identifying co-location
   patterns which actually rely on a network. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Estimating city evacuation time is a nontrivial problem due to the
   interaction between thousands of individual agents, giving rise to
   various collective phenomena, such as bottleneck formation, intermittent
   flow, and stop-and-go waves. We present a mean field approach to draw
   relationships between road network spatial attributes, the number of
   evacuees, and the resultant evacuation time estimate (ETE). Using
   volunteered geographic information, we divide 50 United Kingdom cities
   into a total of 704 catchment areas (CAs) which we define as an area
   where all agents share the same nearest exit node. 90\% of the agents
   are within approximate to 6,847 m of CA exit nodes with approximate to
   13,778 agents/CA. We establish a characteristic flow rate from catchment
   area attributes (population, distance to exit node, and exit node width)
   and a mean flow rate in a free-flow regime by simulating total
   evacuations using an agent based ``queuing network{''} model. We use
   these variables to determine a relationship between catchment area
   attributes and resultant ETEs. This relationship could enable emergency
   planners to make a rapid appraisal of evacuation strategies and help
   support decisions in the run up to a crisis.}},

Abstract = {{Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) has been widely adopted to

   aimed to develop an effective method to assess the credibility of VGI
   for time-critical conditions, such as disaster response. We collected
   datasets from two extreme flood events in 2011 and 2013 from Brisbane,
   Australia. According to the defined geo-location factors, we built a
   binary logistic regression with the 2011 event dataset to measure the
   credibility scores of the VGI instances. At the threshold of 0.917, the
   overall accuracy of the model in the 2011 training dataset was 90.5\%.
   Next, the performance of this probability model was evaluated by the
   2013 testing instances. We found that our model could categorize the
   credibility classes with 80.4\% accuracy. These results suggest great
   potential for our model to be used by emergency management sectors to
   sort credibility of VGI for efficient and rapid response,

   about the quality of amateur mapping and data efforts are raised in the

   new technology have come out in several recent publications by
   humanitarian actors. Most of these concerns assume that volunteers have
   no professional training related to their work as volunteers. By
   investigating both the volunteers and their organizations, this article
   presents evidence of a more professional cadre of volunteers and a means

Abstract = {{Over the past several years, volunteered geographic information (VGI)

Abstract = {{We explored the potential for rapid land use/land cover (WLC) mapping
   using time-series Landsat satellite imagery and training data (for
   supervised classification) automatically extracted from crowd sourced
   OpenStreetMap (OSM) ``landuse{''} (OSM-LU) and ``natural{''} (OSM-N)
   polygon datasets. The main challenge with using these data for LULC
   classification was their high level of noise, as the Landsat images all
   contained varying degrees of cloud cover (causes of attribute noise) and
   the OSM polygons contained locational errors and class labeling errors
   (causes of class noise). A second challenge arose from the imbalanced
   class distribution in the extracted training data, which occurred due to
   wide discrepancies in the area coverage of each OSM-LU/OSM-N class. To
   address the first challenge, three relatively noise tolerant algorithms
   - naive bayes (NB), decision tree (C4.5 algorithm), and random forest
   (RF) were evaluated for image classification. To address the second
   challenge, artificial training samples were generated for the minority
   classes using the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE).
   Image classification accuracies were calculated for a four-class,
   five-class, and six-class LULC system to assess the capability of the
   proposed methods for mapping relatively broad as well as more detailed
   LULC types, and the highest overall accuracies achieved were 84.0\%
   (four-class SMOTE-RF result), 81.0\% (five-class SMOTE-RF result), and
   72.0\% (six-class SMOTE-NB result). RF and NB had relatively similar
   overall accuracies, while those of C4.5 were much lower. SMOTE led to
   higher classification accuracies for RF and C4.5, and in some cases for
   NB, despite the noise in the training set. The main advantages of the
   proposed methods are their cost- and time-efficiency, as training data
   for supervised classification is automatically extracted from the
   crowdsourced datasets and no pre-processing for cloud detection/cloud
   removal is performed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{As transport systems are pushed to the limits in many cities,
   governments have tried to resolve problems of traffic and congestion by
   increasing capacity. Miller (2013) contends the need to identify new
   capabilities (instead of capacity) of the transport infrastructure in
   order to increase efficiency without extending the physical
   infrastructure. Kenyon and Lyons (2003) identified integrated traveller
   information as a facilitator for better transport decisions. Today, with
   further developments in the use of geographic information systems (GIS)
   and a greater disposition by the public to provide volunteered
   geographic information (VGI), the potential of information is not only
   integrated across modes but also user-generated, real-time and available

   important role in sectors such as politics, businesses and

Abstract = {{As more and more governments share open data, tech developers respond by

   Building on the Johnson and Robinson ( 2014) framework for understanding

   hackathon experience were interviewed about their motivations for and
   benefits derived from participation in these events. Two broad themes
   emerged from these interviews. First, through the development of

   hackathons help put open data into public use. Second, civic hackathons
   provide government staff with valuable feedback about municipal open

Abstract = {{This article describes a Los Angeles-based website that collects
   volunteered geographic information (VGI) on outdoor advertising using
   the Google Street View interface. The Billboard Map website was designed
   to help the city regulate signage. The Los Angeles landscape is thick
   with advertising, and the city efforts to count total of signs has been
   stymied by litigation and political pressure. Because outdoor
   advertising is designed to be seen, the community collectively knows how
   many and where signs exist. As such, outdoor advertising is a perfect
   subject for VGI. This paper analyzes the Los Angeles community's entries
   in the Billboard Map website both quantitatively and qualitatively. I
   find that members of the public are well able to map outdoor
   advertisements, successfully employing the Google Street View interface
   to pinpoint sign locations. However, the community proved unaware of the
   regulatory distinctions between types of signs, mapping many more signs
   than those the city technically designates as billboards. Though these
   findings might suggest spatial data quality issues in the use of VGI for
   municipal record-keeping, I argue that the Billboard Map teaches an
   important lesson about how the public's conceptualization of the urban
   landscape differs from that envisioned by city planners. In particular,
   I argue that community members see the landscape of advertising
   holistically, while city agents treat the landscape as a collection of
   individual categories. This is important because, while Los Angeles
   recently banned new off-site signs, it continues to approve similar
   signs under new planning categories, with more in the works.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we outline the methodological development of current
   research into urban community formations based on combinations of
   qualitative (volunteered) and quantitative (spatial analytical and
   geo-statistical) data. We outline a research design that addresses
   problems of data quality relating to credibility in volunteered
   geographic information (VGI) intended for Web-enabled participatory
   planning. Here we have drawn on a dual notion of credibility in VGI
   data, and propose a methodological workflow to address its criteria. We
   propose a `super-positional' model of urban community formations, and
   report on the combination of quantitative and participatory methods
   employed to underpin its integration. The objective of this
   methodological phase of study is to enhance confidence in the quality of
   data for Web-enabled participatory planning. Our participatory method
   has been supported by rigorous quantification of area characteristics,
   including participant communities' demographic and socio-economic
   contexts. This participatory method provided participants with a ready
   and accessible format for observing and mark-making, which allowed the
   investigators to iterate rapidly a system design based on participants'
   responses to the workshop tasks. Participatory workshops have involved
   secondary school-age children in socio-economically contrasting areas of
   Liverpool (Merseyside, UK), which offers a test-bed for comparing
   communities' formations in comparative contexts, while bringing an
   under-represented section of the population into a planning domain,
   whose experience may stem from public and nonmotorised transport
   modalities. Data has been gathered through one-day participatory
   workshops, featuring questionnaire surveys, local site analysis,
   perception mapping and brief, textual descriptions. This innovative
   approach will support Web-based participation among stakeholding
   planners, who may benefit from well-structured, community-volunteered,

Volume = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Traditional urban planning processes typically happen in offices and
   behind desks. Modern types of civic participation can enhance those
   processes by acquiring citizens' ideas and feedback in participatory
   sensing approaches like ``People as Sensors{''}. As such,
   citizen-centric planning can be achieved by analysing Volunteered
   Geographic Information (VGI) data such as Twitter tweets and posts from
   other social media channels. These user-generated data comprise several
   information dimensions, such as spatial and temporal information, and
   textual content. However, in previous research, these dimensions were
   generally examined separately in single-disciplinary approaches, which
   does not allow for holistic conclusions in urban planning. This paper
   introduces TwEmLab, an interdisciplinary approach towards extracting
   citizens' emotions in different locations within a city. More
   concretely, we analyse tweets in three dimensions (space, time, and
   linguistics), based on similarities between each pair of tweets as
   defined by a specific set of functional relationships in each dimension.
   We use a graph-based semi-supervised learning algorithm to classify the
   data into discrete emotions (happiness, sadness, fear, anger/disgust,
   none). Our proposed solution allows tweets to be classified into emotion
   classes in a multi-parametric approach. Additionally, we created a
   manually annotated gold standard that can be used to evaluate TwEmLab's
   performance. Our experimental results show that we are able to identify
   tweets carrying emotions and that our approach bears extensive potential
   to reveal new insights into citizens' perceptions of the city.}},

Abstract = {{Drawing on John Agnew's (1987) theoretical framework for the analysis of

   (1991) interpretation of Kilburn High Road (London), the contribution
   develops an analysis of the notion of place in the case study of Kilburn

   interpretation of Kilburn High Road in the late Nineties with those from
   a selection of noisy and unstructured volunteered geographic information
   collected from Flickr photos and Tweets harvested in 2014-2015. The
   comparison shows how sense of place is dynamic and changing over time
   and explores Kilburn High Road through the categories of location,
   locale and sense of place derived from the qualitative analysis of VGI
   content and annotations. The contribution shows how VGI can contribute
   to discovering the unique relationship between people and place which
   takes the form given by Doreen Massey to Kilburn High Road and then
   moves on to the many forms given by people experiencing Kilburn High
   Road through a photo, a Tweet or a simple narrative. Finally, the paper

Pages = {{141-154}},
Abstract = {{Volunteered geographic information (VGI), delivered via mobile and web
   apps, offers new potentials for civic engagement. If framed in the
   context of open, transparent and accountable governance then presumably
   VGI should advance dialogue and consultation between citizen and
   government. If governments perceive citizens as consumers of services
   then arguably such democratic intent elide when municipalities use VGI.
   Our empirical research shows how assumptions embedded in VGI drive the
   interaction between citizens and government. We created a typology that
   operationalises VGI as a potential act of citizenship and an instance of
   consumption. We then selected civic apps from Canadian cities that
   appeared to invoke these VGI types. We conducted interviews with
   developers of the apps; they were from government, private sector, and
   civil society. Results from qualitative semi-structured interviews
   indicate a blurring of consumer and citizen-centric orientations among
   respondents, which depended on motivations for data use, engagement and
   communication objectives, and sector of the respondent. Citizen
   engagement, an analogue for citizenship, was interpreted multiple ways.
   Overall, we found that government and developers may increase choice by
   creating consumer-friendly apps but this does not ensure VGI offers an
   act of civic participation. The burden is placed on the contributor to
   make it so. Apps and VGI could potentially further a data-driven and
   neoliberal government. Planners should be mindful of the dominance of a
   consumer-centric view even as they assume VGI invariably improves
   democratic participation.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile sensing of Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) is expanding

   Secure probes exchange data in encrypted form with help from a

Abstract = {{The goal of this study was a better understanding of the quality of
   Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI), and by extension its utility.
   The research focused on the applicability of OpenStreetMap (OSM)
   building data for official spatial databases. In terms of feature
   completeness, the achieved results are in-line with other similar
   studies. The study concluded that in town centres the completeness of
   OSM data is relatively high but decreases further away from urban
   centres. It demonstrated that attribute completeness also relies on the
   level of urbanization as well as the nature of attribute. Furthermore, a
   very high overall positional accuracy was determined for OSM building
   data that ranged between 0.6 m in urban areas and 1.7 m in rural areas.
   This result is more than five times better than the frequently cited OSM
   accuracy results obtained by Haklay in 2010. In this work, a novel tool
   is introduced to help assess the completeness of OSM building-tagged
   features. The proposed index, called the matching feature area-based
   completeness, estimates the completeness of any areal feature set. This
   index is also flexible because it is neither affected by discrepancies
   in the feature outline modelling nor by the degree of abstraction. In
   addition, the author proposed a simple method to update the official
   register using the large volume of OSM building data
   ``over-completeness{''} together with the building data excess

Title = {{VGI for Land Administration: A Quality Perspective}},
Booktitle = {{UNCERTAINTY MODELLING AND QUALITY CONTROL FOR SPATIAL DATA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Pages = {{147-161}},
Abstract = {{The use of volunteered geographic information (VGI) or crowdsourced data
   (Goodchild, 2007) has become a common approach for data collection in
   recent years. This has caused several people to propose the use of VGI
   to collect data for various fields. Success stories were the
   (nongeographic) Wikipedia encyclopedia and OpenStreetMap (OSM). The use
   of VGI in land administration has also been proposed. Robin McLaren
   (2011) proposed crowdsourcing as a way to increase citizen collaboration
   for land administration to enhance transparency at lower costs. Keenja
   et al. (2012) discussed the perception of VGI within the Dutch cadaster.
   Basiouka and Potsiou (2012) even discuss how crowdsourcing can be used
   to identify errors in the Hellenic cadaster. One problem of VGI is
   quality control (compare Goodchild and Li, 2012). Only a small group of
   people can verify the correctness of specific types of information in a
   land administration system. A cadastral boundary line, for example,
   marks the border between two pieces of land (parcels). The correct
   location of the boundary can only be assessed by the owners of these
   parcels or by a surveyor after investigation and measurement. How can
   VGI provide reliable data if the correctness cannot be checked easily?
   Only boundaries between areas of different land use may be visible and
   thus verifiable, but land administration is equally dependent on
   ownership boundaries. In this chapter, we discuss the types of data used
   in land administration as defined by Dale and McLaughlin ( 1999). These
   categories are then analyzed to identify the areas where VGI can
   actually provide reliable input. Such an analysis shows how to use the
   methodology of crowdsourcing for land administration and clarifies the
   limits of such use.}},

Pages = {{64-77}},
Abstract = {{In this work, we present a routing approach avoiding relatively
   dangerous areas within a city. The information of how dangerous some
   urban areas are is derived using volunteered geographic information
   (VGI), governmental open data for detecting properties and
   functionalities of the urban infrastructure and historical crime data
   from police departments for detecting crime hot spots. Therefore, we
   present the basics of crime mapping and analysis with GIS, the practical
   use of VGI for routing and describe our contribution within the field of
   routing solutions. Afterwards, we explore our test data in detail. For
   the practical use, we simplify all the urban infrastructure information
   and propose a safety index, which represents the relative safety in the
   investigation area. Additionally, historical crime hot spots are
   detected and used as routing obstacles. The arcs in the road network are
   weighted by our safety index and the historical crime hot spots are
   introduced as obstacle polygons. We test our safety-aware routing design
   on Los Angeles (LA) and assume its use during night times. In this
   regard, from two relatively far away situated origin and destination
   points, we calculate the least dangerous path and compare it with the
   calculated shortest path. Vehicle drivers without knowledge about the
   dangerous areas in the city may use the least dangerous path, which is
   based on our calculated safety index. Finally, we discuss the
   effectiveness of our method and consider further extensions using freely
   available geodata.}},

Abstract = {{The emerging ubiquity of geospatial information is providing an
   unprecedented opportunity to apply Geographical Information Systems
   (GIS)-based multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to a broad
   spectrum of use cases. Volunteered geographic information, open GIS
   software, geoservice-based tools, cloud-based virtualized platforms, and
   worldwide collaboration of both domain experts and general users have
   greatly increased the quantity and accessibility of geospatially

   tools that integrate this decision-driven process within a widely
   accessible, robust geoframework environment, designed for user-friendly

   Analysis and Reasoning (GEAR), which provides a viable transition path
   to enhance geospatial MCDA in the age of open GIS. We propose a
   Web-based platform that leverages open-source geotechnologies to
   incorporate a wide variety of geospatial data formats in a common
   solution space to allow for spatially enhanced and time-relevant
   decision analysis. Through the proposed workflow, a user can ingest and
   modify heterogeneous data formats, exploit temporally tagged data
   sources, create multicriteria decision analysis models, and visualize
   the results in an iterative and collaborative workspace. A sample case
   study applied to disaster relief is used to demonstrate the prototype

Abstract = {{Current implementations of gazetteers, geographic directories that
   associate place names to geographic coordinates, cannot use semantics to
   answer complex queries (most gazetteers are just thesauri of place
   names), use domain ontologies for place name disambiguation, make their
   data sets available in the Semantic Web or support the use of
   Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI). A new generation of gazetteers
   has to tackle these problems. In this paper, we present a new
   architecture for gazetteers that uses VGI and Semantic Web tools, such
   as ontologies and Linked Open Data to overcome these limitations. We
   also present a gazetteer, the Semantic Web Interactive Gazetteer (SWI),
   implemented using this architecture, and show that it can be used to add
   absent geographic coordinates to biodiversity records. In our tests, we
   use this gazetteer to correct geographic data from a big sample (around
   142,000 occurrence records of Amazonian specimens) from SpeciesLink, a
   big repository of biodiversity collection records from Brazil. The tests
   showed that the SWI Gazetteer was able to add geographic coordinates to
   around 30,000 records, increasing the records with coordinates from
   30.29\% to 57.5\% of the total number of records in the sample
   (representing an increase of 90\%). (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The endemic Azores Bullfinch or Priolo (Pyrrhula murina) is one of the
   most threatened European passerines, historically restricted to a single
   population in the Pico da Vara/Ribeira do Guilherme Special Protection
   Area (Sao Miguel Island, Azores, Portugal). Annual census of this
   species started in 1991. It usually took one observer 1-2 months to
   complete the census and even then, it was not logistically reasonable to
   include some areas with very steep slope in the core of the protected
   area. In order to bypass these constraints, an alternative and ambitious
   monitoring scheme that would allow estimating the whole species
   throughout its entire range was proposed in 2007. The new scheme, which
   complemented and improved previous estimates, consisted in performing a
   thorough instantaneous census using a distance sampling approach, thus
   allowing a detailed snapshot of effective occupation, density, habitat
   preferences and distribution range of the Azores Bullfinch. The Priolo
   Atlas turned into a volunteered geographic information and citizen
   science-based ornithological initiative which every 4 years congregates
   more than 50 well-trained volunteers in the Azores. With the first two
   editions (2008 and 2012), this initiative has already established itself
   as a critical tool to monitor the population of this endemic species.

Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{Within ecological research and environmental management, there is
   currently a focus on demonstrating the links between human well-being
   and wildlife conservation. Within this framework, there is a clear
   interest in better understanding how and why people value certain places
   over others. We introduce a new method that measures cultural
   preferences by exploring the potential of multiple online georeferenced
   digital photograph collections. Using ecological and social
   considerations, our study contributes to the detection of places that
   provide cultural ecosystem services. The degree of appreciation of a
   specific place is derived from the number of people taking and sharing
   pictures of it. The sequence of decisions and actions taken to share a
   digital picture of a given place includes the effort to travel to the
   place, the willingness to take a picture, the decision to geolocate the
   picture, and the action of sharing it through the Internet. Hence, the
   social activity of sharing pictures leaves digital proxies of spatial
   preferences, with people sharing specific photos considering the
   depicted place not only ``worth visiting{''} but also ``worth sharing
   visually.{''} Using South Wales as a case study, we demonstrate how the
   proposed methodology can help identify key geographic features of high
   cultural value. These results highlight how the inclusion of
   geographical user-generated content, also known as volunteered
   geographic information, can be very effective in addressing some of the
   current priorities in conservation. Indeed, the detection of the most
   appreciated nonurban areas could be used for better prioritization,
   planning, and management.}},

Abstract = {{With the prevalence of smartphones, new ways of engaging citizens and
   stakeholders in urban planning and governance are emerging. The
   technologies in smartphones allow citizens to act as sensors of their
   environment, producing and sharing rich spatial data useful for new
   types of collaborative governance set-ups. Data derived from Volunteered
   Geographic Information (VGI) can support accessible, transparent,
   democratic, inclusive, and locally-based governance situations of
   interest to planners, citizens, politicians, and scientists. However,
   there are still uncertainties about how to actually conduct this in
   practice. This study explores how social media VGI can be used to
   document spatial tendencies regarding citizens' uses and perceptions of
   urban nature with relevance for urban green space governance. Via the
   hashtag \#sharingcph, created by the City of Copenhagen in 2014, VGI
   data consisting of geo-referenced images were collected from Instagram,
   categorised according to their content and analysed according to their
   spatial distribution patterns. The results show specific spatial

   much potential of using VGI for generating, sharing, visualising and
   communicating knowledge about citizens' spatial uses and preferences
   exist, but as a tool to support scientific and democratic interaction,
   VGI data is challenged by practical, technical and ethical concerns.
   More research is needed in order to better understand the usefulness and

Abstract = {{City governments around the world are developing and expanding how they
   connect to citizens. Technologies play an important role in making this
   connection, and one frequent way that cities connect with citizens is
   through 311-style request systems. 311 is a non-emergency municipal
   notification system that uses telephone, email, web forms, and

   of infrastructure issues and make requests for municipal services. In
   many ways, this process of citizen contribution mirrors the provision of

   generated content. This research presents a case study of the city of
   Edmonton, Canada, an early adopter of multi-channel 311 service request
   systems, including telephone, email, web form, and mobile app 311
   request channels. Three methods of analysis are used to characterize and
   compare these different channels over three years of request data; a
   comparison of relative request share for each channel, a spatial hot
   spot analysis, and regression models to compare channel usage with
   sociodemographic variables. The results of this study indicate a shift
   in channel usage from traditional to Internet-enabled, that this shift
   is mirrored in the hotspots of request activity, and that specific
   digital inequalities exist that reinforce this distinction between

Journal = {{URBAN PLANNING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{32-48}},
Abstract = {{High density residential development in metropolitan Melbourne, where
   contradictory imperatives of neighbourhood character and urban
   intensification play important roles, remains an uncertain practice. One
   key issue for plan implementation is the lack of consistency between
   authorities, developers and the community in interpreting the standards,
   design guidelines, and state/local strategies, especially those relating
   to neighbourhood character. There is currently no mechanism to
   incorporate community perceptions and place experiences as subjective
   aspects of neighbourhood character in development assessments. There is
   also little use of micro-scale and multi-dimensional spatial analysis to
   integrate these subjective aspects with objective measures (e.g.
   building volume and height; streetscape) to communicate effectively-and
   in a limited timeframe-with all stakeholders. This paper explores the
   potential of two emerging geospatial technologies that can be leveraged
   to respond to these problems. Evidence in the literature suggests that
   volunteered geographic information (VGI) can provide community input
   around subjective aspects of the urban environment. In addition, a
   deluge of three-dimensional (3D) spatial information (e.g. 3D city
   models) is increasingly available for micro-level (building-or
   property-level) assessment of the physical aspects of the urban
   environment. This paper formulates and discusses a conceptual framework
   to link these two spatial technological advancements in a virtual
   geographic environment (VGE) that accounts for micro-scale 3D spatial
   analysis incorporating both subjective and objective aspects of
   neighbourhood character relevant in implementing compact city
   strategies.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an original approach to dynamic anomalous behavior
   detection in individual trajectory using a recursive Bayesian filter.
   The anomalous pattern detection is of great interest for navigation,
   driver assistance systems, surveillance as well as crisis management. In
   this work, we focus on the GPS trajectories of automobiles finding where
   the driver's behavior shows anomalies. Such anomalous behaviors can
   happen in many cases, especially when the driver encounters orientation
   problems, i.e., taking a wrong turn, performing a detour, or losing the
   way. First, three high-level features, i.e., turns and their density,
   detour factor, and route repetition are extracted from the given
   trajectory geometry, for which a long-term perspective is required to
   observe data sequences of a significant length instead of individual
   time stamps. We therefore employ high-order Markov chains with a dynamic
   memory' to model the trajectory integrating these long-term features.
   The Markov model is processed by a proposed recursive Bayesian filter to
   infer an optimal probability distribution of the potential anomalous
   driving behaviors dynamically over time. The filter performs
   unsupervised detection in single trajectories based on local features
   only. No training process is required to characterize the anomalous
   behaviors. By analyzing the detection results of individual
   trajectories, collective behaviors can be derived indicating traffic
   issues such as congestions and turn restrictions. Experiments are
   performed on volunteered geographic information (VGI) data,
   self-acquired trajectories, and open trajectory datasets to demonstrate
   the potential of the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{In crowdsourced cartographic projects, mappers coordinate their efforts
   through online tools to produce digital geospatial artefacts, such as
   maps and gazetteers, which were once the exclusive territory of
   professional surveyors and cartographers. In order to produce meaningful
   and coherent data, contributors need to negotiate a shared
   conceptualisation that defines the domain concepts, such as road,
   building, train station, forest and lake, enabling the communication of
   geographic knowledge. Considering the OpenStreetMap Wiki website as a
   case study, this article investigates the nature of this negotiation,
   driven by a small group of mappers in a context of high contribution
   inequality. Despite the apparent consensus on the conceptualisation, the
   negotiation keeps unfolding in a tension between alternative
   representations, which are often incommensurable, i.e., hard to
   integrate and reconcile. In this study, we identify six complementary
   dimensions of incommensurability that recur in the negotiation: (1)
   ontology, (2) cartography, (3) culture and language, (4) lexical
   definitions, (5) granularity, and (6) semantic overload and duplication.}},

Abstract = {{OpenStreetMap (OSM) represents one of the most well-known examples of a
   collaborative mapping project. Major research efforts have so far dealt
   with data quality analysis but the modality of OSM's evolution across
   space and time has barely been noted. This study aims to analyze
   spatio-temporal patterns of contributions in OSM by proposing a
   contribution index (CI) in order to investigate the dynamism of OSM. The
   CI is based on a per cell analysis of the node quantity, interactivity,
   semantics, and attractivity (the ability to attract contributors).
   Additionally this research explores whether OSM has been constantly
   attracting new users and contributions or if OSM has experienced a
   decline in its ability to attract continued contributions. Using the
   Stuttgart region of Germany as a case study the empirical findings of
   the CI over time confirm that since 2007, OSM has been constantly
   attracting new users, who create new features, edit the existing spatial
   objects, and enrich them with attributes. This rate has been
   dramatically growing since 2011. The utilization of a Cellular
   Automata-Markov (CA-Markov) model provides evidence that by the end of
   2016 and 2020, the rise of CI will spread out over the study area and
   only a few cells without OSM features will remain.}},

Abstract = {{Our lives are affected by myriads of events happening daily all over the
   world. For efficient planning and management of complex systems composed
   of various components, understanding relationships between an event and
   the reactive behaviour of involved components is vital. Analysing these
   complex relations demands a spatiotemporal event-based model, in which
   the event plays a central role. In this article we develop a framework
   which provides the possibility of mapping and storing event-related
   information on the OpenStreetMap (OSM) platform by volunteers. The study
   is divided into two different phases: first, mapping the event elements
   by adding new attributes adequately designed to encode spatiotemporal
   and semantic event information; and, second, representing the
   event-related information on a map by developing a Web application,
   offering a volunteered location-based service. To facilitate the
   event-mapping procedure, a Java OpenStreetMap (JOSM) plug-in was
   developed for volunteers. The plug-in was developed based on the notion
   of an event to adequately store and manipulate the semantic information
   of events in the OSM structure. The tool was used by more than 100
   volunteers in Munich for the years 2012 to 2014. In addition to manual
   collection of event-related information by volunteers, a crawling
   framework was also developed to automatically collect freely available
   event information from various Web pages on the Internet. The framework
   extracts the same event elements as the plug-in. But the framework
   crawls each Web page according to some pre-defined rules and follows a
   post-processing step, if necessary. The manually collected events along
   with the crawled event information are visualized in a Web application.
   The study revealed that adding the possibility of event-oriented mapping
   to OSM empowers volunteers to collect a higher level of information
   (event information) for city maps. This information can furthermore be
   used for strategy development and service planning by decision-makers.}},

Abstract = {{OpenStreetMap is a geographic information platform designed to provide
   real-time updates and user-generated content related to its freely
   available global map, and it is one of the most widely used examples of
   volunteered geographic information, a technique associated with
   so-called neogeography. This paper, based on the data from Chinas
   OpenStreetMap road network in May 2014, taking 340 prefecture-level
   cities in China as its study area, presents the geometric-related (road
   density) and attribute-related (type diversity) spatial patterns of the
   OpenStreetMap road network, and explores their relationship. The results
   are as follows. (1) The distribution of OpenStreetMap road density in
   Shenzhen, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Macao predominantly obeys a positive
   skewness distribution. OpenStreetMap data for eastern China shows a
   higher overall and circular structure. In central China, there are
   noticeable discrepancies in the road density, whereas in western China,
   the road density is low. (2) The OpenStreetMap road diversity shows a
   normal distribution. The spatial pattern for the so-called Hu Huanyong
   line was broken by the effect of diplomatic and strategic factors,
   showing a high diversity along the peripheral border, coastal cities,
   and core inland cites. (3) Chinas OpenStreetMap is partitioned into four
   parts according to road density and diversity: high density and high
   diversity; low density and low diversity; high density and low
   diversity; and low density high diversity. (4) The OpenStreetMap
   geographical information-collection process and mechanism were analyzed,
   demonstrating that the road density reflects the preponderance of
   traffic in the real world. OpenStreetMap road diversity reflects the
   road-related geographic information demand and value, and it also
   reflects the interests of users toward to OpenStreetMap geographical
   information. (C) 2015 The Authors. Production and Hosting by Elsevier

Abstract = {{OpenStreetMap (OSM) has seen an exponential increase in the last few

   high rate of overnight stays, high number of foreigners, and residents
   aged from 18 to 69 are more likely to be involved in OSM. Furthermore,

Abstract = {{Crowdsourcing is a popular means of acquiring data, but the use of such

   cartography and geographical sciences more generally, with the quality
   of volunteered geographic information (VGI) recognized as a major
   challenge to address if the full potential of citizen sensing in mapping
   applications is to be realized. Here, a means to characterize the
   quality of volunteers, based only on the data they contribute, was used
   to explore issues connected with the quantity and quality of volunteers
   for attribute mapping. The focus was on data in the form of annotations
   or class labels provided by volunteers who visually interpreted an
   attribute, land cover, from a series of satellite sensor images. A
   latent class model was found to be able to provide accurate
   characterizations of the quality of volunteers in terms of the accuracy
   of their labelling, irrespective of the number of cases that they
   labelled. The accuracy with which a volunteer could be characterized
   tended to increase with the number of volunteers contributing but was
   typically good at all but small numbers of volunteers. Moreover, the
   ability to characterize volunteers in terms of the quality of their
   labelling could be used constructively. For example, volunteers could be
   ranked in terms of quality which could then be used to select a sub-set
   as input to a subsequent mapping task. This was particularly important
   as an identified subset of volunteers could undertake a task more
   accurately than when part of a larger group of volunteers. The results
   highlight that both the quantity and quality of volunteers need
   consideration and that the use of VGI may be enhanced through
   information on the quality of the volunteers derived entirely from the

Abstract = {{Recent improvements in online information communication and mobile
   location-aware technologies have led to the production of large volumes
   of volunteered geographic information. Widespread, large-scale efforts
   by volunteers to collect data can inform and drive scientific advances
   in diverse fields, including ecology and climatology. Traditional
   workflows to check the quality of such volunteered information can be
   costly and time consuming as they heavily rely on human interventions.
   However, identifying factors that can influence data quality, such as
   inconsistency, is crucial when these data are used in modeling and
   decision- making frameworks. Recently developed workflows use simple
   statistical approaches that assume that the majority of the information
   is consistent. However, this assumption is not generalizable, and
   ignores underlying geographic and environmental contextual variability
   that may explain apparent inconsistencies. Here we describe an automated
   workflow to check inconsistency based on the availability of contextual
   environmental information for sampling locations. The workflow consists
   of three steps: (1) dimensionality reduction to facilitate further
   analysis and interpretation of results, (2) model-based clustering to
   group observations according to their contextual conditions, and (3)
   identification of inconsistent observations within each cluster. The
   workflow was applied to volunteered observations of flowering in common
   and cloned lilac plants (Syringa vulgaris and Syringa x chinensis) in
   the United States for the period 1980 to 2013. About 97\% of the
   observations for both common and cloned lilacs were flagged as
   consistent, indicating that volunteers provided reliable information for
   this case study. Relative to the original dataset, the exclusion of
   inconsistent observations changed the apparent rate of change in lilac
   bloom dates by two days per decade, indicating the importance of
   inconsistency checking as a key step in data quality assessment for
   volunteered geographic information. Initiatives that leverage
   volunteered geographic information can adapt this workflow to improve
   the quality of their datasets and the robustness of their scientific
   analyses.}},

Abstract = {{The vast accumulation of environmental data and the rapid development of
   geospatial visualization and analytical techniques make it possible for
   scientists to solicit information from local citizens to map spatial
   variation of geographic phenomena. However, data provided by citizens
   (referred to as citizen data in this article) suffer two limitations for
   mapping: bias in spatial coverage and imprecision in spatial location.
   This article presents an approach to minimizing the impacts of these two
   limitations of citizen data using geospatial analysis techniques. The
   approach reduces location imprecision by adopting a frequency-sampling
   strategy to identify representative presence locations from areas over
   which citizens observed the geographic phenomenon. The approach
   compensates for the spatial bias by weighting presence locations with
   cumulative visibility (the frequency at which a given location can be
   seen by local citizens). As a case study to demonstrate the principle,
   this approach was applied to map the habitat suitability of the
   black-and-white snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus bieti) in Yunnan,
   China. Sightings of R. bieti were elicited from local citizens using a
   geovisualization platform and then processed with the proposed approach
   to predict a habitat suitability map. Presence locations of R. bieti
   recorded by biologists through intensive field tracking were used to
   validate the predicted habitat suitability map. Validation showed that
   the continuous Boyce index (B-cont(0.1)) calculated on the suitability
   map was 0.873 (95\% CI: {[}0.810, 0.917]), indicating that the map was
   highly consistent with the field-observed distribution of R. bieti.
   B-cont(0.1) was much lower (0.173) for the suitability map predicted
   based on citizen data when location imprecision was not reduced and even
   lower (-0.048) when there was no compensation for spatial bias. This
   indicates that the proposed approach effectively minimized the impacts
   of location imprecision and spatial bias in citizen data and therefore
   effectively improved the quality of mapped spatial variation using
   citizen data. It further implies that, with the application of
   geospatial analysis techniques to properly account for limitations in
   citizen data, valuable information embedded in such data can be
   extracted and used for scientific mapping.}},

   geolocalization of user-generated photographs and videos, one must first
   populate a geographic database with the different types of objects and

   Toward that end, this paper presents a framework for detecting and
   labeling objects in satellite imagery. The objects that we are
   interested in are characterized by low-level features that exist mostly
   at or beyond the limits of spatial resolution in the satellite images.
   To deal with the challenges posed by the extraction of such features
   from satellite imagery, we confine our search to the vicinity of the
   OpenStreetMap (OSM) delineated roads in a geographic area. The OSM roads
   are projected into the satellite images through inverse
   orthorectification. As an illustration of the performance of the object
   detection framework presented in this paper, our system can detect
   pedestrian cross-walks in a 200 000 sq. km. region of Australia (that is
   covered by 222 satellite images) with a recall rate of 63\% and a

Abstract = {{The exponential adoption of smartphones affords the general public
   access to tools (sensors) that were once only available to highly
   trained scientists and geospatial technicians. This provides more people
   with opportunities to contribute and consume information relevant to
   their current location. Geographers have been applying critical theory
   to examine privacy implications associated with constant locational
   aware smartphone usage while applied researchers are measuring spatial
   cognitive abilities using empirically bound approaches. What remains
   unknown is how smartphone users perceive implications associated with
   privacy and spatial cognitive abilities as a result of smartphone use
   for location based queries. An online survey was administered to collect
   perceptions related to these issues from the general smartphone-using
   public. It was found that while participants were mindful of privacy
   concerns associated with smartphone use, they reported that perceived
   benefits of smartphone use outweigh associated costs. Additionally, the
   majority of the participants found that their smartphones provided them
   with confidence in way-finding tasks rather than hindering them as some
   literature suggests. Through this study we aim to describe how a lack of
   understanding of the general publics' perceptions of smartphone usage
   may be limiting contemporary theory and practice within volunteered
   geographic information and location based services related research
   associated with geography.}},

Pages = {{187-197}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, we have seen the emergence of sound mapping, through
   which users can share their recordings of sounds via online mapping
   platforms. These practices are enabled by an array of spatial and
   digital technologies that also facilitate the growth of the so-called
   volunteered geographic information (VGI) regarding contributions from
   users without training in conventional GIS or cartography. In the
   growing body of work on VGI, however, not much attention has been given
   to the emergence of such sound maps as part of the VGI constructions.
   Meanwhile, research in soundscape has not addressed the aspect of
   crowd-sourcing or user-generated contributions facilitated by new
   information and communication technologies. This article seeks to bridge
   this gap. It draws upon important insights from critical GIS research
   into investigating VGI as visual practices, while it is also informed by
   three areas of soundscape research including mapping soundscapes,
   tracing the production of soundscapes and exploring embodied experiences
   with soundscapes. Through an empirical case in China, this article
   suggests a two-level analytical framework: investigating in what ways
   crowd-sourced sound maps emerge and interpreting these sounds on their
   shared platforms. In so doing, this study calls for more engagement with
   the multi-modality aspect of visuality in mappings, which in turn may
   have implications for landscape design and planning. In this way, it
   seeks to enrich the discussion on critical visualization. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Main road features extracted from remotely sensed imagery play an
   important role in many civilian and military applications, such as

   extracting main roads from high-resolution grayscale imagery based on
   directional mathematical morphology and prior knowledge obtained from
   the Volunteered Geographic Information found in the OpenStreetMap. The
   two salient steps in this strategy are: (1) using directional
   mathematical morphology to enhance the contrast between roads and
   non-roads; (2) using OpenStreetMap roads as prior knowledge to segment
   the remotely sensed imagery. Experiments were conducted on two ZiYuan-3
   images and one QuickBird high-resolution grayscale image to compare our
   proposed method to other commonly used techniques for road feature
   extraction. The results demonstrated the validity and better performance

Abstract = {{Tornadoes have the potential to cause significant destruction and loss
   of life in many regions across Canada. Accordingly, these hazards are
   essential to consider for a comprehensive emergency management plan.
   Following a suspected tornadic event, damage surveys are conducted by
   Environment Canada to determine the extent and severity of damage in
   order to assign an Enhanced Fujita scale rating. The purpose of this
   paper is to investigate the process involved in conducting storm damage
   surveys, and to assess how information gathered during these surveys is
   used. Primary research for this study involved conducting
   semi-structured interviews with Environment Canada damage surveyors from
   various provinces (n=10) and wind engineering researchers from a large
   public university in Canada (n = 2), as well as an onsite observation of
   a damage survey conducted in Angus, Ontario after a tornado struck on 17
   June 2014. The results of this study underscored the subtle but
   important differences between storm damage surveys conducted in the
   United States and Canada. It was also found that the majority of damage
   surveys are now conducted remotely through photos, videos, and telephone
   interviews with key witnesses. Finally, damage surveys were found to be
   a critical component of the disaster management cycle by contributing to
   both risk reduction and preparedness. Introducing sophisticated
   technologies such as mobile devices and applications, as well as using
   volunteered geographic information to display damage reports on a

Abstract = {{Small-scale data on dwellings and population density are required for
   precise geospatial urban modelling. Further, knowledge of building usage
   is necessary to model socio-economic aspects such as the distribution of
   dwellings and population. In an effort to limit costs and resourcing
   efforts, users and institutes in research and spatial planning are
   developing strategies to extract such information from existing
   geographic base data. Currently, land-use information from official
   datasets merely distinguishes residential from non-residential building
   usage, but cannot identify areas of non-residential usage inside
   residential buildings. Additional data sources are therefore needed to
   fill this gap. In this paper we propose an approach to process semantic
   information from user-generated OpenStreetMap (OSM) data to specify
   non-residential usage in residential buildings. This estimation is based
   on OSM attributes, so-called tags, which are used to define the extent
   of non-residential usage. Our objective is to identify the potentials
   and reveal the limitations of integrating semantic OSM data for the
   evaluation of building usage. Official statistical data on dwellings and
   population is used to validate results. Thereby we prove the benefit of
   integrating OpenStreetMap semantic data to refine the estimation of
   non-residential floor area in the study area of the German City of

Abstract = {{User-generated content (UGC) that contains spatial references, often

   one increasingly prevalent source of these data, geographically encoded
   photographs, to capture spatial expressions of place in an urban
   environment. Geotagged photographs were obtained from the Flickr API to
   build a geographic database of photographs for the city of Vancouver,
   Canada from 2001-2012. These data were aggregated to multiple geographic
   units represented as hexagonal lattices. Spatial patterns of photo
   aggregation were examined for tessellations that ranged from 0.25 ha to
   1024 ha. Tags associated with each photo were also explored through the
   notion of `tag-space' at multiple resolutions, or ``scales{''}, of
   analysis through local log-odds ratios. Results indicate a significant
   interaction between tag-space semantics and spatial aggregation which
   suggests that consideration of scale effects should be integral to
   analysis of this type of tagged VGI for exploring citizens' sensing of
   urban environments. The results indicate further that we may have to
   reconsider the interaction between encoded meaning, the methods used for
   extracting such meaning from tag-space, and exogenous and endogenous

Abstract = {{Geotagged photos on social media like Flickr explicitly indicate the
   trajectories of tourists. They can be employed to reveal the tourists'
   preference on landmarks and routings of tourism. Most of existing works
   on routing searches are based on the trajectories of GPS-enabled
   devices' users. From a distinct point of view, we attempt to propose a
   novel approach in which the basic unit of routing is separate road
   segment instead of GPS trajectory segment. In this paper, we build a
   recommendation system that provides users with the most popular
   landmarks as well as the best travel routings between the landmarks. By
   using Flickr geotaggged photos, the top ranking travel destinations in a
   city can be identified and then the best travel routes between the
   popular travel destinations are recommended. We apply a spatial
   clustering method to identify the main travel landmarks and subsequently
   rank these landmarks. Using machine learning method, we calculate the
   tourism popularity of the road in terms of relevant parameters, e.g.,
   the number of users and the number of Point-of-Interests. These
   popularity assessments are integrated into the routing recommendation
   system. The routing recommendation system takes into consideration both
   the popularity assessment and the length of the road. The best route
   recommended to the user minimizes the distance while including maximal
   tourism popularity. Experiments were conducted in two different
   scenarios. The empirical results show that the recommendation system is
   able to provide the user good travel planning including both top ranking
   landmarks and suitable routings in a city. Besides, the system offers

Abstract = {{Recent disasters, such as the 2010 Haiti earthquake, have drawn

   such as Twitter, citizens create Volunteered Geographic Information
   (VGI). To effectively use this information for disaster management, we
   developed a VGI framework for the discovery of VGI. This framework
   consists of four components: (i) a VGI brokering module to provide a
   standard service interface to retrieve VGI from multiple resources based
   on spatial, temporal, and semantic parameters; (ii) a VGI quality
   control component, which employs semantic filtering and
   cross-referencing techniques to evaluate VGI; (iii) a VGI publisher
   module, which uses a service-based delivery mechanism to disseminate

Abstract = {{Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) such as data derived from the
   OpenStreetMap (OSM) project is a popular data source for freely

   data. This fact is frequently a cause of concern regarding the quality
   and usability of such data. In this study, the quality of OSM land use
   and land cover (LULC) data is investigated for an area in southern
   Germany. Two spatial data quality elements, thematic accuracy and
   completeness are addressed by comparing the OSM data with an
   authoritative German reference dataset. The results show that the kappa
   value indicates a substantial agreement between the OSM and the
   authoritative dataset. Nonetheless, for our study region, there are
   clear variations between the LULC classes. Forest covers a large area
   and shows both a high OSM completeness (97.6\%) and correctness
   (95.1\%). In contrast, farmland also covers a large area, but for this
   class OSM shows a low completeness value (45.9\%) due to unmapped areas.
   Additionally, the results indicate that a high population density, as
   present in urbanized areas, seems to denote a higher strength of
   agreement between OSM and the DLM (Digital Landscape Model). However, a
   low population density does not necessarily imply a low strength of

Abstract = {{Spatial data are fundamental for borderland analyses of geography,
   natural resources, demography, politics, economy, and culture. As the
   spatial data used in borderland research usually cover the borderland
   regions of several neighboring countries, it is difficult for anyone
   research institution of government to collect them. Volunteered
   Geographic Information (VGI) is a highly successful method for acquiring
   timely and detailed global spatial data at a very low cost. Therefore,
   VGI is a reasonable source of borderland spatial data. OpenStreetMap
   (OSM) is known as the most successful VGI resource. However, OSM's data
   model is far different from the traditional geographic information
   model. Thus, the OSM data must be converted in the scientist's
   customized data model. Because the real world changes rapidly, the
   converted data must be updated incrementally. Therefore, this paper
   presents a method used to dynamically integrate OSM data into the
   borderland database. In this method, a basic transformation rule base is
   formed by comparing the OSM Map Feature description document and the
   destination model definitions. Using the basic rules, the main features
   can be automatically converted to the destination model. A
   human-computer interaction model transformation and a
   rule/automatic-remember mechanism are developed to interactively
   transfer the unusual features that cannot be transferred by the basic
   rules to the target model and to remember the reusable rules
   automatically. To keep the borderland database current, the global
   OsmChange daily diff file is used to extract the change-only information
   for the research region. To extract the changed objects in the region
   under study, the relationship between the changed object and the
   research region is analyzed considering the evolution of the involved
   objects. In addition, five rules are determined to select the objects
   and integrate the changed objects with multi-versions over time. The
   objects' change-type evolution is analyzed, and seven rules are used to
   determine the change-type of the changed objects. Based on these rules
   and algorithms, we programmed an automatic (or semi-automatic)
   integrating and updating prototype system for the borderland database.
   The developed system was intensively tested using OSM data for Vietnam
   and Pakistan as the experimental data.}},

Abstract = {{There currently exists a wide variety of online resources providing
   mapping infrastructures and geographic information. Most web-based map
   services, such as Google Maps, Yahoo! Maps and Bing Maps, are mostly
   based on data that is collected by authoritative mapping agencies.
   Alternatively, some relatively new web-map services, such as
   OpenStreetMap (OSM) and Wikimapia, are mostly based on volunteered data
   collected by the public (e.g. crowdsourced mapping). Although such
   volunteered-based map services platforms show an increasing planimetric
   (2D) accuracy, completeness and update-rate of their mapping
   infrastructure, surprisingly enough, there is a lack of comparable data
   and accuracy measures in respect to the third dimension, i.e. height;
   more specifically, the topographic representation that is based on the
   volunteered collected data. Most of these web services still rely on
   existing open-source authoritative topographic infrastructures, and not
   on data collected by the volunteers. Moreover, topographic information
   that is open to the public and is free to use, e.g. advanced spaceborne
   thermal emission and reflection radiometer and shuttle radar topography
   mission, is regularly available with relatively low height accuracy (not
   better than 5 m) and low planimetric resolution (over 30 m). Volunteered
   data, on the other hand, collected by individuals that are situated `all
   over' the globe can offer with new capabilities and data characteristics
   having potentially higher qualities. This research proposes to examine
   the feasibility of using crowdsourced volunteered geographic information
   working paradigm for the task of producing a reliable digital terrain
   model (DTM) infrastructure for general use. This is achieved by
   collecting GPS observations that are available from VG data sources,
   while applying a 2D Kalman filter-based algorithm, aimed at reducing
   noise and ambiguities. This paper presents this methodology, with
   preliminary analysis results achieved by this implementation, showing
   the feasibility of this working methodology, having good results and
   accuracy of the DTM generated.}},

Abstract = {{The scope of the paper is to test if the online dynamic maps such as the

   paper presents the possibilities and the perspectives of OSM for spatial
   and attribute cadastral data collection and storage for the compilation
   of draft cadastral maps as an alternative methodology within the terms
   of the volunteered geographic information (VGI). The authors carried out
   a practical experiment in an extended part of the historic city centre
   of Athens and updated the online dynamic map of OSM with attribute and
   spatial cadastral data. Surveying students explored the capacities of
   the dynamic map in two steps: (a) in a section where the polygons of the
   buildings already existed on the map, they had to improve it with
   attribute data, and (b) in another section where no relevant polygons
   existed, a spatial and attribute data enhancement was required. The
   research was based on the various approaches that each student adopted
   and the freedom that the OSM offers to the users. The results show that
   users can easily distinguish the differences in capacities between the
   OSM and the commercial software; the inexpensive, easy to use and quick
   methodology of the OSM in contrast to the accurate, authoritative and
   assured methodology of the commercial software.}},

Abstract = {{As of 2010, 90\% of the data that existed in the world were created
   within the previous 2 years, while personal location data have been
   singled out as one of the five primary `big data' streams in the 2011
   McKinsey report. By 2020, the volume of existing data will increase by
   50-fold, where a large percentage of this volume will be associated with
   geospatial data. One of the reasons for this is the existence of the
   volunteered geographic information (VGI) paradigm, which encapsulates
   the idea of using the Internet (Web 2.0) to create, share, visualise,
   and analyse geographic information and knowledge. This neogeography
   revolution has started to fundamentally transform how geographic data
   are acquired, maintained, analysed, visualised, and consequently used.
   Thus, it has the potential to influence common practices, since it
   captures abroad knowledge of the environment we live in, in all aspects
   of life, encompassing new services to take place, applications and
   processes to be developed - all of which are location based. The
   diversity of applications and services that explore the potential of VGI
   argues for its current usability relevance: ranging from transportation
   network analysis, to air pollution and air quality, to natural disaster
   decision-making systems. This revolution has contributed to the
   development of two important working and knowledge paradigms:
   Crowdsourcing and Wisdom of the Crowd, widely used today within the
   mapping and geo-information discipline. Still, both terms are commonly
   misused and replaced. This paper aims at distinguishing between the
   terms via the quantitative and theoretical examination of four widely
   used social location-based services: OpenStreetMap (OSM), Moovit, Waze
   and Ushahidi. Eight primary characteristics that influence the paradigm
   of both Crowdsourcing and Wisdom of the Crowd are defined and examined,
   aiming to investigate and emphasise the differences between the four,
   namely: diversity, decentralisation, independency, aggregation,
   knowledge, activity, privacy and exploitation. It was found that OSM is
   an excellent example of a Crowdsourcing service, while though Ushahidi
   is considered as a Crowdsourcing service, its characteristics are
   coupled better with those of Wisdom of the Crowd. Moovit and Waze do not
   correspond to the Crowdsourcing paradigm, and thus are categorised as
   Wisdom of the Crowd services.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last few years, much online volunteered geographic information
   (VGI) has emerged and has been increasingly analyzed to understand
   places and cities, as well as human mobility and activity. However,
   there are concerns about the quality and usability of such VGI. In this
   study, we demonstrate a complete process that comprises the collection,
   unification, classification and validation of a type of VGI online
   point-of-interest (POI) data-and develop methods to utilize such POI
   data to estimate, disaggregated land use (i.e., employment size by
   category) at a very high spatial resolution (census block level) using
   part of the Boston metropolitan area as an example. With recent advances
   in activity-based land use, transportation, and environment (LUTE)
   models, such disaggregated land use data become important to allow LUTE
   models to analyze and simulate a person's choices of work location and
   activity destinations and to understand policy impacts on future cities.
   These data can also be used as alternatives to explore economic
   activities at the local level, especially as government-published
   census-based disaggregated employment data have become less available in
   the recent decade. Our new approach provides opportunities for cities to
   estimate land use at high resolution with low cost by utilizing VGI
   while ensuring its quality with a certain accuracy threshold. The
   automatic classification of POI can also be utilized for other types of
   analyses on cities. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) and urban forests have recently
   become topics of increasing interest in the social sciences. While
   social and environmental justice concerns have been applied to each of
   these topics individually, this paper addresses VGI, urban forests, and
   social justice simultaneously. VGI has often been hailed as an
   empowering and democratic new form of citizen science that allows data
   collection tasks to be distributed to a large group of people; however,
   concerns have emerged about whose geographies will be volunteered, and
   for what purpose. This research addresses these concerns, with an
   understanding that VGI has the potential to strengthen, rather than
   dissolve the digital divide. This is accomplished by determining the
   completeness of coverage of user-generated urban forest mapping on the
   interactive website PhillyTreeMap (http://www.phillytreemap.org/) by
   comparing it with high resolution remotely sensed canopy coverage data.
   These coverage levels are then regressed against Census demographic data
   at the block group level to determine if there are inequities in the
   coverage of this urban forest VGI project based upon socioeconomic
   status. Results indicate that sociodemographic variables influence the
   likelihood of increased coverage of the VGI urban forest data,
   presenting equity concerns surrounding the coverage of this VGI urban
   forest data. The presence of these social and environmental justice
   concerns indicates the need for expanded research into this new frontier
   of geographic data. Geographically weighted general linear models show
   non-stationarity in the relationships between VGI coverage and
   sociodemographic predictors, demonstrating the importance of
   incorporating local models. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Due to its relatively high availability and low cost, location-based
   social network (LBSN) (e.g., Foursquare) data (a popular type of
   volunteered geographic information) seem to be an alternative or
   complement to survey data in the study of travel behavior and activity
   analysis. Illustrating this situation, recently, a number of studies
   attempted to use LBSN data (e.g., Foursquare check-ins) to investigate
   patterns of human travel and activity. Of particular note is that
   compared to other individual-level characteristics of users, such as
   age, profession, education, income and so forth, gender is relatively
   highly available in the profiles of Foursquare users. Moreover,
   considering gender differences in travel and activity analysis is a
   popular research topic and is helpful in better understanding the
   changes in women's roles in family, labor force participation, society
   and so forth. Therefore, this paper empirically investigates how gender
   influences the travel and activity patterns of active local Foursquare
   users in New York City. Empirical investigations of gender differences
   in travel and activity patterns are conducted at both the individual and
   aggregate level. The empirical results reveal that there are gender
   differences in the travel and activity patterns of active local users in
   New York City at both the individual and aggregate level. Finally, the
   results of the empirical study and the extent to which LBSN data can be
   exploited to produce travel diary data are discussed.}},

   geometric differences and topological inconsistencies that need to be
   addressed. In this paper, we provide a methodology for integrating
   pedestrian facilities and obstructions information with an existing PND.
   At first we extracted the significant points from user-collected GPS
   trajectory by identifying the geometric difference index and attributes
   of each point. Then the extracted points were used to make an initial
   solution of the matching between the trajectory and the PND. Two
   geometrical algorithms were proposed and applied to reduce two kinds of
   errors in the matching: on dual lines and on intersections. Using the
   final solution for the matching, we reconstructed the node/link
   structure of PND including the facilities and obstructions information.
   Finally, performance was assessed with a test site and 79.2\% of the
   collected data were correctly integrated with the PND.}},

Abstract = {{The proliferation of volunteered geographic information (VGI), such as
   OpenStreetMap (OSM) enabled by technological advancements, has led to
   large volumes of user-generated geographical content. While this data is
   becoming widely used, the understanding of the quality characteristics
   of such data is still largely unexplored. An open research question is
   the relationship between demographic indicators and VGI quality. While
   earlier studies have suggested a potential relationship between VGI
   quality and population density or socio-economic characteristics of an
   area, such relationships have not been rigorously explored, and mainly
   remained qualitative in nature. This paper addresses this gap by
   quantifying the relationship between demographic properties of a given
   area and the quality of VGI contributions. We study specifically the
   demographic characteristics of the mapped area and its relation to two
   dimensions of spatial data quality, namely positional accuracy and
   completeness of the corresponding VGI contributions with respect to OSM
   using the Denver (Colorado, US) area as a case study. We use non-spatial
   and spatial analysis techniques to identify potential associations among
   demographics data and the distribution of positional and completeness
   errors found within VGI data. Generally, the results of our study show a
   lack of statistically significant support for the assumption that
   demographic properties affect the positional accuracy or completeness of
   VGI. While this research is focused on a specific area, our results
   showcase the complex nature of the relationship between VGI quality and
   demographics, and highlights the need for a better understanding of it.
   By doing so, we add to the debate of how demographics impact on the
   quality of VGI data and lays the foundation to further work.}},

   on a website, by means of a test that only a human could solve. Second,
   the effort of the user for this test is used to generate additional
   information, e.g., digitization of books or identification of house
   numbers. In this work, we present a concept for adapting the reCAPTCHA
   idea to create user-generated geographic information from earth
   observation data, and the requirements during the conception and
   implementation are depicted in detail. Furthermore, the essential parts
   of a Geo-reCAPTCHA system are described, and afterwards transferred, to
   a prototype implementation. An empirical user study is conducted to
   investigate the Geo-reCAPTCHA approach, assessing time and quality of
   the resulting geographic information. Our results show that a
   Geo-reCAPTCHA can be solved by the users of our study on building
   digitization in a short amount of time (19.2 s on average) with an
   overall average accuracy of the digitizations of 82.2\%. In conclusion,
   Geo-reCAPTCHA has the potential to be a reasonable alternative to the
   typical reCAPTCHA, and to become a new data-rich channel of crowdsourced
   geographic information. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in Web technologies have opened avenues to create
   socio-technical platforms that can empower citizens in urban planning
   processes. The rise of the GeoWeb and the popularity of Web 2.0
   collaborative tools can facilitate the development of a new generation
   of bottom-up Public Participatory GIS (PPGIS) platforms that can
   incorporate user-generated content into Spatial Data Infrastructures
   (SDIs). New service-based delivery mechanisms can provide architectural
   flexibility and adaptability, and enable the public to benefit from
   ubiquitous information access. From an e-participation perspective, Web
   2.0 social networking functions support interactive communication among
   various PPGIS stakeholders, e.g., citizens, planners, and decision
   makers. The main contribution of this article is to present a reference
   architecture for e-planning platforms that (1) facilitates effective
   e-participation by allowing multidirectional map-based communication
   among various land development stakeholders (e.g., planners, decision
   makers, citizens, etc.), and (2) enables incorporation of visualization,
   evaluation, and discussion capabilities to support community planning
   processes. To achieve this, we developed a service-oriented architecture
   (SOA) that exploits SDI principles and Web 2.0 technologies. The
   platform architecture allows heterogeneous data sources, analytical
   functionality and tools, and presentation frameworks to be plugged into
   a coherent system to provide a planning and decision support platform.
   We present two real-world implementations of the proposed architecture
   that have been developed to support community engagement in the City of
   Calgary, Canada.}},

Abstract = {{Public Participatory GIS (PPGIS) is a very broad field, and because of
   the direct outgrowth addressing questions raised regarding inequitable
   access to GIS and its societal impacts, PPGIS has become an exhaustive
   research area. Over the past two decades, several PPGIS initiatives have
   taken place in the western and non-western world. Several avenues have
   opened up, but nonetheless, questions regarding the effectiveness of
   such initiatives remain to be answered. Current research addressing the
   societal and political impacts of GIS have witnessed novel use of the
   technology and specialized spatial data provision such as volunteered
   geographic information, neogeography, geoweb, and map 2.0 (Goodchild,
   2007; Elwood 2010; Sui 2008) and have received increased attention from
   GIS scholars (Goodchild 2007; Elwood 2009; Sui 2008). A common thread
   tying such specialized use of technology is the participation by
   citizens with little or no GIS training, a long standing objective of
   the PPGIS area of inquiry. So, as we move into an era that is
   gravitating rapidly toward more specialized use of technology built on a
   similar foundation, it seems timely to reflect on the effectiveness and
   sustainability of PPGIS initiatives. This article reviews the history of
   PPGIS, its genesis, and some of the critical work within the PPGIS
   research arena. Finally, the paper reflects on where PPGIS stands today.}},

Abstract = {{In this article we critically discuss the challenge of integrating
   contextual information, in particular spatiotemporal contextual
   information, with human and technical sensor information, which we
   approach from a geospatial perspective. We start by highlighting the
   significance of context in general and spatiotemporal context in
   particular and introduce a smart city model of interactions between
   humans, the environment, and technology, with context at the common
   interface. We then focus on both the intentional and the unintentional
   sensing capabilities of today's technologies and discuss current
   technological trends that we consider have the ability to enrich human
   and technical geo-sensor information with contextual detail. The
   different types of sensors used to collect contextual information are
   analyzed and sorted into three groups on the basis of names considering
   frequently used related terms, and characteristic contextual parameters.
   These three groups, namely technical in situ sensors, technical remote
   sensors, and human sensors are analyzed and linked to three dimensions
   involved in sensing (data generation, geographic phenomena, and type of
   sensing). In contrast to other scientific publications, we found a large
   number of technologies and applications using in situ and mobile
   technical sensors within the context of smart cities, and surprisingly
   limited use of remote sensing approaches. In this article we further
   provide a critical discussion of possible impacts and influences of both
   technical and human sensing approaches on society, pointing out that a
   larger number of sensors, increased fusion of information, and the use
   of standardized data formats and interfaces will not necessarily result
   in any improvement in the quality of life of the citizens of a smart
   city. This article seeks to improve our understanding of technical and
   human geo-sensing capabilities, and to demonstrate that the use of such
   sensors can facilitate the integration of different types of contextual
   information, thus providing an additional, namely the geo-spatial
   perspective on the future development of smart cities.}},

Abstract = {{Each year Australia is prone to potential negative and devastating

   Volunteered geographic information (VGI) is an emerging technology that

   Service, a survey of 154 participants across 12 communities at bushfire

Abstract = {{Effective flood risk management requires updated information to ensure
   that the correct decisions can be made. This can be provided by Wireless
   Sensor Networks (WSN) which are a low-cost means of collecting updated
   information about rivers. Another valuable resource is Volunteered
   Geographic Information (VGI) which is a comparatively new means of
   improving the coverage of monitored areas because it is able to supply
   supplementary information to the WSN and thus support decision-making in
   flood risk management. However, there still remains the problem of how
   to combine WSN data with VGI. In this paper, an attempt is made to
   investigate AGORA-DS, which is a Spatial Decision Support System (SDSS)
   that is able to make flood risk management more effective by combining
   these data sources, i.e. WSN with VGI. This approach is built over a
   conceptual model that complies with the interoperable standards laid
   down by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) - e.g. Sensor Observation
   Service (SOS) and Web Feature Service (WFS) - and seeks to combine and
   present unified information in a web-based decision support tool. This
   work was deployed in a real scenario of flood risk management in the
   town of So Carlos in Brazil. The evidence obtained from this deployment
   confirmed that interoperable standards can support the integration of
   data from distinct data sources. In addition, they also shqw that VG! is
   able to provide information about areas of the river basin which lack
   data since there is no appropriate station in the area. Hence it
   provides a valuable support for the WSN data. It can thus be concluded
   that AGORA-DS is able to combine information provided by WSN and VGI,
   and provide useful information for supporting flood risk management. (C)

Abstract = {{Numerous exegeses have been written about the epistemologies of

   Borgmann's philosophy of technology we offer a critique that, rather
   than appreciating the contours of this new form of data, truth appears
   to derive from traditional analytic views of information found within
   GIScience. This is assisted by structures that enable VGI to be treated
   as independent of the process that led to its creation. Allusions to
   individual emancipation further hamper VGI and problematise
   participatory practices in mapping/geospatial technologies (e.g. public

Abstract = {{Providing up-to-date and reliable dynamic traffic information has become
   a major challenge in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Current
   traffic information services employ participatory sensing and crowd
   sourcing techniques to provide dynamic traffic information consisting of
   estimated travel times and congestion warnings. In this paper we propose
   the crowd sensing system based on smartphones and integrated GPS and
   accelerometer sensors, to capture dynamic, short-lasting traffic events
   and drivers' aggressive and risky behavior like excessive breaking,
   sudden lane change, open turns, speed excess and route deviations. These
   traffic events can be categorized as risky driving situations or near
   accidents and are typically not included in any official traffic
   statistics. The system uses crowd intelligence based on participatory
   sensing paradigm and collaborative mechanisms to detect important
   traffic events/situations. It provides proactive notification and
   recommendations to drivers in the vicinity of, or on the route to
   reported events. The proposed crowd sensing system ensures information
   reliability through space-time clustering of reported events/situations
   while preserving drivers' privacy. We perform the evaluation of our
   system that demonstrates the effectiveness and usefulness of advanced
   navigation service based on it, that uses collected dynamic traffic
   events to provide warning and notifications to drivers and safest route
   navigation. This novel functionality of a navigation service enhances
   drivers' situational awareness, increasing safety and effectiveness of

Abstract = {{It is now common for researchers in natural resource management and

   new map is combined with household survey data to explore respondent's

   The results suggest that VGI can be a useful resource to researchers in

Abstract = {{Geo-located information is increasingly important for regional decision
   making and spatial assessment. Toronto has witnessed rapid demographic
   and economic change over the last decades, making the Toronto region the
   fourth largest economic centre in North America. From a policymaker's
   perspective, understanding land use for planning purposes is critical
   for better urban planning. Such information is, however, conditioned by
   classical surveying and sophisticated remote sensing techniques, which
   are often costly and spatially not feasible. Only local knowledge and
   information can really bridge this gap, as urban land use in denser
   urban regions is often very fine-grained information. Volunteered
   geo-information (VGI) sources are fundamental tools for the assessment
   of urban land use patterns. This article identifies land use patterns
   using VGI and offers a comparative assessment with traditionally
   classified land use features from remote sensing imagery for Toronto. A
   parcel-based analysis of the voluntarily shared spatial information is
   used and extended at a regional level, with an overall accuracy of 75
   percent. Additionally, a per-class analysis confirms which land classes
   can be well (or poorly) mapped, and what level of disagreement exists

Abstract = {{Crowdsourcing geospatial data mainly collected by public citizens have
   brought about a profound transformation on data acquisition and
   utilization. However, the unpredictable positional accuracies,
   unstructured semantic descriptions, and invalid spatial relations occur
   to crowdsourcing geospatial data, causing difficulties for conflating
   heterogeneous data sets collected by different professional agencies or
   volunteers. We thus propose a novel pattern-mining approach to conflate
   crowdsourcing road networks with points of interest (POIs) geometrically
   and semantically. The proposed method mines the geometric patterns
   between road networks and POIs respectively and generates the
   pattern-related skeleton graphs for them. Then, corresponding points are
   determined between the two skeleton graphs to align POIs and road
   networks geometrically, and the road-related semantic data between the
   associated POIs and the road segments are compared to check the data
   quality of POIs and infer the road names of the road segments.
   Experimental results show the advantages of our proposed method,
   demonstrating a functional and promising solution for enriching POIs and
   road network geometrically and semantically.}},

Abstract = {{Urban form and function have been studied extensively in urban planning
   and geographical information science. However, gaining a greater
   understanding of how they merge to define the urban morphology remains a
   substantial scientific challenge. Toward this goal, this paper addresses
   the opportunities presented by the emergence of crowdsourced data to
   gain novel insights into form and function in urban spaces. We are
   focusing in particular on information harvested from social media and
   other open-source and volunteered datasets (e.g. trajectory and
   OpenStreetMap data). These data provide a first-hand account of form and
   function from the people who define urban space through their
   activities. This novel bottom-up approach to study these concepts
   complements traditional urban studies to provide a new lens for studying
   urban activity. By synthesizing recent advancements in the analysis of
   open-source data, we provide a new typology for characterizing the role
   of crowdsourcing in the study of urban morphology. We illustrate this
   new perspective by showing how social media, trajectory, and traffic
   data can be analyzed to capture the evolving nature of a city's form and
   function. While these crowd contributions may be explicit or implicit in
   nature, they are giving rise to an emerging research agenda for
   monitoring, analyzing, and modeling form and function for urban design

   The practice of private citizens generating online geospatial data
   presents new opportunities for the creation and dissemination of

   information for disaster management at a fraction of the resource costs

   explore and understand the implications of these data and data practices
   for disaster management. In this article, we review the current state of
   knowledge in this emerging field and present recommendations for future
   research. Significantly, we note further research is warranted in the
   pre-event phases of disaster management, where VGI may present an
   opportunity to connect and engage individuals in disaster preparation

   land rights, or just reflections of institutional isomorphism?}},
Journal = {{SURVEY REVIEW}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{47}},

Abstract = {{In many countries, authority for maintaining records of land ownership
   lies with national or state institutes, called `cadastres' or `land
   registries'. The emergence of volunteered geographic information (VGI)
   and crowdsourcing potentially challenges this state based authority,
   enabling the construction of `neo'-cadastres (using the analogy of
   `neo'geography). Individual citizens can themselves map and record land
   tenure rights. This paper explores if and how VGI and crowdsourcing may
   redefine the state based cadastres and land registries, and the roles of
   land users who claim land rights outside of the state based
   institutions. Using theories of institutions and isomorphism we
   hypothesise that a parallel exists between emerging open systems and
   situations where no state-based cadastre exists: participants in both
   situations will position themselves to protect their interests. Three
   cases from Ghana, Canada, and Indonesia demonstrate how land users
   indicate their land tenure right boundaries based on personal views (the
   neo-cadastre), rather than on rules stipulated by a national authority
   (the traditional cadastre). In each case land users root their behaviour
   partly in local dependency relations and social advocacy networks. These
   locally embedded rules may not necessarily coincide with hierarchical
   institutional relations. Even in participatory adjudication activities
   conducted under the authority of national cadastres, land users are not
   completely free in providing their land boundaries. Instead, they adhere
   to certain locally embedded microsocial conventions. We conclude that
   VGI and crowdsourced based neo-cadastres will likely redefine, from
   passive to active, the roles of land users in cadastres. This creates an
   opportunity for citizens, but also a potential risk. Where implicit
   rules of the neo-cadastre do not co-evolve with traditional cadastral
   institutions, conflicts of land information and access to land may
   emerge. Neo-cadastres will be an artefact of this dissatisfaction, and
   may reflect new directions for cadastral institutions. Neo-cadastres
   will not be a direct trigger for wider cadastral change, but a piece of
   evidence that change and resistance are occurring.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, social media emerged as a potential resource to improve
   the management of crisis situations such as disasters triggered by
   natural hazards. Although there is a growing research body concerned
   with the analysis of the usage of social media during disasters, most
   previous work has concentrated on using social media as a stand-alone
   information source, whereas its combination with other information
   sources holds a still underexplored potential. This article presents an
   approach to enhance the identification of relevant messages from social
   media that relies upon the relations between georeferenced social media
   messages as Volunteered Geographic Information and geographic features
   of flood phenomena as derived from authoritative data (sensor data,
   hydrological data and digital elevation models). We apply this approach
   to examine the micro-blogging text messages of the Twitter platform
   (tweets) produced during the River Elbe Flood of June 2013 in Germany.
   This is performed by means of a statistical analysis aimed at
   identifying general spatial patterns in the occurrence of flood-related
   tweets that may be associated with proximity to and severity of flood
   events. The results show that messages near (up to 10km) to severely
   flooded areas have a much higher probability of being related to floods.
   In this manner, we conclude that the geographic approach proposed here
   provides a reliable quantitative indicator of the usefulness of messages
   from social media by leveraging the existing knowledge about natural
   hazards such as floods, thus being valuable for disaster management in
   both crisis response and preventive monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{Binaries, the most reductive form of categorization, can be usefully
   invoked to characterize emerging phenomena; yet, they are widely

   content analysis this article traces the emergence of volunteered
   geographic information (VGI), and identifies the recurrent use of
   several related binaries to contrast this phenomenon with the

   deconstructed by identifying a mismatch in how VGI is conceptualized

   existing VGI projects. As an alternative to a binary conceptualization
   of spatial data production, a different representation is put forward
   that more accurately depicts what is in actuality a vast, shifting, and
   heterogeneous landscape of spatial data production approaches. Thinking
   about contemporary spatial data production not as a binary but as a

Abstract = {{OpenStreetMap (OSM), an open source mapping platform aiming to provide a
   free world map by registered users, has often been recognized as one of
   the prime examples of volunteered geographic information (VGI)
   construction. This is reflective of the recent exponential growth of
   user-generated geographic data facilitated by Web 2.0 technologies and
   location-aware devices. Notable efforts have been taken to investigate
   OSM developments and associated socio-political implications. However,
   still little is known about those less active contributors who
   constitute the majority of the contributors or long tail contributors in
   OSM and many other VGI initiatives. I therefore present an account of
   the dynamics of OSM mapping practices including these long tail
   contributors. Based on this investigation, I argue for a broader
   conceptualization of interactivity in VGI mappings, one that moves
   beyond a narrow focus on the mapping interface regarding the encounters
   between these VGI contributors and VGI initiatives. I suggest that this
   is helpful to better capture these dynamic and heterogeneous mapping
   practices constituting the data and representation in OSM, which in turn
   may have wider implications for everyday mapping and knowledge
   production.
   Les secrets de la conception d'OpenStreetMap : un court bilan Resume
   OpenStreetMap (OSM) est une plate-forme de cartographie en acces libre
   visant a fournir aux utilisateurs enregistres une carte du monde
   gratuite que l'on cite souvent comme l'un des exemples les plus
   apparents du chantier de l'information geographique volontaire (IGV).
   Celui-ci est le reflet de la recente croissance fulgurante des donnees
   geographiques generees par les utilisateurs qui est soutenue par les
   technologies Web 2.0 et les dispositifs de geolocalisation. Des travaux
   d'envergure ont ete entrepris pour enqueter sur l'evolution d'OSM et les
   consequences sociopolitiques qui en decoulent. Toutefois, on en sait
   encore peu sur les contributeurs moins actifs qui constituent la
   majorite, c'est-a-dire les contributeurs occasionnels d'OSM et de
   nombreuses autres initiatives d'IGV. Je brosse donc un tableau de la
   dynamique qui caracterise les pratiques de cartographie d'OSM en tenant
   compte des collaborateurs occasionnels. En tirant parti des resultats de
   cette enquete, je soutiens l'idee d'une conceptualisation elargie de
   l'<< interactivite >> dans les cartographies d'IGV qui depasse la vision
   etriquee de l'interface de cartographie servant de points de contact
   entre ces contributeurs et les initiatives d'IGV. J'en conclus que ceci
   peut contribuer a mieux cerner ces pratiques de cartographie dynamiques
   et heterogenes sur lesquelles se fondent les donnees et la
   representation d'OSM, ce qui pourrait ainsi entrainer des consequences
   de plus grande ampleur sur la cartographie au quotidien et la production

Abstract = {{Control data are critical for improving areal interpolation results.
   Remotely sensed imagery, road network, and parcels are the three most

   Meanwhile, the open access geographic data generated by social networks

   other purpose of this study is to test the effect of age bias control
   data on estimation of different age group populations. Results suggest
   that geo-located tweets as single control data does not perform as well
   as the three other control layers for total population and all
   age-specific population groups. However, the noticeable enhancement
   effect of Twitter data on other control data, especially for age groups

   better reflect population distribution by increasing variation in
   densities within a residential area delineated by other control data.

Abstract = {{Until recently, land surveys and digital interpretation of remotely
   sensed imagery have been used to generate land use inventories. These
   techniques however, are often cumbersome and costly, allocating large
   amounts of technical and temporal costs. The technological advances of
   web 2.0 have brought a wide array of technological achievements,
   stimulating the participatory role in collaborative and crowd sourced
   mapping products. This has been fostered by GPS-enabled devices, and
   accessible tools that enable visual interpretation of high resolution
   satellite images/air photos provided in collaborative mapping projects.
   Such technologies offer an integrative approach to geography by means of
   promoting public participation and allowing accurate assessment and
   classification of land use as well as geographical features.
   OpenStreetMap (OSM) has supported the evolution of such techniques,
   contributing to the existence of a large inventory of spatial land use
   information. This paper explores the introduction of this novel
   participatory phenomenon for land use classification in Europe's
   metropolitan regions. We adopt a positivistic approach to assess
   comparatively the accuracy of these contributions of OSM for land use
   classifications in seven large European metropolitan regions. Thematic
   accuracy and degree of completeness of OSM data was compared to
   available Global Monitoring for Environment and Security Urban Atlas
   (GMESUA) datasets for the chosen metropolises. We further extend our
   findings of land use within a novel framework for geography, justifying
   that volunteered geographic information (VGI) sources are of great
   benefit for land use mapping depending on location and degree of VGI
   dynamism and offer a great alternative to traditional mapping techniques
   for metropolitan regions throughout Europe. Evaluation of several land
   use types at the local level suggests that a number of OSM classes (such
   as anthropogenic land use, agricultural and some natural environment
   classes) are viable alternatives for land use classification. These
   classes are highly accurate and can be integrated into planning
   decisions for stakeholders and policymakers. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

   models that are used for many applications. This study combines the
   advantages of both ALS and OSM, offering a promising new approach that
   enhances data quality and allows change detection: the mainly up-to-date
   2D data of OSM can be combined with the high-resolution-but rarely
   updated-elevation information provided by ALS. This case study
   investigates building objects of OSM and ALS data of the city of
   Bregenz, Austria. Data quality of OSM is discerned by the comparison of
   building footprints using different true positive definitions (e. g.
   overlapping area). High quality of OSM data is revealed, yet also
   limitations of each method with respect to heterogeneous regions and
   building outlines are identified. For the first time, an up-to-date
   Digital Surface Model (DSM) combining 2D OSM and ALS data is achieved. A
   multitude of applications such as flood simulations and solar potential

   communicating landscape changes}},
Journal = {{LAND USE POLICY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{43}},
Pages = {{82-95}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{This paper reports on a potential new form of data generation and data
   display to be used for communicating landscape change at local scales,
   utilizing a huge collection of oblique aerial photographs held by the
   Royal Library in Copenhagen. The collection contains local scale imagery
   covering all parts of Denmark recorded between 1930 and 1990 and thus
   has the potential to illustrate the changes which took place in the
   rural landscape as a whole after the Second World War, in ways which are
   suited for use at local scales. Taking into account that landscape
   change normally happens at a slow rate relative to the perceptive scale
   of humans, with fine grained changes taking place continuously in local
   settings, images of this kind present themselves as a way for the
   general public to become aware of changes which might otherwise be
   overlooked. To a still more urbanized population where most people do
   not have an every-day experience with rural landscape change, the images
   may be a starting point for a renewed engagement with landscapes, not
   just perceived as a scenery, but rather as a process of interaction with
   the environment. In order to inform a wider range of people, in
   competition with other types of information, the imagery provides a
   point of reference - a single farm or landscape known to the users which
   people without specific training in landscape research can relate to.
   The use of a crowdsourcing approach in data generation on a webgis
   application means that the broader public is both involved in the
   creation of the data and in the discussion about the changes observed,
   which become visible when comparing old aerial photographs to the
   present landscape. In combination with the very local nature of the
   aerial photographs, this opens up the possibility that the images could
   serve as a communicational bridge between ``abstract{''} scientific
   knowledge about landscape change (e.g. change in hedgerow density per
   year) and the local landscapes where people are living. As such, the
   approach described in this paper may contribute to the objectives set
   out in the European landscape convention to facilitate an increased
   understanding of landscape issues among the public through a democratic
   learning process. The article concludes, that this approach has a huge
   potential, although some difficulties exist, relating to the challenge
   of maintaining a focus on the landscape when using a form of
   communication which is dialogue-based and relatively unstructured
   compared to approaches embedded within conventional learning
   environments. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   OpenStreetMap (OSM) indicate the success of this VGI-based project in
   attracting diverse sets of people from all over the world. A huge amount

   faces the challenge of ensuring data quality. Spatial data quality
   comprises several basic elements; among them, logical consistency
   concerns the existence of logical contradictions within a dataset. It is
   one of the most important elements, but has not been studied much in VGI
   despite the key role in quality assurance. Because of the participatory
   nature of data collection and entry in OSM, the common consistency
   checking routines for spatial data should be revised. Since contributors
   have different views about objects, data integration in OSM may be
   considered as a form of multi-representation data combination. In this
   article, the concept of spatial similarity in multi-representation
   considering three elements, i.e. directional relationships, topological
   relationships, and metric distance relationships, is used to build a

Abstract = {{Land use (LU) maps are an important source of information in academia
   and for policy-makers describing the usage of land parcels. A large
   amount of effort and monetary resources are spent on mapping LU features
   over time and at local, regional, and global scales. Remote sensing
   images and signal processing techniques, as well as land surveying are
   the prime sources to map LU features. However, both data gathering
   approaches are financially expensive and time consuming. But recently,
   Web 2.0 technologies and the wide dissemination of GPSenabled devices
   boosted public participation in collaborative mapping projects (CMPs).
   In this regard, the OpenStreetMap (OSM) project has been one of the most
   successful representatives, providing LU features. The main objective of
   this paper is to comparatively assess the accuracy of the contributed
   OSM-LU features in four German metropolitan areas versus the
   pan-European GMESUA dataset as a reference. Kappa index analysis along
   with per-class user's and producers' accuracies are used for accuracy
   assessment. The empirical findings suggest OSM as an alternative
   complementary source for extracting LU information whereas exceeding 50
   \% of the selected cities are mapped by mappers. Moreover, the results
   identify which land types preserve high/moderate/low accuracy across
   cities for urban LU mapping. The findings strength the potential of
   collaboratively collected LU features for providing temporal LU maps as
   well as updating/enriching existing inventories. Furthermore, such a
   collaborative approach can be used for collecting a global coverage of
   LU information specifically in countries in which temporal and monetary
   efforts could be minimized.}},

Abstract = {{Studies have analyzed the quality of volunteered geographic information
   (VGI) datasets, assessing the positional accuracy of features and the
   semantic accuracy of the attributes. While it has been shown that VGI
   can, in some contexts, reach a high positional accuracy, these studies
   have also highlighted a large spatial heterogeneity in positional
   accuracy and completeness, but also concerning the semantics of the
   objects. Such high semantic heterogeneity of VGI datasets becomes a
   significant obstacle to a number of possible uses that could be made of
   the data. This paper proposes an approach for both improving the
   semantic quality and reducing the semantic heterogeneity of VGI
   datasets. The improvement of the semantic quality is achieved by using a
   tag recommender system, called OSMantic, which automatically suggests
   relevant tags to contributors during the editing process. Such an
   approach helps contributors find the most appropriate tags for a given
   object, hence reducing the overall dataset semantic heterogeneity. The
   approach was implemented into a plugin for the Java OpenStreetMap editor
   (JOSM) and different examples illustrate how this plugin can be used to
   improve the quality of VGI data. This plugin has been tested by OSM
   contributors and evaluated using an online questionnaire. Results of the
   evaluation suggest a high level of satisfaction from users and are

Abstract = {{Critical cartographic scholarship has demonstrated that maps (and
   geoinformation in general) can never be neutral or objective: maps are
   always embedded in specific social contexts of production and use and
   thus unavoidably reproduce social conventions and hierarchies.
   Furthermore, it has been argued that maps also (re) produce certain
   geographies and thus social realities. This argument shifts attention to
   the constitutive effects of maps and the ways in which they make the
   world. Within the discussion on neogeography and volunteered geographic
   information, it has been argued that crowd sourcing offers a radical
   alternative to conventional ways of map making, challenging the hegemony
   of official and commercial cartographies. In this view, crowd-sourced
   Web 2.0-mapping projects such as OpenStreetMap (OSM) might begin to
   offer a forum for different voices, mapping new things, enabling new
   ways of living. In our contribution, we frame a research agenda that
   draws upon critical cartography but widens the scope of analysis to the
   assemblages of practices, actors, technologies, and norms at work: an
   agenda which is inspired by the ``critical GIS{''}-literature, to take
   the specific social contexts and effects of technologies into account,
   but which deploys a processual view of mapping. We recognize that a
   fundamental transition in mapping is taking place, and that OSM may well
   be of central importance in this process. However, we stress that social
   conventions, political hegemonies, unequal economic and technical
   resources etc. do not fade away with crowdsourced Web 2.0 projects, but
   rather transform themselves and impact upon mapping practices. Together
   these examples suggest that research into OSM might usefully reflect
   more critically on the contexts in which new geographic knowledge is
   being assembled.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to address changes in public communication
   following the advent of Internet social networking tools and the
   emerging web 2.0 technologies which are providing new ways of sharing
   information and knowledge. In particular public administrations are
   called upon to reinvent the governance of public affairs and to update
   the means for interacting with their communities. The paper develops an
   analysis of the distribution, diffusion and performance of the official
   profiles on Twitter adopted by the Italian municipalities (comuni) up to
   November 2013. It aims to identify the patterns of spatial distribution
   and the drivers of the diffusion of Twitter profiles; the performance of
   the profiles through an aggregated index, called the Twitter performance
   index (Twiperindex), which evaluates the profiles' activity with
   reference to the gravitational areas of the municipalities in order to
   enable comparisons of the activity of municipalities with different
   demographic sizes and functional roles. The results show that only a
   small portion of innovative municipalities have adopted Twitter to
   enhance e-participation and e-governance and that the drivers of the
   diffusion seem to be related either to past experiences and existing
   conditions (i.e. civic networks, digital infrastructures) developed over
   time or to strong local community awareness. The better performances are
   achieved mainly by small and medium-sized municipalities. Of course, the
   phenomenon is very new and fluid, therefore this analysis should be
   considered as a first step in ongoing research which aims to grasp the
   dynamics of these new means of public communication.}},

Abstract = {{We discuss an OpenStreetMap (OSM) mapping party organised during the
   Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial (FOSS4G) Europe 2015
   conference held in Como, Italy in July 2015. While primarily the mapping
   party was organised as a conference social event, there was also the
   serious goal of collecting and adding geographic data to the OSM
   database of Como city. Our paper describes the organisation, planning
   and structure of the mapping party. Results show that considerable
   amounts of data was collected and uploaded to OSM. Overall there was
   very good interest in the mapping party with 40 participants. While the
   majority of participants were delegates at the conference and
   consequently could be considered highly skilled GIS practitioners only a
   very small number had actually contributed data to OSM in the past. We
   discuss the key lessons learned and overall positive and negative
   aspects of this mapping party.}},

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{2495}},
Pages = {{101-111}},
Abstract = {{Finding a scenic route between two locations is a common trip-planning
   task, in particular for tourists and recreational travelers. For the
   automated computation of a scenic route in a trip-planning system to
   function, it is necessary to understand which attributes of a route and
   its surroundings are associated with attractive scenery. One way to find
   this information is with a route choice model framework, which requires
   a choice set of realistic paths for traveling a scenic route. This paper
   proposes a constrained enumeration type algorithm for computing scenic
   alternatives with a branch-and-bound approach and a labeling algorithm
   in combination with link elimination to generate a scenic route choice
   set. These algorithms use volunteered geographic information shared,
   geotagged photos (photos to which geographical identification metadata
   have been added) from Panoramio-to generate path alternatives. The
   results show that the proposed branch-and-bound algorithm replicated
   observe travel behavior better than the traditional deterministic
   minimum cost based algorithms in terms of overlap and consistency. In
   addition, for the proposed branch-and-bound method, the average number
   of scenic clusters was almost identical to that found along observed
   scenic routes; this method outperformed all other evaluated algorithms
   for this aspect.}},

   foundational drivers, which are: the recognition of the value of vulgar
   local knowledge, and the acceleration of cyberspace communication
   capacities. Section 2 analyses VGI modalities and systems in terms of
   their characteristics and practices, in a frame of good governance
   principles and participatory process. In Section 3 this analytical
   framework is used in evaluating two specific cases in terms of
   governance and participation principles and practice. The paper

   surveillance. Current advances in these geospatial technologies enable
   geographers both professional and citizen geographers to contribute,

   There are a number of challenges to incorporating collaborative tools in
   spatial decision-making e.g., a lack of interoperability with other
   tools commonly used by organizations, and a lack of generality to enable
   sustainable processes within a group accomplishing a specific task. A
   Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) presents a possible solution to these

   two main strategies for network matching: segment-based and node-based
   matching. The comparison shows that the result quality is comparable for
   the two strategies, but the node-based result is considerably more
   computationally efficient. Therefore, we improve the accuracy of

   patterns of complicated network components. Finally, we conduct a case
   study on the extended node-based algorithm in which we match OSM to the

Journal = {{NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1985-1997}},
Abstract = {{Recreational activities in snow-covered mountainous terrain in the
   backcountry account for the vast majority of avalanche accidents.
   Studies analyzing avalanche risk mostly rely on accident statistics
   without considering exposure (or the elements at risk), i. e., how many,
   when and where people are recreating, as data on recreational activity
   in the winter mountains are scarce. To fill this gap, we explored
   volunteered geographic information on two social media mountaineering
   websites-bergportal.ch and camptocamp.org. Based on these data, we
   present a spatiotemporal pattern of winter backcountry touring activity
   in the Swiss Alps and compare this with accident statistics.
   Geographically, activity was concentrated in Alpine regions relatively
   close to the main Swiss population centers in the west and north. In
   contrast, accidents occurred equally often in the less-frequented
   inner-alpine regions. Weekends, weather and avalanche conditions
   influenced the number of recreationists, while the odds to be involved
   in a severe avalanche accident did not depend on weekends or weather
   conditions. However, the likelihood of being involved in an accident
   increased with increasing avalanche danger level, but also with a more
   unfavorable snowpack containing persistent weak layers (also referred to
   as an old snow problem). In fact, the most critical situation for
   backcountry recreationists and professionals occurred on days and in
   regions when both the avalanche danger was critical and when the
   snowpack contained persistent weak layers. The frequently occurring
   geographical pattern of a more unfavorable snowpack structure also
   explains the relatively high proportion of accidents in the
   less-frequented inner-alpine regions. These results have practical
   implications: avalanche forecasters should clearly communicate the
   avalanche danger and the avalanche problem to the backcountry user,
   particularly if persistent weak layers are of concern. Professionals and
   recreationists, on the other hand, require the expertise to adjust the
   planning of a tour and their backcountry travel behavior depending on
   the avalanche danger and the avalanche problem.}},

Abstract = {{The type of data an individual contributor adds to OpenStreetMap (OSM)
   varies by region. The local knowledge of a data contributor allows for
   the collection and editing of detailed features such as small trails,
   park benches or fire hydrants, as well as adding attribute information
   that can only be accessed locally. As opposed to this, satellite imagery
   that is provided as background images in OSM data editors, such as ID,
   Potlatch or JOSM, facilitates the contribution of less detailed data
   through on-screen digitizing, oftentimes for areas the contributor is
   less familiar with. Knowing whether an area is part of a contributor's
   home region or not can therefore be a useful predictor of OSM data
   quality for a geographic region. This research explores the editing
   history of nodes and ways for 13 highly active OSM members within a
   two-tiered clustering process to delineate an individual mapper's home
   region from remotely mapped areas. The findings are evaluated against
   those found with a previously introduced method which determines a
   contributor's home region solely based on spatial clustering of created
   nodes. The comparison shows that both methods are able to delineate
   similar home regions for the 13 contributors with some differences.}},

Abstract = {{Volunteered geographic information (VGI) is geographic information
   collected by way of crowdsourcing. However, the distinction between VGI
   as an information product and the processes that create VGI is blurred.
   Clearly, the environment that influences the creation of VGI is
   different than the information product itself, yet most literature
   treats them as one and the same. Thus, this research is motivated by the
   need to formalize and standardize the systems that support the creation
   of VGI. To this end, we propose a conceptual framework for VGI systems,
   the main components of which-project, participants, and technical
   infrastructure-form an environment conducive to the creation of VGI.
   Drawing on examples from OpenStreetMap, Ushahidi, and RinkWatch, we
   illustrate the pragmatic relevance of these components. Applying a
   system perspective to VGI allows us to better understand the components
   and functionality needed to effectively create VGI.}},

Abstract = {{Crowdsourcing is not a new practice but it is a concept that has gained
   substantial attention during recent disasters. Drawing from previous
   work in the crisis informatics, disaster sociology, and
   computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) literature, this paper first
   explains recent conceptualizations of crowdsourcing and how
   crowdsourcing is a way of leveraging disaster convergence. The CSCW
   concept of ``articulation work{''} is introduced as an interpretive
   frame for extracting the salient dimensions of ``crisis
   crowdsourcing.{''} Then, a series of vignettes are presented to
   illustrate the evolution of crisis crowdsourcing that spontaneously
   emerged after the 2010 Haiti earthquake and evolved to more established
   forms of public engagement during crises. The best practices extracted
   from the vignettes clarified the efforts to formalize crisis
   crowdsourcing through the development of innovative interfaces designed
   to support the articulation work needed to facilitate spontaneous
   volunteer efforts. Extracting these best practices led to the
   development of a conceptual framework that unpacks the key dimensions of
   crisis crowdsourcing. The Crisis Crowdsourcing Framework is a
   systematic, problem-driven approach to determining the why, who, what,
   when, where, and how aspects of a crowdsourcing system. The framework
   also draws attention to the social, technological, organizational, and
   policy (STOP) interfaces that need to be designed to manage the
   articulation work involved with reducing the complexity of coordinating
   across these key dimensions. An example of how to apply the framework to
   design a crowdsourcing system is offered with a discussion on the
   implications for applying this framework as well as the limitations of
   this framework. Innovation is occurring at the social, technological,
   organizational, and policy interfaces enabling crowdsourcing to be
   operationalized and integrated into official products and services.}},

Abstract = {{There has been greater tendency towards embracing the potential of the
   Web 2.0 in knowledge creation with user contributions becoming
   significantly important in the development of open data such as
   Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI). An increasing number of
   volunteers which add value to geospatial data require effective ways of
   organising and providing access to value-added or newly created data.
   Metadata records are often unavailable for VGI, making it problematic
   for users to discover data in the VGI system. This paper discusses
   potential approaches that can be used to create metadata for VGI. This
   includes Linked Data, professionally created metadata and metadata
   created by volunteers. The paper then discusses the shortcomings of
   these approaches and proposes an unconventional alternative, Geospatial
   Metadata 2.0. This approach involves VGI users in the creation of
   metadata, and builds on folksonomies created by them. The paper presents
   the design and implementation of this idea in a prototype system along
   with an assessment result. The implementation includes Geospatial
   Metadata 2.0 add-ons in Geonetwork, and the assessment benefits from the
   input of metadata experts worldwide. The assessment of the benefits
   results indicate such an approach of metadata creation is promising and
   has the potential to be employed in VGI systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

   As the role of information and communications technologies (ICTs) grows,
   governments have seen the Geoweb and Web 2.0 as an opportunity to
   increase citizen involvement through e-government which provides

   represent citizens' most direct contact with local governments in the
   form of volunteered geographic information (VGI) empowering citizens
   with the means of solving community issues. Past studies have examined
   VGI and e-government use finding patterns of a digital divide with

   these patterns using citizen-generated data is needed to understand the
   link between users and the content they create. This paper seeks to
   explore the relationship between sociodemographic status and 311 service
   request frequency in three cities within the United States using

   needs to be known. However, roof material information is not readily
   available in the Canadian public domain. To overcome this challenge, a
   unique Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) application was
   developed using Google Street View that engages citizens to classify the
   roof materials of single dwelling residences in a simple and intuitive

Abstract = {{It has been argued that crowd-sourcing offers a radical alternative to
   conventional ways of mapping, challenging the hegemony of official and
   commercial cartographies. In this view mapping might begin to offer a
   forum for different voices, mapping different things, enabling new ways
   of living. Instead of the Latourian notion of the map as immutable
   mobile, fixing knowledge and bodies and facilitating governance, the
   wikification of mapping might facilitate a more mutable politics. This
   paper focuses on these possibilities by examining OpenStreetMap (OSM),
   arguably the most significant and emancipatory of neo-geographic
   assemblages. While not underplaying the importance of a political
   economic understanding of the Geoweb, it suggests we need to attend more
   to the contexts through which emergent knowledge communities enact
   alternatives, and that notions of practice are central in any evaluation
   of changing politics of representation. Communities involved in OSM
   contest the geographies that they call into being, and this process can
   be narrated through a consideration of local action, in different map
   spaces and places. A processual view of mapping reveals the extent of
   mutability of OSM, and highlights many of the tensions evident in
   collaborative remapping. New ways of mapping reciprocally create and
   reinforce newly expert knowledge communities that may be emancipatory,
   but that may also reify power relations. Crowd-sourced mapping is likely
   to comprise a hybrid of mutable and immutable elements.}},

Title = {{Mapping the data shadows of Hurricane Sandy: Uncovering the sociospatial
   dimensions of `big data'}},
Journal = {{GEOFORUM}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{52}},
Pages = {{167-179}},

Abstract = {{Digital social data are now practically ubiquitous, with increasingly
   large and interconnected databases leading researchers, politicians, and
   the private sector to focus on how such `big data' can allow potentially
   unprecedented insights into our world. This paper investigates Twitter
   activity in the wake of Hurricane Sandy in order to demonstrate the
   complex relationship between the material world and its digital
   representations. Through documenting the various spatial patterns of
   Sandy-related tweeting both within the New York metropolitan region and
   across the United States, we make a series of broader conceptual and
   methodological interventions into the nascent geographic literature on
   big data. Rather than focus on how these massive databases are causing
   necessary and irreversible shifts in the ways that knowledge is
   produced, we instead find it more productive to ask how small subsets of
   big data, especially georeferenced social media information scraped from
   the internet, can reveal the geographies of a range of social processes
   and practices. Utilizing both qualitative and quantitative methods, we
   can uncover broad spatial patterns within this data, as well as
   understand how this data reflects the lived experiences of the people
   creating it. We also seek to fill a conceptual lacuna in studies of
   user-generated geographic information, which have often avoided any
   explicit theorizing of sociospatial relations, by employing Jessop et
   al.'s TPSN framework. Through these interventions, we demonstrate that
   any analysis of user-generated geographic information must take into
   account the existence of more complex spatialities than the relatively
   simple spatial ontology implied by latitude and longitude coordinates.

Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},

Volume = {{258}},
Pages = {{312-327}},
Month = {{FEB 10}},
Abstract = {{The paper analyses the challenges and problems posed by the use of
   Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) in citizen science and a
   proposal is formulated for assessing VGI quality based on a linguistic
   decision making approach so as to allow its feasible use for scientific
   purposes.
   VGI quality is represented by indicators at distinct levels of
   granularity which take into account the distinct components of the VGI
   items. The quality indicators represent both the extrinsic quality,
   depending on the characteristics and reputation of the sources of
   information; the intrinsic quality, depending on the distinct accuracy
   and precision of information; and, last but not least, the pragmatic
   quality, depending on the user needs and intended purposes. In order to
   assess the pragmatic quality of VGI items, a linguistic decision making
   approach is defined that allows users to rank and finally filter the VGI
   items based on the satisfaction of distinct criteria expressed by means
   of both linguistic terms, defining soft constraints on the distinct
   quality indicators, and linguistic aggregators, defining fuzzy operators
   which combine the satisfaction degrees of the soft constraints at
   distinct hierarchical levels to yield the final satisfaction of the VGI
   items. Finally, an example of quality assessment in a glaciological
   citizen science project is discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Natural disasters like floods are a worldwide phenomenon and a serious
   threat to mankind. Flood simulations are applications of disaster
   control, which are used for the development of appropriate flood
   protection. Adequate simulations require not only the geometry but also
   the roughness of the Earth's surface, as well as the roughness of the
   objects hereon. Usually, the floodplain roughness is based on land
   use/land cover maps derived from orthophotos. This study analyses the
   applicability of roughness map derivation approaches for flood
   simulations based on different datasets: orthophotos, LiDAR data,
   official land use data, OpenStreetMap data and CORINE Land Cover data.
   Object-based image analysis is applied to orthophotos and LiDAR raster
   data in order to generate land cover maps, which enable a roughness
   parameterization. The vertical vegetation structure within the LiDAR
   point cloud is used to derive an additional floodplain roughness map.
   Further roughness maps are derived from official land use data,
   OpenStreetMap and CORINE Land Cover datasets. Six different flood
   simulations are applied based on one elevation data but with the
   different roughness maps. The results of the hydrodynamic- numerical
   models include information on flow velocity and water depth from which
   the additional attribute flood intensity is calculated of. The results
   based on roughness maps derived from LiDAR data and OpenStreetMap data
   are comparable, whereas the results of the other datasets differ
   significantly.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED GEOGRAPHY}},

Volume = {{47}},
Pages = {{70-77}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The generation of a routing network for disabled people inherits a
   number of prerequisites that need special consideration. Widespread
   routing applications that rely on commercial or governmental geodata
   sources are not feasible for this specific task, due to the lack of
   detailed information about features such as sidewalks, surface
   conditions or road incline. In recent years the research community has
   experienced a strong increase in studies related to routing applications
   tailored to disabled people in which the lack of a sophisticated dataset
   played a major role. This study proposes an algorithm for the generation
   of a disabled people friendly routing network, based on collaboratively
   collected geodata provided by the OpenStreetMap (OSM) project. This new
   representation of a routing graph can be used in numerous applications
   and maps dedicated to people with disabilities. The algorithm is tested
   and evaluated for selected areas in Europe, resulting in newly generated
   extended networks that include sidewalk information. The results have
   shown that the success of the final implementation of the introduced
   algorithm depends highly on the attribute quality of the OSM dataset.

Abstract = {{The term neogeography, which designates the proliferation of Web-based
   geographic information technologies and the parallel opening up of the
   mapping enterprise to nonexpert cartographers, gained traction in 2006.
   Implicit in the declaration of neogeography, however, is a
   trivialization of the geographic discipline. Academic geographers, who
   have never expressed affinity for the label neogeography, have worked to
   problematize the instrumentalist reductionism of the discipline to data
   and technics that such a branding presupposes. But as Wilson and Graham
   (2013b) recently argued, neogeographyor neo, geographyis as much a
   statement about newness as it is a commentary about the discipline.
   Geographers' emphasis on the geography part of the neo, geography
   equation, although warranted, has come at the expense of examining the
   equally important societal implications of the framing of recent spatial
   information technologies as always-already new. In this article, I
   foreground the neo in neo, geography and trace the ways in which the
   ascribed newness of emergent Web-based spatial media is leveraged in
   discursive-material practices that enact certain kinds of changes in the
   world. Drawing on illustrative empirical examples, I demonstrate the
   ways in which newness (1) acts as a discursive device that depoliticizes
   spatial media so as to lay the groundwork for their social
   naturalization; (2) is made recourse to as a means by which certain
   techno-capitalist actors disavow themselves of responsibility for the
   societal effects of these technologies; and (3) underwrites the model
   through which the proliferation and thereby profitability of
   location-based services is sustained.}},

Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Integrating heterogeneous spatial data is a crucial problem for
   geographical information systems (GIS) applications. Previous studies
   mainly focus on the matching of heterogeneous road networks or
   heterogeneous polygonal data sets. Few literatures attempt to approach
   the problem of integrating the point of interest (POI) from volunteered
   geographic information (VGI) and professional road networks from
   official mapping agencies. Hence, the article proposes an approach for
   integrating VGI POIs and professional road networks. The proposed method
   first generates a POI connectivity graph by mining the linear cluster
   patterns from POIs. Secondly, the matching nodes between the POI
   connectivity graph and the associated road network are fulfilled by
   probabilistic relaxation and refined by a vector median filtering (VMF).
   Finally, POIs are aligned to the road network by an affine
   transformation according to the matching nodes. Experiments demonstrate
   that the proposed method integrates both the POIs from VGI and the POIs
   from official mapping agencies with the associated road networks
   effectively and validly, providing a promising solution for enriching
   professional road networks by integrating VGI POIs.}},

Abstract = {{Geographies of codified knowledge have always been characterized by
   stark core-periphery patterns, with some parts of the world at the
   center of global voice and representation and many others invisible or
   unheard. Many have pointed to the potential for radical change, however,
   as digital divides are bridged and 2.5 billion people are now online.
   With a focus on Wikipedia, which is one of the world's most visible,
   most used, and most powerful repositories of user-generated content, we
   investigate whether we are now seeing fundamentally different patterns
   of knowledge production. Even though Wikipedia consists of a massive
   cloud of geographic information about millions of events and places
   around the globe put together by millions of hours of human labor, the
   encyclopedia remains characterized by uneven and clustered geographies:
   There is simply not a lot of content about much of the world. The
   article then moves to describe the factors that explain these patterns,
   showing that although just a few conditions can explain much of the
   variance in geographies of information, some parts of the world remain
   well below their expected values. These findings indicate that better
   connectivity is only a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the
   presence of volunteered geographic information about a place. We
   conclude by discussing the remaining social, economic, political,
   regulatory, and infrastructural barriers that continue to disadvantage
   many of the world's informational peripheries. The article ultimately
   shows that, despite many hopes that a democratization of connectivity
   will spur a concomitant democratization of information production,
   Internet connectivity is not a panacea and can only ever be one part of
   a broader strategy to deepen the informational layers of places.}},

Abstract = {{Arguably, there have been few shifts in the GISciences so paradigmatic

   in the US have witnessed these changes in just the last crop of PhD
   students, with topics on location-based services, the geoweb,

   earlier, trendy topics on web-based GIS and interactive digital
   cartography. Indeed, there are new important players in GISc, with
   training in and outside of Geography, with backgrounds as diverse as the
   engineering/computational sciences and the digital humanities as well as
   critical human geographies. Mobilities researchers, qualitative GIS
   scholars, cyberinfrastructural scientists, and social and cultural
   geographers have configured research programs around the proliferation
   of locationally-aware devices and the `big data' that have emerged from

Abstract = {{Collective intelligence is the idea that under the right circumstances
   collections of individuals are smarter than even the smartest
   individuals in the group, that is a group has an ``intelligence{''} that
   is independent of the intelligence of its members. The ideology of
   collective intelligence undergirds much of the enthusiasm about the use
   of ``volunteered{''} or crowd-sourced geographic information. Literature
   from a variety of fields makes clear that not all groups possess
   collective intelligence, this article identifies four pre-conditions for
   the emergence of collective intelligence and then examines the extent to
   which collectively generated mapping systems satisfy these conditions.
   However, the ``intelligence{''} collectively generated maps is hard to
   assess because there are two difficult to reconcile perspectives on map
   quality - the credibility perspective and the accuracy perspective. Much
   of the current literature on user-generated maps focuses on assessing
   the quality of individual contributions. However, because user-generated
   maps are complex social systems and because the quality of a
   contribution is difficult to assess this strategy may not yield an
   ``intelligent{''} end product. The existing literature on collective
   intelligence suggests that the structure of groups is more important
   than the intelligence of group members. Applying this idea to
   user-generated maps suggests that systems should be designed to foster
   conditions known to produce collective intelligence rather than
   privileging particular contributions/contributors. The article concludes
   with some design recommendations and by considering the implications of
   collectively generated maps for both expert knowledge and traditional
   state sponsored mapping programs.}},

Abstract = {{To a large degree, the attraction of Big Data lies in the variety of its
   heterogeneous multi-thematic and multi-dimensional data sources and not
   merely its volume. To fully exploit this variety, however, requires
   conflation. This is a two-step process. First, one has to establish
   identity relations between information entities across different data
   sources; and second, attribute values have to be merged according to
   certain procedures that avoid logical contradictions. The first step,
   also called matching, can be thought of as a weighted combination of
   common attributes according to some similarity measures. In this work,
   we propose such a matching based on multiple attributes of Points of
   Interest (POI) from the Location-based Social Network Foursquare and the
   local directory service Yelp. While both contain overlapping attributes
   that can be used for matching, they have specific strengths and
   weaknesses that make their conflation desirable. For instance,
   Foursquare offers information about user check-ins to places, while Yelp
   specializes in user-contributed reviews. We present a weighted
   multi-attribute matching strategy, evaluate its performance, and discuss
   application areas that benefit from a successful matching. Finally, we
   also outline how the established POI matches can be stored as Linked
   Data on the Semantic Web. Our strategy can automatically match 97\% of
   randomly selected Yelp POI to their corresponding Foursquare entities.}},

Abstract = {{Data on population at building level is required for various purposes.
   However, to protect privacy, government population data is aggregated.
   Population estimates at finer scales can be obtained through areal
   interpolation, a process where data from a first spatial unit system is
   transferred to another system. Areal interpolation can be conducted with
   ancillary data that guide the redistribution of population. For
   population estimation at the building level, common ancillary data
   include three-dimensional data on buildings, obtained through costly
   processes such as LiDAR. Meanwhile, volunteered geographic information
   (VGI) is emerging as a new category of data and is already used for
   purposes related to urban management. The objective of this paper is to
   present an alternative approach for building level areal interpolation
   that uses VGI as ancillary data. The proposed method integrates existing
   interpolation techniques, i.e., multi-class dasymetric mapping and
   interpolation by surface volume integration; data on building footprints
   and points-of-interest (POIs) extracted from OpenStreetMap (OSM) are
   used to refine population estimates at building level. A case study was
   conducted for the city of Hamburg and the results were compared using
   different types of POIs. The results suggest that VGI can be used to
   accurately estimate population distribution, but that further research
   is needed to understand how POIs can reveal population distribution
   patterns.}},

Abstract = {{A large number of applications have been launched to gather geo-located
   information from the public. This article introduces an approach toward
   generating land-use patterns from volunteered geographic information
   (VGI) without applying remote-sensing techniques and/or engaging
   official data. Hence, collaboratively collected OpenStreetMap (OSM) data
   sets are employed to map land-use patterns in Vienna, Austria. Initially
   the spatial pattern of the landscape was delineated and thereafter the
   most relevant land type was assigned to each land parcel through a
   hierarchical GIS-based decision tree approach. To evaluate the proposed
   approach, the results are compared with the Global Monitoring for
   Environment and Security Urban Atlas (GMESUA) data. The results are
   compared in two ways: first, the texture of the resulting land-use
   patterns is analyzed using texture-variability analysis. Second, the
   attributes assigned to each land segment are evaluated. The achieved
   land-use map shows kappa indices of 91, 79, and 76\% agreement for
   location in comparison with the GMESUA data set at three levels of
   classification. Furthermore, the attributes of the two data sets match
   at 81, 67, and 65\%. The results demonstrate that this approach opens a
   promising avenue to integrate freely available VGI to map land-use
   patterns for environmental planning purposes.}},

Abstract = {{Due to financial or administrative constraints, access to official
   spatial base data is currently limited to a small subset of all
   potential users in the field of spatial planning and research. This
   increases the usefulness of Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI), in
   particular OpenStreetMap (OSM), as supplementary datasets or, in some
   cases, alternative sources of primary data. In contrast to the OSM
   street network, which has already been thoroughly investigated and found
   to be practically complete in many areas, the degree of completeness of
   OSM data on buildings is still unclear. In this paper we describe
   methods to analyze building completeness and apply these to various test
   areas in Germany. Official data from national mapping and cadastral
   agencies is used as a basis for comparison. The results show that
   unit-based completeness measurements (e.g., total number or area of
   buildings) are highly sensitive to disparities in modeling between
   official data and VGI. Therefore, we recommend object-based methods to
   study the completeness of OSM building footprint data. An analysis from
   November 2011 in Germany indicated a completeness of 25\% in the federal
   states of North Rhine-Westphalia and 15\% in Saxony. Although further
   analyses from 2012 confirm that data completeness in Saxony has risen to
   23\%, the rate of new data input was slowing in the year 2012.}},

Abstract = {{Volunteered geographic information (VGI), or geospatial crowdsourcing,
   is where citizens (volunteers) contribute data and information about the

   sustainable option for use as a source of spatial information for
   pervasive computing technologies, particularly in areas where access to

   gained the interest of the geoscience community, because of its ability

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{44}},
Pages = {{1-11}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The management of multiple-use public lands such as national forests in
   the U.S. is controversial because of the wide range of potential uses
   and contested public values for these lands. Previous research on
   national forest values and management preferences examined these
   relationships non-spatially. The development of public participation GIS
   (PPGIS) and volunteered geographic information (VGI) systems provide new
   opportunities to assess spatial relationships between perceived national
   forest values and preferred uses. This research used empirical data
   collected from a PPGIS/VGI study for three national forests in
   California to examine spatial and non-spatial relationships between
   place-based forest values and preferred uses. The relationships suggest
   public participants translated some of their non-spatial forest values
   and preferences into behavioral choices when mapping place-specific
   values and preferred uses. The empirical relationships between
   place-based forest values and uses were generally consistent with
   previous survey research results. Positive, non-spatial attitudes toward
   extractive uses of national forests were correlated with participant
   mapping of economic values and related extractive uses, while
   nonmaterial forest attitudes were correlated with participant mapping of
   amenity values and conservation-related uses. Further, spatial
   preferences for extractive forest uses such as timber harvesting were
   mapped proximate to economic values, while nonmaterial spatial
   preferences were mapped proximate to amenity-related forest values.
   PPGIS offers the potential to translate philosophical and ideology-based
   national forest preferences into place-specific discourse about forest
   management activities where public accommodation may be more achievable.

Abstract = {{In recent years, a web phenomenon known as Volunteered Geographic
   Information (VGI) has produced large crowdsourced geographic data sets.
   OpenStreetMap (OSM), the leading VGI project, aims at building an
   open-content world map through user contributions. OSM semantics
   consists of a set of properties (called `tags') describing geographic
   classes, whose usage is defined by project contributors on a dedicated
   Wiki website. Because of its simple and open semantic structure, the OSM
   approach often results in noisy and ambiguous data, limiting its
   usability for analysis in information retrieval, recommender systems and
   data mining. Devising a mechanism for computing the semantic similarity
   of the OSM geographic classes can help alleviate this semantic gap. The
   contribution of this paper is twofold. It consists of (1) the
   development of the OSM Semantic Network by means of a web crawler
   tailored to the OSM Wiki website; this semantic network can be used to
   compute semantic similarity through co-citation measures, providing a
   novel semantic tool for OSM and GIS communities; (2) a study of the
   cognitive plausibility (i.e. the ability to replicate human judgement)
   of co-citation algorithms when applied to the computation of semantic
   similarity of geographic concepts. Empirical evidence supports the usage
   of co-citation algorithms-SimRank showing the highest plausibility-to
   compute concept similarity in a crowdsourced semantic network.}},

Abstract = {{Natural disasters such as earthquakes and tsunamis occur all over the
   world, altering the physical landscape and often severely disrupting
   people's daily lives. Recently researchers' attention has focused on
   using crowds of volunteers to help map the damaged infrastructure and
   devastation caused by natural disasters, such as those in Haiti and
   Pakistan. This data is extremely useful, as it is allows us to assess
   damage and thus aid the distribution of relief, but it tells us little
   about how the people in such areas will react to the devastation. This
   paper demonstrates a prototype spatially explicit agent-based model,
   created using crowdsourced geographic information and other sources of
   publicly available data, which can be used to study the aftermath of a
   catastrophic event. The specific case modelled here is the Haiti
   earthquake of January 2010. Crowdsourced data is used to build the
   initial populations of people affected by the event, to construct their
   environment, and to set their needs based on the damage to buildings. We
   explore how people react to the distribution of aid, as well as how
   rumours relating to aid availability propagate through the population.
   Such a model could potentially provide a link between socio-cultural
   information about the people affected and the relevant humanitarian
   relief organizations. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Several studies show the impacts of (geo)social media and Volunteered
   Geographic Information (VGI) during crisis events, and have found
   intrinsic value for rescue teams, relief workers and humanitarian
   assistance coordinators, as well as the affected population. The main
   challenge is how emergency management and the public can capitalize on
   the abundance of this new source of information by reducing the volume
   to credible and relevant content.
   In this paper, we present the GeoCONAVI (Geographic CONtext Analysis for
   Volunteered Information) approach and a prototype system, designed to
   retrieve, process, analyze and evaluate social media content on forest
   fires, producing relevant, credible and actionable VGI usable for crisis
   events. The novelty of the approach lies in the enrichment of the
   content with additional geographic context information, and use of
   spatio-temporal clustering to support scoring and validation. Thus, the
   system is focusing on integrating authoritative data sources with VGI.
   Evaluation in case studies shows that the prototype system can handle
   large amounts of data with common-off-the-shelf hardware, produces
   valuable results, and is adaptable to other types of crisis events. (C)

Abstract = {{European Alpine glaciology has a long tradition of studies and
   activities, in which researchers have often relied on the field work of
   some specialized volunteer operators. Despite the remarkable results of
   this cooperation, some problems in field data harmonization and in
   covering the whole range of monitored glaciers are still present.
   Moreover, dynamics of reduction, fragmentation and decline, which in
   recent decades characterize Alpine glaciers, make more urgent the need
   to improve spatial and temporal monitoring, still maintaining adequate
   quality standards. Scientific field monitoring activities on Alpine
   glaciers run parallel to a number of initiatives by individuals and
   amateur associations, keepers of alternative, experiential and
   para-scientific knowledge of the glacial environment. Problems of
   harmonization, coordination, recruitment and updating can be addressed
   with the help of a collaborative approach-citizen science-like-in which
   the scientific coordination guarantees information quality and web 2.0
   tools operate as mediators between expert glaciologists and non-expert
   contributors. This paper gives an overview of glaciological information
   currently produced in the European Alpine region, representing it in an
   organized structure, functional to the discussion. An empowering
   solution is then proposed, both methodological and technological, for
   the integration of multisource data. Its characteristics, potentials and

Abstract = {{The increasing availability of sensor devices has resulted in important
   volumes of sensor data, which has raised the issue of making these data
   fully discoverable and interpretable by applications and end-users. The
   idea of OGC Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) has addressed this issue by
   proposing a set of standards to enable accessibility of sensor data over
   the Web. Similarly, there is a growing interest in volunteered
   geographic information (VGI). Considering that several researchers have
   highlighted the potential of this new type of information as a
   complement to existing, ``traditional{''} data, it becomes important to
   develop frameworks to support the integration of VGI from several
   sources and with other types of data. In this paper, we make a first
   step in this direction by proposing a framework for the semantic
   interoperability of sensor data and VGI. After having performed an
   investigation of the types of VGI applications, we have developed a
   conceptual model of VGI aligned with relevant ISO standards for
   describing geospatial features. The purpose of this model is to support
   the generation of common descriptions for VGI applications, which will
   act as interfaces to higher-level services, such as discovery and
   reasoning services, in order to be exploited in conjunction with sensor
   data by client applications. This process is described through
   architecture for semantic interoperability of sensor data and VGI that
   we have developed and that we intend to use to set guidelines for future
   research on integration of VGI in sensor data cyberinfrastructures. We
   illustrate the possibilities created by the proposed framework with a
   description of the various services and interfaces required to implement
   the framework.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{23}},
Pages = {{37-48}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{There is much interest in using volunteered geographic information (VGI)
   in formal scientific analyses. This analysis uses VGI describing land
   cover that was captured using a web-based interface, linked to Google
   Earth. A number of control points, for which the land cover had been
   determined by experts allowed measures of the reliability of each
   volunteer in relation to each land cover class to be calculated.
   Geographically weighted kernels were used to estimate surfaces of
   volunteered land cover information accuracy and then to develop
   spatially distributed correspondences between the volunteer land cover
   class and land cover from 3 contemporary global datasets (GLC-2000,
   GlobCover and MODIS v.5). Specifically, a geographically weighted
   approach calculated local confusion matrices (correspondences) at each
   location in a central African study area and generated spatial
   distributions of user's, producer's, portmanteau, and partial
   portmanteau accuracies. These were used to evaluate the global datasets
   and to infer which of them was `best' at describing Tree cover at each
   location in the study area. The resulting maps show where specific
   global datasets are recommended for analyses requiring Tree cover
   information. The methods presented in this research suggest that some of
   the concerns about the quality of VGI can be addressed through careful
   data collection, the use of control points to evaluate volunteer
   performance and spatially explicit analyses. A research agenda for the
   use and analysis of VGI about land cover is outlined. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{There is currently a lack of in-situ environmental data for the
   calibration and validation of remotely sensed products and for the
   development and verification of models. Crowdsourcing is increasingly
   being seen as one potentially powerful way of increasing the supply of
   in-situ data but there are a number of concerns over the subsequent use
   of the data, in particular over data quality. This paper examined
   crowdsourced data from the Geo-Wiki crowdsourcing tool for land cover
   validation to determine whether there were significant differences in
   quality between the answers provided by experts and non-experts in the
   domain of remote sensing and therefore the extent to which crowdsourced
   data describing human impact and land cover can be used in further
   scientific research. The results showed that there was little difference
   between experts and non-experts in identifying human impact although
   results varied by land cover while experts were better than non-experts
   in identifying the land cover type. This suggests the need to create
   training materials with more examples in those areas where difficulties
   in identification were encountered, and to offer some method for
   contributors to reflect on the information they contribute, perhaps by
   feeding back the evaluations of their contributed data or by making
   additional training materials available. Accuracies were also found to
   be higher when the volunteers were more consistent in their responses at
   a given location and when they indicated higher confidence, which
   suggests that these additional pieces of information could be used in
   the development of robust measures of quality in the future.}},

   producer's accuracy of forest and of forest extent derived from the free
   and volunteered data using a latent class model were of comparable
   magnitude to those derived in a formal validation by experts; the
   estimate of forest extent was within 1.38-9.08\% of reference estimates

Abstract = {{The assessment of the quality and accuracy of Volunteered Geographic
   Information (VGI) contributions, and by extension the ultimate utility
   of VGI data has fostered much debate within the geographic community.
   The limited research to date has been focused on VGI data of linear
   features and has shown that the error in the data is heterogeneously
   distributed. Some have argued that data produced by numerous
   contributors will produce a more accurate product than an individual and
   some research on crowd-sourced initiatives has shown that to be true,
   although research on VGI is more infrequent. This paper proposes a
   method for quantifying the completeness and accuracy of a select subset

   whether the OSM road network should be updated through periodic data

   US Census TIGER/Line 2005 import into OSM was accomplished in early
   2008, which generated a road network foundation for the active community
   members in the US. In this study we perform a longitudinal analysis of

   data since the initial TIGER/Line import. The analysis is performed for
   the 50 US states and the District of Columbia, and 70 Urbanized Areas.
   In almost all tested states and Urbanized Areas, OSM misses roads for

Abstract = {{With the increased availability of user generated data, assessing the
   quality and credibility of such data becomes important. In this article,
   we propose to assess the location correctness of visually generated
   Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) as a quality reference measure.
   The location correctness is determined by checking the visibility of the
   point of interest from the position of the visually generated VGI
   (observer point); as an example we utilize Flickr photographs. Therefore
   we first collect all Flickr photographs that conform to a certain point
   of interest through their textual labelling. Then we conduct a reverse
   viewshed analysis for the point of interest to determine if it lies
   within the area of visibility of the observer points. If the point of
   interest lies outside the visibility of a given observer point, the
   respective geotagged image is considered to be incorrectly geotagged. In
   this way, we analyze sample datasets of photographs and make
   observations regarding the dependency of certain user/photo metadata and
   (in)correct geotags and labels. In future the dependency relationship
   between the location correctness and user/photo metadata can be used to
   automatically infer user credibility. In other words, attributes such as
   profile completeness, together with location correctness, can serve as a
   weighted score to assess credibility.}},

Abstract = {{The vision of a Digital Earth calls for more dynamic information
   systems, new sources of information, and stronger capabilities for their
   integration. Sensor networks have been identified as a major information
   source for the Digital Earth, while Semantic Web technologies have been
   proposed to facilitate integration. So far, sensor data are stored and
   published using the Observations \& Measurements standard of the Open
   Geospatial Consortium (OGC) as data model. With the advent of
   Volunteered Geographic Information and the Semantic Sensor Web, work on
   an ontological model gained importance within Sensor Web Enablement
   (SWE). In contrast to data models, an ontological approach abstracts
   from implementation details by focusing on modeling the physical world
   from the perspective of a particular domain. Ontologies restrict the
   interpretation of vocabularies toward their intended meaning. The
   ongoing paradigm shift to Linked Sensor Data complements this attempt.
   Two questions have to be addressed: (1) how to refer to changing and
   frequently updated data sets using Uniform Resource Identifiers, and (2)
   how to establish meaningful links between those data sets, that is,
   observations, sensors, features of interest, and observed properties? In
   this paper, we present a Linked Data model and a RESTful proxy for OGC's
   Sensor Observation Service to improve integration and inter-linkage of
   observation data for the Digital Earth.}},

Abstract = {{About one decade has passed since US vice president Al Gore articulated
   his vision of Digital Earth (DE). Within this decade, a global
   multi-resolution and three-dimensional (3D) representation of the Earth,
   which sums up the DE vision, increasingly gained interest in both public
   and science. Due to the desired high resolution of the available data,
   highly detailed 3D city models comprise a huge part of DE and they are
   becoming an essential and useful tool for a range of different
   applications. In the past as well as at present, 3D models normally come
   from a range of different sources generated by professionals, such as
   laser scans or photogrammetry combined with 2D cadaster data. Some
   models are generated with semi-automated or fully automated approaches,
   but in most cases manual fine tuning or even manual construction from
   architectural plans is required. Further beyond outdoor city models, DE
   additionally envisages the provision of indoor information. That is, the
   interior structure of public or publically accessible buildings, such as
   airports or shopping malls, is represented and made available in 3D;
   however, at the moment, such models are mostly created by hand and
   essentially based on professional data sources. In contrast to such
   professional data, which is mainly captured by surveyors or companies,
   the last few years revealed the phenomenon of crowdsourced geodata,
   which receives an increasing attractiveness as an alternative data
   source for many Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Former research
   already demonstrated the power and richness of such geodata especially
   OpenStreetMap (OSM) and it has also been proved that this
   non-standardized, crowdsourced geodata can be combined with
   international standards of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). For
   example, CityGML Level-of-Detail 1 (LoD1) and LoD2 models have already
   been created automatically from OSM. The research presented in this
   article will further continue on the automated generation of CityGML
   models from OpenStreetMap. Essentially, a method for the creation of
   highly detailed CityGML LoD4 models with interior structures will be
   explained. By applying the invented approach on existing OSM data,
   limitations and restrictions of the IndoorOSM mapping proposal, the
   available data and the developed approach are revealed and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes the digital dimensions of places as represented by

   experiences of the city. These digital layers are invisible to the naked
   eye, but form a central component of the augmentations and mediations of
   place enabled by hundreds of millions of mobile computing devices and
   other digital technologies. The analysis highlights how these
   augmentations of place differ across space and language and highlights
   both the differences and some of the causal factors behind them. This is
   performed through a global study of all online content indexed within
   Google Maps, and more specific analyses of the linguistically and
   topically segregated layers of information over four selected places.
   The uneven linguistic geographies that this study reveals undoubtedly
   influence the many ways in which place is enacted and brought into
   being. The larger aim of this project is to use these initial mappings
   of the linguistic contours of the geoweb to push forward a broader

   How can the OSM project protect itself against data vandalism? To be
   able to give a sophisticated answer to this question, different cases of

   for the project by the end of 2011. However, while this number of
   contributors seems impressive, questions remain about the individual
   contributions that have been made by the project members. This research
   article contains several studies regarding the contributions by the
   community of the project. The results show that only 38\% (192,000) of
   the registered members carried out at least one edit in the OSM database
   and that only 5\% (24,000) of all members actively contributed to the
   project in a more productive way. The majority of the members are
   located in Europe (72\%) and each member has an activity area whose size
   may range from one soccer field up to more than 50 km(2). In addition to
   several more analyses conducted for this article, predictions will be
   made about how this newly acquired knowledge can be used for future

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{1}},

Pages = {{186-208}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Crowdsourced geodata has been proven to be a rich and major data source
   for environmental simulations and analysis, as well as the visualization
   of spatial phenomena. With the increasing size and complexity of public
   buildings, such as universities or hotels, there is also an increasing
   demand for information about indoor spaces. Trying to stimulate this
   growing demand, both researchers and Volunteered Geographic Information
   (VGI) communities envision to extend established communities towards
   indoors. It has already been showcased that VGI from OpenStreetMap (OSM)
   can be utilized for different applications in Spatial Data
   Infrastructures (SDIs) as well as for simple shortest path computations
   inside buildings. The here presented research now tries to utilize
   crowdsourced indoor geodata for more complex indoor routing scenarios of
   multiple users. Essentially, it will be investigated if, and to what
   extent, the available data can be utilized for performing indoor
   evacuation simulations with the simulation framework MATSim. That is,
   this paper investigates the suitability of crowdsourced indoor
   information from OSM (IndoorOSM) for evacuation simulations.
   Additionally, the applicability of MATSim for agent-based indoor
   evacuation simulations is conducted. The paper discusses the automatic
   generation simulation-related data, and provides experimental results
   for two different evacuation scenarios. Furthermore, limitations of the
   IndoorOSM data and the MATSim framework for indoor evacuation
   simulations are elaborated and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents one of the first systematic usability
   investigations for a Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) editor.
   This research is motivated by the fact that although VGI is now widely
   consumed, contribution rates are lagging considerably. Compared to
   traditional GIS interfaces, with complex interfaces resulting in high
   cognitive loads and barriers to participation, VGI tools and interfaces
   need to be easy to use and learn to encourage and facilitate
   contributions. This article develops a case study of OpenStreetMap, one
   of the most successful VGI projects, and its default editor, Potlatch2.
   Ten participants with no prior experience of VGI contribution, were
   instructed to contribute data to OSM in a structured exercise, while
   being monitored using an eye tracker and audio/video screen capture
   software. Each participant was asked to Think Aloud, i.e. describe what
   they were thinking and doing as they completed the tasks. The results
   highlight significant usability issues impacting learnability,
   especially from the perspective of a new contributor: hidden
   functionality, lack of user feedback between interactions and the
   inefficient and inconsistent placement of functionality and map
   controls. The facilitation of VGI contributions clearly depends on
   designing targeted interfaces, optimized to the needs of specific levels
   of contributors with defined goals and expectations.}},

Abstract = {{New, free and fast growing spatial data sources have appeared online,

   is one of the most representative projects of this trend. Its increasing

   be meaningful, and is usually performed manually at the data preparation
   stage. This article proposes an automated feature-based matching method
   specifically designed for VGI, based on a multi-stage approach that
   combines geometric and attribute constraints. It is applied to the OSM

Abstract = {{Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) has the potential to offer

   framework of information relevance was used to understand the attributes
   of information that were most important in relation to the
   characteristics of the users' activity and their community. The key
   finding was that the discussion amongst GIS designers should not be
   whether to choose VGI or PGI as the information data set, but to
   consider which combination of VGI and PGI relating to different
   geographic features and task characteristics would best meet the users'
   needs. VGI is likely to be most relevant to the user when a geographic
   feature is dynamic rather than static in nature, and can also provide a
   level of detail that is unlikely to arise through PGI. These findings
   have implications for how different forms of information are most

Abstract = {{What make citizens participate in mapping projects? What motivates them
   to get involved in a non-hierarchical network of individuals who

   participate in cadastral mapping as an alternative way to speed up the
   cadastral survey and minimise the costs and errors which rise when
   traditional procedures allow limited owners' participation? The answers
   are still ambiguous. However, it is a fact that the way geospatial data

   dramatically during the last years. The paper briefly gives an
   introduction on the evolution of Neogeography and the citizens'
   involvement in spatial data collection, editing and uploading on the

Abstract = {{Disabled people, especially the blind and vision-impaired, are
   challenged by many transitory hazards in urban environments such as
   construction barricades, temporary fencing across walkways, and
   obstacles along curbs. These hazards present a problem for navigation,
   because they typically appear in an unplanned manner and are seldom
   included in databases used for accessibility mapping. Tactile maps are a
   traditional tool used by blind and vision-impaired people for navigation
   through urban environments, but such maps are not automatically updated
   with transitory hazards. As an alternative approach to static content on
   tactile maps, we use volunteered geographic information (VGI) and an
   Open Source system to provide updates of local infrastructure. These VGI
   updates, contributed via voice, text message, and e-mail, use geographic
   descriptions containing place names to describe changes to the local
   environment. After they have been contributed and stored in a database,
   we georeference VGI updates with a detailed gazetteer of local place
   names including buildings, administrative offices, landmarks, roadways,
   and dormitories. We publish maps and alerts showing transitory hazards,
   including location-based alerts delivered to mobile devices. Our system
   is built with several technologies including PHP, JavaScript, AJAX,
   Google Maps API, PostgreSQL, an Open Source database, and PostGIS, the
   PostgreSQL's spatial extension. This article provides insight into the

   types of users (from targeted citizen-based observation networks,
   expert-driven focused monitoring, and opportunistic crowdsourcing
   efforts) in monitoring a forest disease in the western United States. We
   first introduce the overall challenge of data collection in
   environmental monitoring projects and then discuss the literature
   surrounding an emergent integration of citizen science and volunteered
   geographical information. We next explore how these methods characterize
   and underpin knowledge discovery and how multimodal interaction is
   supported so that a large spectrum of contributors can be included.
   These concepts are summarized in a conceptual model that articulates the
   important gradients of Web-based environmental monitoring: the users,
   the interaction between users and data, and the types of information
   generated. Using this model, we critically examine OakMapper.org, a Web
   site created by the authors to collect and distribute spatial
   information related to the spread of a forest disease, and discuss many
   of the core issues and new challenges presented by the intersection of
   citizen science and volunteered geographic information in the context of

Abstract = {{The convergence of newly interactive Web-based technologies with growing
   practices of user-generated content disseminated on the Internet is
   generating a remarkable new form of geographic information. Citizens are
   using handheld devices to collect geographic information and contribute
   it to crowd-sourced data sets, using Web-based mapping interfaces to
   mark and annotate geographic features, or adding geographic location to
   photographs, text, and other media shared online. These phenomena, which
   generate what we refer to collectively as volunteered geographic
   information (VGI), represent a paradigmatic shift in how geographic
   information is created and shared and by whom, as well as its content
   and characteristics. This article, which draws on our recently completed
   inventory of VGI initiatives, is intended to frame the crucial
   dimensions of VGI for geography and geographers, with an eye toward
   identifying its potential in our field, as well as the most pressing
   research needed to realize this potential. Drawing on our ongoing
   research, we examine the content and characteristics of VGI, the
   technical and social processes through which it is produced, appropriate
   methods for synthesizing and using these data in research, and emerging
   social and political concerns related to this new form of information.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{215-229}},
Abstract = {{Scaling of geographic space refers to the fact that for a large
   geographic area its small constituents or units are much more common
   than the large ones. This article develops a novel perspective to the
   scaling of geographic space using large street networks involving both
   cities and countryside. Given a street network of an entire country, we
   decompose the street network into individual blocks, each of which forms
   a minimum ring or cycle such as city blocks and field blocks. The block
   sizes demonstrate the scaling property, that is, far more small blocks
   than large ones. Interestingly, we find that the mean of all the block
   sizes can easily separate between small and large blocks -a high
   percentage (e.g., 90\%) of smaller ones and a low percentage (e.g.,
   10\%) of larger ones. Based on this regularity, termed as the head/tail
   division rule, we propose an approach to delineating city boundaries by
   grouping the smaller blocks. The extracted city sizes for the three
   largest European countries (France, Germany, and United Kingdom) exhibit
   power law distributions. We further define the concept of border number
   as a topological distance of a block far from the outmost border to map
   the center(s) of the country and the city. We draw an analogy between a
   country (or a city or geographic space in general) and a complex
   organism like the human body or the human brain to further elaborate on
   the power of this block perspective in reflecting the structure or
   patterns of geographic space.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1437-1456}},
Abstract = {{One difficulty in integrating geospatial data sets from different
   sources is variation in feature classification and semantic content of
   the data. One step towards achieving beneficial semantic
   interoperability is to assess the semantic similarity among objects that
   are categorised within data sets. This article focuses on measuring
   semantic and structural similarities between categories of formal data,
   such as Ordnance Survey (OS) cartographic data, and volunteered
   geographic information (VGI), such as that sourced from OpenStreetMap
   (OSM), with the intention of assessing possible integration. The model
   involves `tokenisation' to search for common roots of words, and the
   feature classifications have been modelled as an XML schema labelled
   rooted tree for hierarchical analysis. The semantic similarity was
   measured using the WordNet::Similarity package, while the structural
   similarities between sub-trees of the source and target schemas have
   also been considered. Along with dictionary and structural matching, the
   data type of the category itself is a comparison variable. The overall
   similarity is based on a weighted combination of these three measures.
   The results reveal that the use of a generic similarity matching system
   leads to poor agreement between the semantics of OS and OSM data sets.
   It is concluded that a more rigorous peer-to-peer assessment of VGI
   data, increasing numbers and transparency of contributors, the
   initiation of more programs of quality testing and the development of
   more directed ontologies can improve spatial data integration.}},

Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{Geocoding urban addresses usually requires the use of an underlying
   address database. Under the influence of the format defined for TIGER
   files decades ago, most address databases and street geocoding
   algorithms are organized around street centerlines, associating
   numbering ranges to thoroughfare segments between two street crossings.
   While this method has been successfully employed in the USA for a long
   time, its transposition to other countries may lead to increased errors.
   This article presents an evaluation of the centerline-geocoding
   resources provided by Google Maps, as compared to the point-geocoding
   method used in the city of Belo Horizonte, Brazil, which we took as a
   baseline. We generated a textual address for each point object found in
   the city's point-based address database, and submitted it to the Google
   Maps geocoding API. We then compared the resulting coordinates with the
   ones recorded in Belo Horizonte's GIS. We demonstrate that the
   centerline segment interpolation method, employed by the online
   resources following the American practice, has problems that can
   considerably influence the quality of the geocoding outcome.
   Completeness and accuracy have been found to be irregular, especially
   within lower income areas. Such errors in online services can have a
   significant impact on geocoding efforts related to social applications,
   such as public health and education, since the online service can be
   faulty and error-prone in the most socially demanding areas of the city.
   In the conclusion, we point out that a volunteered geographic
   information (VGI) approach can help with the enrichment and enhancement
   of current geocoding resources, and can possibly lead to their
   transformation into more reliable point-based geocoding services.}},

Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1115-1122}},

Abstract = {{Landscape scenery is inherently difficult to conceptualize because of
   its perceptual nature. Yet landscapes are an extremely important
   resource for tourism and quality of life so there is a need to classify
   and manage landscapes. This paper shows how viewshed analysis based on
   the known location and direction of a photo can be used to tag a photo
   and this provides a method for assessing the New Zealand Landscape
   Classification. GIS visibility and overlay functions are combined with
   digital elevation data and a landscape classification to produce the
   tagged photos. This tool links an oblique view with multiple distance
   perspectives to a GIS dataset. There are complexities associated with
   distance perspectives and the appropriate balance of foreground and
   distant landscape. This paper argues that the benefits of automated
   tagging of landscape photos are threefold. The process of modelling
   landscape tags forces researchers to confront the complexity of
   landscape character classification. This in turn leads to improved
   methods for representing and classifying landscape character. Secondly,
   once tagging methods have been developed then people may choose to use
   these tools rather than to manually tag photos. Thirdly, such a tool
   provides the opportunity to utilize the increasingly important
   volunteered geographic information on the Internet for understanding
   landscape categories. Landscape photographs and associated tags on the
   Internet provide insight about landscape categories employed by the
   public. This could lead to the development of what is labelled ``tag
   clouds{''} and a landscape ``folksonomy{''}. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Do local landmark bridges increase the suicide rate? An alternative test

Journal = {{SOCIAL SCIENCE \& MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{6}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{A number of recent studies have examined the effect of installing
   physical barriers or otherwise restricting access to public sites that
   are frequently used for suicides by jumping. While these studies
   demonstrate that barriers lead to a reduction in the number of suicides
   by jumping at the site where they are installed, thus far no study has
   found a statistically significant reduction in the local suicide rate
   attributable to a barrier. All previous studies are case studies of
   particular sites, and thus have limited statistical power and ability to
   control for confounding factors, which may obscure the true relationship
   between barriers and the suicide rate. This study addresses these
   concerns by examining the relationship between large, well-known bridges
   ({''}local landmark{''} bridges) of the type that are often used as
   suicide-jumping sites and the local suicide rate, an approach that
   yields many more cases for analysis. If barriers at suicide-jumping
   sites decrease the local suicide rate, then this implies that the
   presence of an unsecured suicide-jumping site will lead to a higher
   local suicide rate in comparison to areas without such a site. The
   relationship between suicides and local landmark bridges is examined
   across 3116 US counties or county equivalents with negative binomial
   regression models. I found that while exposure to local landmark bridges
   was associated with an increased number of suicides by jumping, no
   positive relationship between these bridges and the overall number of
   suicides was detected. It may be impossible to conclusively determine if
   barriers at suicide-jumping sites reduce the local suicide rate with
   currently available data. However, the method introduced in this paper
   offers the possibility that better data, or an improved understanding of
   which potential jumping sites attract suicidal individuals, may
   eventually allow researchers to determine if means restriction at
   suicide-jumping sites reduces total suicides. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Volume = {{42}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{6-15}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Blogging, social networking, and other Web 2.0 practices have sparked
   widespread debate about the status and future of privacy. This paper
   examines an explicitly geographical aspect of Web 2.0 with respect to
   these debates: the geospatial web, or `geoweb'. As part of fundamental
   shifts in the kinds of geographic information available, its
   circulation, and representative forms it assumes, the geoweb implies new
   objects of privacy concern and subsequent privacy-related negotiations
   over the aggregate of its component information, technologies, and data
   praxes. Thus we argue that privacy must not only be revisited, but
   indeed re-conceptualized. Whereas prior research on privacy vis--vis
   geographic information technologies has tended to question what privacy
   `is', we focus instead on the constitutive outcomes of societal
   struggles over privacy. We examine how privacy is being negotiated
   around two geoweb services - Google Street View and the Twitter GeoAPI -
   to illustrate that these contestations produce privacy as a social
   object in particular ways. We show that public discourse around actual
   or anticipated privacy harms stemming from geoweb services and their
   uses, as well as the preventatives and remedies proposed or implemented
   to address such harms, reconstitute the objects and practices of privacy
   concern, and alter the roles and relationships of state, civil and
   corporate actors in the construction of privacy. Finally we suggest that
   the geoweb raises new privacy concerns because some of its
   representational forms - namely geo-tagged images and self-authored
   texts - facilitate identification and disclosure with more immediacy and
   less abstraction. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Availability of a transit service is a key factor in a traveler's choice

   network that includes pedestrian segments, that is, shortcuts, is highly
   important for a realistic assessment of service areas. Whereas most
   proprietary geodata providers concentrate solely on car-related geodata,
   public domain street data and volunteered geographic information, such
   as OpenStreetMap, provide a potential valuable source for pedestrian
   data. The authors compared the amount of pedestrian-related data between
   freely available sources (OpenStreetMap or TIGER or both) and
   proprietary providers (Tele Atlas or NAVTEQ or both). The effect on
   modeling transit accessibility for pedestrians was analyzed for five
   U.S. and four German cities, and differences between these two countries
   were identified.}},

Abstract = {{The amateur birding community has a long and proud tradition of
   contributing to bird surveys and bird atlases. Coordinated activities
   such as Breeding Bird Atlases and the Christmas Bird Count are examples
   of ``citizen science{''} projects. With the advent of technology, Web
   2.0 sites such as eBird have been developed to facilitate online sharing
   of data and thus increase the potential for real-time monitoring.
   However, as recently articulated in an editorial in this journal and
   elsewhere, monitoring is best served when based on a priori hypotheses.
   Harnessing citizen scientists to collect data following a
   hypothetico-deductive approach carries challenges. Moreover, the use of
   citizen science in scientific and monitoring studies has raised issues
   of data accuracy and quality. These issues are compounded when data
   collection moves into the Web 2.0 world. An examination of the
   literature from social geography on the concept of ``citizen sensors{''}
   and volunteered geographic information (VGI) yields thoughtful
   reflections on the challenges of data quality/data accuracy when
   applying information from citizen sensors to research and management
   questions. VGI has been harnessed in a number of contexts, including for
   environmental and ecological monitoring activities. Here, I argue that
   conceptualizing a monitoring project as an experiment following the
   scientific method can further contribute to the use of VGI. I show how
   principles of experimental design can be applied to monitoring projects
   to better control for data quality of VGI. This includes suggestions for
   how citizen sensors can be harnessed to address issues of experimental
   controls and how to design monitoring projects to increase randomization
   and replication of sampled data, hence increasing scientific reliability
   and statistical power.}},

Abstract = {{In the area of volunteered geographical information (VGI), the issue of
   spatial data quality is a clear challenge. The data that are contributed
   to VGI projects do not comply with standard spatial data quality
   assurance procedures, and the contributors operate without central
   coordination and strict data collection frameworks. However, similar to
   the area of open source software development, it is suggested that the
   data hold an intrinsic quality assurance measure through the analysis of
   the number of contributors who have worked on a given spatial unit. The
   assumption that as the number of contributors increases so does the
   quality is known as `Linus' Law' within the open source community. This
   paper describes three studies that were carried out to evaluate this
   hypothesis for VGI using the OpenStreetMap dataset, showing that this
   rule indeed applies in the case of positional accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) has recently
   emerged from the new Web 2.0 technologies. The OpenStreetMap project is
   currently the most significant example of a system based on VGI. It aims

   studies the quality of French OpenStreetMap data. It extends the work of
   Haklay to France, provides a larger set of spatial data quality element
   assessments (i.e. geometric, attribute, semantic and temporal accuracy,
   logical consistency, completeness, lineage, and usage), and uses
   different methods of quality control. The outcome of the study raises
   questions such as the heterogeneity of processes, scales of production,
   and the compliance to standardized and accepted specifications. In order
   to improve data quality, a balance has to be struck between the
   contributors' freedom and their respect of specifications. The
   development of appropriate solutions to provide this balance is an
   important research issue in the domain of user-generated content.}},

   a literature on the more fundamental issues raised by this new source.
   Data quality is a major concern, since volunteered information is

   risks associated with volunteered information are often outweighed by
   the benefits of its use. An example is discussed using the four

Abstract = {{Digital Earth (DE) is a powerful metaphor for the organisation and
   access to digital information through a multi-scale three-dimensional
   representation of the globe. Recent progress gave a concrete body to
   this vision. However, this body is not yet self-aware: further
   integration of the temporal and voluntary dimension is needed to better
   portray the event-based nature of our world. We thus aim to extend DE
   vision with a Nervous System in order to provide decision makers with
   improved alerting mechanisms. Practical applications are foreseen for
   crisis management, where up-to-date situational awareness is needed.
   While it is traditionally built through trusted sources, citizens can
   play a complementary role by providing geo-referenced information known
   as Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI). Although workflows have
   been implemented to create, validate and distribute VGI datasets for
   various thematic domains, its exploitation in real time and its
   integration into existing concepts of DE, such as spatial data
   infrastructures, still needs to be further addressed. In this paper we
   suggest to bridge this gap through Sensor Web Enablement for VGI, where
   VGI sensing becomes a sense of the DE's Nervous System. We discuss this
   approach and its applicability in the context of a forest fire scenario.}},

Abstract = {{Incorporating the temporal element into traditional GIS is a challenge
   that has been researched for many years and has many proposed solutions.
   The implemented system ``Extended Dynamic GIS{''} or EDGIS is based on
   the ``geo-atom{''} and Space Time Point (STP). EDGIS provides a platform
   for spatiotemporal data representation, storage, and query in order to
   address the need for a dynamic GIS to manage complex geographic data
   types. The system has the capability of executing spatiotemporal object
   interaction queries (OIQs) such as crossing and coincidence of
   field-objects and object-fields. In this article existing dynamic GIS
   analysis techniques are further improved and enhanced through
   exploration of more in-depth case studies. Further examined here are
   applications to wildfire evacuation modeling and travel scenarios of
   urban environments with individuals providing volunteered geographic
   information (VGI). The EDGIS platform provides a means for interacting
   with a range of dynamic geographic phenomena. The areas of
   transportation, location based services (LBS), hazards, and geo-sensor
   networks provide challenges intertwined with the above applications as
   well as additional challenges pertinent to the ongoing GIScience
   research topic of spatiotemporal GIS. Using EDGIS to explore the
   described case studies of wildfire evacuation as well as VGI provides
   the advancements described above and demonstrates implemented uses for
