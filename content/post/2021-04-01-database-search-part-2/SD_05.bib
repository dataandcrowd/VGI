abstract = {Advancements in citizen sensing and geospatial big data have enabled new opportunities for government-citizen interactions and have played important roles in developing smart(er) cities. In addition to city governments and citizens actively using maps to communicate spatial planning issues, the increasing capabilities of citizens generating spatial data either actively or passively allow city governments to collect local spatial knowledge with unprecedented breadth at finer spatiotemporal resolutions. New methods for citizens collaborating with city governments are also emerging to enhance citizen engagement and to spur social innovation. By synthesizing recent advancements in geo-enabled citizen participation, this paper proposed a new typology for classifying and characterizing concepts and practices related to geospatial technology-mediated public participation in local governments (e.g. city and municipal governments). Practical examples are used to illustrate how new dynamics between local governments and citizens are formed, new methods of collecting local spatial knowledge are enabled, and new opportunities for improving the openness and operational efficiency of local governments have emerged. The proposed conceptualization and examples give rise to emerging needs of advancing geo-participation by developing geospatial methods and infrastructure and by investigating the social and spatial implications of geo-participation.}

Supporting and regulatory ecosystem services in coastal areas have received considerable research attention given human vulnerability to climate change, but cultural ecosystem services in the coastal zone are less understood. This study describes and analyzes the distribution of cultural ecosystem values found in coastal areas in multiple countries (n = 5) and compares the results with non-coastal areas. Mapped cultural ecosystem values were collected from public participation GIS (PPGIS) processes in the U.S., Australia, New Zealand, Norway, and Malaysia and analyzed to identify the type and intensity of ecosystem values located in coastal areas. Mapped ecosystem values were significantly more abundant in all coastal zones, regardless of ecosystem value category, country, population, or dominant land use. Compared to cultural ecosystem values, biological and life-sustaining values were mapped less frequently in the coastal zone. Economic and social values were significantly associated with developed (built) coastal zones, while aesthetic and recreation values were more strongly associated with natural coastal zones. Coastal access, especially by road, influences the mix of perceived values from nature-based values to anthropocentric values. Coastal zones will continue to be the principle location for potential future land use conflict given their high social and cultural value relative to other ecological values. Understanding trade-offs in coastal zone planning and management requires a systematic inventory of the full range of ecosystem services, including cultural services.}

However, designing technology for such purpose places unique visualization challenges that go beyond the current state of research on public participation tools and related technologies. Empowering these communities requires developing representations that enable collaborative reflection, promote mutual visibility of volunteers’ efforts and sustain a shared view of the community. Similarly, it is necessary to envision visualizations that facilitate sense making of large, simultaneous and distributed pieces of heterogeneous information with different levels of credibility and priority. Accordingly, this paper identifies and characterizes these challenges to propose a multi-view and multi-abstraction-level visualization approach for emergency communities of volunteers. In particular, it combines time-oriented visualizations, space-filling visualization techniques, interaction mechanisms and coordinated maps to support community participation as well as collaborative and individual sense making. The application of these visualization techniques is discussed through the development of a set of design prototypes.}

Stakeholders representing multiple interests are presumed to hold different management preferences for these lands. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate how stakeholder perspectives can influence place-based management preferences for public lands. We developed a multi-dimensional public land preference scale and used cluster analysis of responses to classify individuals (n=1507) into stakeholder groups using data collected from a large public participation GIS (PPGIS) survey in Victoria, Australia. We analyzed the results of the two largest stakeholder groups (identified as “Preservation” and “Recreation”) to assess their spatial preferences for public land conservation, access, and development. We developed a method to assess the level of spatial stakeholder agreement, with the results identifying geographic areas of both agreement and disagreement between stakeholder groups. To determine the effects of unequal stakeholder participation in mapping, we performed sensitivity analysis by weighting the responses of the Recreation stakeholder group to approximate the mapping effort of the Preservation stakeholder group. The place-based management preferences changed significantly for conservation/development and improving/limiting public land access, while preferences for increasing/limiting facility development were less sensitive to stakeholder weighting. The spatial mapping of stakeholder preferences appears effective for identifying locations with high potential for conflict as well as areas of agreement, but would benefit from further research in a range of land management applications to provide further guidance on the analysis of stakeholder group responses that result from diverse stakeholder group participation.}

The Data Poverty Index (DPI) provides an open-source means of annually evaluating global access to data and information. The DPI can be used to monitor aspects of data and information availability at global and national levels, with potential application at local (district) levels. Access to data and information is a major factor in disaster risk reduction, increased resilience to disaster and improved adaptation to climate change. In that context, the DPI could be a useful tool for monitoring the Sustainable Development Goals of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015–2030). The effects of severe data poverty, particularly limited access to geoinformatic data, free software and online training materials, are discussed in the context of sustainable development and disaster risk reduction. Unlike many other indices, the DPI is underpinned by datasets that are consistently provided annually for almost all the countries of the world and can be downloaded without restriction or cost.}

Defining the public interest for marine and coastal areas remains a wicked problem, however, resistant to resolution. A focus on more tangible ‘public values’ offers an alternative for policy and planning in specific contexts. However, ambiguity surrounds who or what constitutes the ‘public’, with stakeholder engagement often used as a proxy in marine and coastal research. In this study, the outcomes of participatory processes involving the public from diverse backgrounds and geographical locales were explored. A public participation GIS (PPGIS) survey was undertaken in the remote Kimberley region of Australia to identify the spatial values and management preferences for marine and coastal areas. Similarities and differences between the volunteer public (n = 372) and online panel respondents (n = 206); and for the volunteer public only, differences between residents (n = 118) and non-residents (n = 254) were assessed. Online panelists evidenced lesser quality mapping data and did not provide a reliable means of accessing ‘public’ values. Residents were more likely to map general recreational and recreational fishing values while non-locals were more likely to map biological/conservation and wilderness values. Overall, residents and non-residents were more alike than dissimilar in their mapping of values and management preferences, suggesting that the need to preference local views may be overstated, although there may be differences in policy priorities. Future research should focus on the breadth and representativeness of stakeholder interests to access the views of wider society and hence public values, rather than current approaches where local interests are often the primary focus of participatory stakeholder engagement.}

Currently, 54% of the world's population lives in cities, and an increase of 66% is expected by 2050. Based on the World Urbanisation Prospects' report, most of this growth is projected to concentrate in Asia and Africa. The resulting uncontrolled urbanisation can lead to many issues with profound impacts on health, poverty, and social inequality. Monitoring our global landscapes in the most rapidly growing regions particularly in the global south becomes thus an important endeavour. The estimation of future urban patterns become thus part of important topics that foresight the necessary support systems that efficiently cope with the carrying capacity of these urban regions. In this sense, this paper aims to i) monitor historical land cover changes in one of such major cities - Maputo, Mozambique, and, ii) project future patterns of urban fabric in its metropolitan region. To achieve this, satellite imagery from Landsat between 2000 and 2015 was collected and classified using a maximum likelihood algorithm. Spatiotemporal monitoring of urban settlements showed that within the proposed temporal scope, massive urban development took place while depleting a substantial amount of other land use types. Based on this spatiotemporal cognisance, a customized cellular automaton (CA) model was built that embeds the trends of changes while predicting future patterns. Our predictions exposed a significant amount of urbanisation will evolve over the next years if no significant controlling mechanism to cope with rapid urbanisation is integrated. Our findings, as well as conclusions, aim to aid local urban planners and policy makers in the course of urban planning in the region while taking advantage of novel open source methodologies that offer cost reduction and enable efficient monitoring for large urban extents.}

abstract = {Summary
Background
Surgical, anaesthetic, and obstetric (SAO) health-care system strengthening is needed to address the emergency and essential surgical care that approximately 5 billion individuals lack globally. To our knowledge, a complete, non-modelled national situational analysis based on the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery surgical indicators has not been done. We aimed to undertake a complete situation analysis of SAO system preparedness, service delivery, and financial risk protection using the core surgical indicators proposed by the Commission in Colombia, an upper-middle-income country.
Methods
Data to inform the six core surgical system indicators were abstracted from the Colombian national health information system and the most recent national health survey done in 2007. Geographical access to a Bellwether hospital (defined as a hospital capable of providing essential and emergency surgery) within 2 h was assessed by determining 2 h drive time boundaries around Bellwether facilities and the population within and outside these boundaries. Physical 2 h access to a Bellwether was determined by the presence of a motor vehicle suitable for individual transportation. The Department Administrativo Nacional de Estadística population projection for 2016 and 2018 was used to calculate the SAO provider density. Total operative volume was calculated for 2016 and expressed nationally per 100 000 population. The total number of postoperative deaths that occurred within 30 days of a procedure was divided by the total operative volume to calculate the all-cause, non-risk-adjusted postoperative mortality. The proportion of the population subject to impoverishing costs was calculated by subtracting the baseline number of impoverished individuals from those who fell below the poverty line once out-of-pocket payments were accounted for. Individuals who incurred out-of-pocket payments that were more than 10% of their annual household income were considered to have experienced catastrophic expenditure. Using GIS mapping, SAO system preparedness, service delivery, and cost protection were also contextualised by socioeconomic status.
Findings
In 2016, at least 7·1 million people (15·1% of the population) in Colombia did not have geographical access to SAO services within a 2 h driving distance. SAO provider density falls short of the Commission's minimum target of 20 providers per 100 000 population, at an estimated density of 13·7 essential SAO health-care providers per 100 000 population in 2018. Lower socioeconomic status of a municipality, as indicated by proportion of people enrolled in the subsidised insurance regime, was associated with a smaller proportion of the population in the municipality being within 2 h of a Bellwether facility, and the most socioeconomically disadvantaged municipalities often had no SAO providers. Furthermore, Colombian providers appear to be working at or beyond capacity, doing 2690–3090 procedures per 100 000 population annually, but they have maintained a relatively low median postoperative mortality of 0·74% (IQR 0·48–0·84). Finally, out-of-pocket expenses for indirect health-care costs were a key barrier to accessing surgical care, prompting 3·1 million (6·4% of the population) individuals to become impoverished and 9·5 million (19·4% of the population) individuals to incur catastrophic expenditures in 2007.
Interpretation
We did a non-modelled, indicator-based situation analysis of the Colombian SAO system, finding that it has not yet met, but is working towards achieving, the targets set by the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery. The observed interdependence of these indicators and correlation with socioeconomic status are consistent with well recognised factors and outcomes of social, health, and health-care inequity. The internal consistency observed in Colombia's situation analysis validates the use of the indicators and has now informed development of an early national SAO plan in Colombia, to set a data-informed stage for implementation and evaluation of timely, safe, and affordable SAO health care, within the National Public Health Decennial Plan, which is due in 2022.

This paper discusses the role of sensed transportation, geographic information science and social media to cultivate transportation systems where participants share, cooperate and act collectively to solve operational, tactical and strategic mobility and accessibility problems. This paper also provides a vision of the future by imaging a seamless multimodal transportation system combined with a virtual environment where data streams are fused, interpreted and made available with tools for human engagement and shared decision making.

Such analytical capacity at the knowledge system level facilitates transparency and credibility needed for nation-states to cooperate on issues requiring global coordination, including “super-wicked” environmental issues like climate change. So far there has been relatively sparse attention paid to whether countries will have the ability – or policy analytical capacity – to report the necessary data and indicators required for the next round of global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) being proposed. In this paper, I argue that the varied policy analytical capacity within the global environmental knowledge system necessitates the participation of new institutions and actors. Identifying gaps in data availability at a global, systemic scale, this paper presents a proxy measure of policy analytical capacity based on publicly-reported national statistics of air and water quality performance. Such discrepancies evaluated at a systemic level make a case for channels by which citizen scientists, independent watchdogs, private sector companies and third-party organizations can participate to enhance the policy analytical capacity of governments.}

The study of these values transcends mere physical attributes of the landscape and requires assessment of its social meaning. In recent years the usage of social media has gained momentum to study the aesthetic preferences and perception of the environment. However, until now the different approaches have not yet been sufficiently combined to provide more in depth understanding of what attracts people in the landscape We propose a robust methodology using social media photos from Flickr and Panoramio to estimate the correlation between landscape attributes and landscape preferences. We combine formal modeling of spatial photo distribution based on the occurrence of landscape elements with content analysis of the photos to pinpoint what it is in a landscape that attracts people. We use the Kromme Rijn Area –a peri-urban area in the center of the Netherlands and a popular recreation area- as case study area. The analysis shows that this area is appreciated by its visitors and residents for the presence of monumental buildings, small water bodies and opportunities for hikes along grasslands. The method successfully linked the structural elements of the landscape with the revealed preferences, providing a way of quantifying the appreciation of the landscape. Qualitative surveys remain essential to study motivations for outdoor recreation, but social media data can be incorporated as evidence of what elements of the landscape are valued, where people are interacting with the landscape, and how these interactions characterize a landscape.}

Such an approach overlooks several important inter-relationships among the largely different integrated components of cultural ES, i.e. recreational, spiritual, education concerns, etc. In this paper, the need of more explicit typologies is underscored via a case study, where the authors represented the discrepancies between two tiers of Cultural ES: those associated with Spiritual Values and Recreational Opportunities using a socio-georaphically-based tri-indicator analytical framework. More specifically, two survey-based (Richness and Quality of ES), and one GIS-based (Willingness to Travel (WTT)) indices were proposed to evaluate a full range of cultural benefits derived from seven popular tourism sites of Ha Tien Town, Kien Giang, Vietnam. These numerical indicators pointed out the significant differences between ritual values and recreational based benefits, underlining the crucial need of fuller taxonomies of cultural services within the ES analytical framework. With respect to the study area, the measurements of Quality and Richness detected major synergies and tradeoffs among the evaluated benefits, supporting the need to balance management between developing tourism activities and preserving cultural identity of the landscapes. The last indicator, WTT utilizes map data from OpenStreetMap to produce an objective metric in evaluating landscape quality, taking into account the frequency and the potential costs in traveling to respective sites. This indicator constitutes a reliable and equitable method to represent relevant Cultural ES of landscapes besides the popular yet controversial money-based indices, e.g. Willingness to Pay or Willingness to Accept.}

The heterogeneous geography of broadband infrastructure and investments results in variable service provision, and as such, there exist large disparities in access and performance within different spatio-temporal locations. This paper presents analysis of 4.7 million crowdsourced Internet speed test results that were compiled between 2010 and 2013 alongside various indicators of socio-spatial structure to map disparities in English broadband speed between and within urban areas. Although average speeds have improved over time, inequity is shown to emerge between different societal groups and locations. Short-term dynamics also reveal that in areas of different density, speeds can fall dramatically during peak hours, thus influencing the availability of services. The apparent disparities in access and performance represent a major issue as Internet use becomes increasingly ubiquitous in our everyday lives, with inequalities evoking social and economic disadvantage at local and national scales. This work resonates with UK government policy that has stimulated considerable investment in improving infrastructure, and presents analysis of an expansive crowd sourced “big data” resource for the first time.}

With the rise of big data era, there are more and more available data could be utilized for this topic. In this chapter, the article introduces a set of newly emerged methods to analyze the spatial distribution of human activity using social media data to identify where is the most vibrant place in the city. Using Twitter data in Chicago downtown as an example, this chapter will discuss how to collect social media data, how to visualize the data and how to identify the most vibrant region in the city using it. The process is replicable for the most area in the world as long as the social media service is viable, therefore provide the urban analysts a new tool to have a better understanding of the city.}

abstract = {Being human embodies understandings of space and spatial relationships which are embedded within the material world and are underpinned by complex frameworks of knowledge and experience. Just as this applied to people living in the past, so it applies to those of us concerned with trying to understand those past lives through the archaeological record. Most, if not all, archaeological material has a spatial component and it is not surprising, therefore, that spatial thinking has been central within archaeological endeavour since the beginnings of the discipline. Specific forms of spatial thinking have changed with developing theory and methods and with changing analytical and technological opportunities resulting in the rich variety of approaches available to us today. Within this development, the rapid adoption of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology since the early 1990s has had a major impact on archaeology and related disciplines and its use is now almost taken for granted. Although the use of GIS in archaeology has always been, and still is contentious at the theoretical level, the attractions of the technology are usually seen to outweigh any restrictions or disadvantages. In this paper we situate the use of GIS, including the papers in this volume, within the wider arena of spatial thinking in archaeology in an attempt to assess the impact that this technology has had on how we think spatially.}

Furthermore, our disaster relief system identifies an efficient distribution of supplies between hospitals and rescue centers and rescue demand points. By leveraging the temporal dimension of the social media data, our framework manages to iteratively optimize the disaster relief distribution.}

In addition, there has also been progression from small pilot studies to large data collection Earth Science citizen science initiatives that are used to underpin modelling. However, despite this, numerous operational and strategic challenges exist and whilst the awareness of citizen science has improved markedly, it is clear that the direct impact of citizen science on policy and decision making is still limited. Within this paper, we review these challenges alongside defining citizen science itself, and its benefits. The range of methods and applications of citizen science are explored through a series of case studies centred on geohazards, observations & classification, multi-topic, and education/outreach.

Earlier studies assessed air pollution exposure according to travel time and city-level air pollution. The lack of spatially fine-grained travel data is a barrier to an accurate assessment of air pollution exposure. Due to a high-level spatial granularity, Strava Metro provides an opportunity to assessing air pollution exposure in combination with spatially varying air pollution concentrations. Strava Metro anonymized and aggregated a large volume of users’ traces to streets for each city. In this study, to explore the potential of crowdsourced geographic information in research of active travel and health, we used Strava Metro data and GIS technologies to assess air pollution exposure in Glasgow, UK. Particularly, we incorporated time of the trip to assess average inhaled dose of pollutant during a single cycling or pedestrian trip. Empirical results demonstrate that Strava Metro data provides an opportunity to an assessment of average air pollution exposure during active travel. Additionally, to demonstrate the potential of Strava Metro data in policy-making, we explored the spatial association of air pollution concentration and active travel. As a result, we identified areas that require investment priority, and finally offered implications for policies.}

Our work addresses these threats, particularly within the European Union (EU), where a related legal framework has been established. We follow an open and participatory approach that allows more people to share their experiences of invasive alien species (IAS) in their surroundings. Over the past three years, we developed a mobile phone application, together with the underlying data management and validation infrastructure, which allows smartphone users to report a selected list of IAS. We put quality assurance and data integration mechanisms into place that allows the uptake of information into existing official systems in order to make it accessible to the relevant policy-making at EU level. This article summarises our scientific methodology and technical approach, explains our decisions, and provides an outlook to the future of IAS monitoring involving citizens and utilising the latest technological advancements. Last but not least we emphasise on software design for reuse, within the domain of IAS monitoring, but also for supporting citizen science apps more generally. Whereas much could already be achieved, many scientific, technical and organizational challenges still remain to be addressed before data can be seamlessly shared and integrated. Here, we particularly highlight issues that emerge in an international setting, which involves many different stakeholders.}

Machine learning algorithms may enable the use of increasingly available ‘big data’ and assist applying ecosystem service models across scales, analysing and predicting the flows of these services to disaggregated beneficiaries. We use the Weka and ARIES software to produce two examples of DDM: firewood use in South Africa and biodiversity value in Sicily, respectively. Our South African example demonstrates that DDM (64–91% accuracy) can identify the areas where firewood use is within the top quartile with comparable accuracy as conventional modelling techniques (54–77% accuracy). The Sicilian example highlights how DDM can be made more accessible to decision makers, who show both capacity and willingness to engage with uncertainty information. Uncertainty estimates, produced as part of the DDM process, allow decision makers to determine what level of uncertainty is acceptable to them and to use their own expertise for potentially contentious decisions. We conclude that DDM has a clear role to play when modelling ecosystem services, helping produce interdisciplinary models and holistic solutions to complex socio-ecological issues.}

With GPS technology and wireless communication technology maturing and their cost decreasing, floating car technology has been used in traffic monitoring and management, and the dynamic positioning data from floating cars become a new data source for updating road maps. In this paper, we aim to update digital road maps using the floating car data from China's National Commercial Vehicle Monitoring Platform, and present an incremental road network extraction method suitable for the platform's GPS data whose sampling frequency is low and which cover a large area. Based on both spatial and semantic relationships between a trajectory point and its associated road segment, the method classifies each trajectory point, and then merges every trajectory point into the candidate road network through the adding or modifying process according to its type. The road network is gradually updated until all trajectories have been processed. Finally, this method is applied in the updating process of major roads in North China and the experimental results reveal that it can accurately derive geometric information of roads under various scenes. This paper provides a highly-efficient, low-cost approach to update digital road maps.}

The 2016 Wuhan flood in the center of China utilized observations of non-scientists' from Internet media to capture the spatial distribution of urban flooding. Various sources in online news, blogs, bbs, and governmental websites were included. Independent flood-related factors such as rainfall, wetlands degradation, elevation, land use and land cover, curvature, slope, and normalized difference vegetation index were integrated into a logistic regression model to produce a susceptibility map. The feasibility and accuracy of this model was evaluated via comparison with official inundation maps and shortcomings of previous drainage system design. The accuracy assessment by receiver operating characteristics curve analysis estimated a success rate of 95.4%. This result shows that the data from mainstream media and public observations provide accurate and comparable information on flood occurrence at the urban scale. The assessment can be used to plan and design preventative drainage strategies for decision-makers. Finally, the limitations of Internet media as a new data resource for flooding risk assessment and future directions are discussed.}

The activities associated with the enormously intensified global connectivity have resulted in large amounts of data being generated, which in turn provides opportunities for generating knowledge that will allow more effective management of animal and human health risks. This so-called Big Data has, more recently, been accompanied by the Internet of Things which highlights the increasing presence of a wide range of sensors, interconnected via the Internet. Analysis of this data needs to exploit its complexity, accommodate variation in data quality and should take advantage of its spatial and temporal dimensions, where available. Apart from the development of hardware technologies and networking/communication infrastructure, it is necessary to develop appropriate data management tools that make this data accessible for analysis. This includes relational databases, geographical information systems and most recently, cloud-based data storage such as Hadoop distributed file systems. While the development in analytical methodologies has not quite caught up with the data deluge, important advances have been made in a number of areas, including spatial and temporal data analysis where the spectrum of analytical methods ranges from visualisation and exploratory analysis, to modelling. While there used to be a primary focus on statistical science in terms of methodological development for data analysis, the newly emerged discipline of data science is a reflection of the challenges presented by the need to integrate diverse data sources and exploit them using novel data- and knowledge-driven modelling methods while simultaneously recognising the value of quantitative as well as qualitative analytical approaches. Machine learning regression methods, which are more robust and can handle large datasets faster than classical regression approaches, are now also used to analyse spatial and spatio-temporal data. Multi-criteria decision analysis methods have gained greater acceptance, due in part, to the need to increasingly combine data from diverse sources including published scientific information and expert opinion in an attempt to fill important knowledge gaps. The opportunities for more effective prevention, detection and control of animal health threats arising from these developments are immense, but not without risks given the different types, and much higher frequency, of biases associated with these data.}

This paper reports on one strand of research being carried out as part of the EU FP7 TURAS project (Transitioning to Urban Resilience and Sustainability) that aims to gain insight into the implications of social-ecological resilience thinking on urban planning practice and policy by presenting a unique, trans-disciplinary perspective that has been developed collaboratively between academic, local government and SME partners. A framework for adaptive co-management and design is introduced as a basis for the operationalisation of urban resilience, highlighting the need to actively solve problems collaboratively by exercising imagination and creativity, and presenting a new and potentially fertile source for innovation. Five experiments exploring urban planning practices relating to the framework are put forward as examples of urban resilience in practice: an online crowd-sourcing application for mapping underused spaces; an interactive timeline tool for identifying drivers of change over time; a guidance and signposting tool to help community projects overcome resource barriers; an epistemic network of citizens that exchanges knowledge and resources relating to underused spaces; and an online portal that provides visibility for community groups or projects, and facilitates horizontal networking. The paper describes each experiment, sets out the aims and theoretical contexts, records any initial findings, and reflects on the potential and limitations. Initial findings are discussed relating to the challenges of crowd-sourcing spatial or historical data, and the resource commitment required for the emerging practices. It is observed that the experiments attempt to address fundamental issues in urban planning practice and policy, and involve established and familiar activities. The paper concludes that the research provides insight into what urban resilience might mean in practice and that each experiment has the potential to make a tangible contribution to the transition to urban resilience and sustainability.}

If authoritative data is scarce, or unavailable for some periods, other sources of information are required to improve streamflow estimation and early flood warnings. Georeferenced social media messages are increasingly being regarded as an alternative source of information for coping with flood risks. However, existing studies have mostly concentrated on the links between geo-social media activity and flooded areas. Thus, there is still a gap in research with regard to the use of social media as a proxy for rainfall-runoff estimations and flood forecasting. To address this, we propose using a transformation function that creates a proxy variable for rainfall by analysing geo-social media messages and rainfall measurements from authoritative sources, which are later incorporated within a hydrological model for streamflow estimation. We found that the combined use of official rainfall values with the social media proxy variable as input for the Probability Distributed Model (PDM), improved streamflow simulations for flood monitoring. The combination of authoritative sources and transformed geo-social media data during flood events achieved a 71% degree of accuracy and a 29% underestimation rate in a comparison made with real streamflow measurements. This is a significant improvement on the respective values of 39% and 58%, achieved when only authoritative data were used for the modelling. This result is clear evidence of the potential use of derived geo-social media data as a proxy for environmental variables for improving flood early-warning systems.}

Using the threatened koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) as a case study, we demonstrate a novel, socio-ecological approach for identifying conservation opportunity that spatially connects landscapes with community preferences to prioritize koala recovery strategies at a regional scale. We conceptualize conservation opportunity as the spatial integration of three sustainability criteria—ecological potential, social acceptability, and economic feasibility. The social acceptability criterion was assessed using a crowdsourced spatial survey that identified spatial preferences for koalas and land uses that impact koala conservation. As a novel approach, we addressed important research questions regarding the design, collection, and analysis of crowdsourced mapping data for identifying socially acceptable conservation opportunities. Public preferences for koalas were mapped closer to home, in higher suitable koala habitats than expected, were more pronounced in conservation and natural areas on public lands, and were mapped less frequently in modified agricultural landscapes. When the multiple criteria (ecological, social, and economic) were included in the conservation assessment, we found the social acceptability criterion exerted the greatest influence on spatial conservation priorities. The systematic assessment of social criteria for conservation using spatial surveys provides information that can be integrated with ecological information to prioritize conservation opportunities. Potential enhancements include expanding survey recruitment efforts and using alternative social data collection methods to achieve greater geographic and socio-demographic representation, and augmenting the economic feasibility assessment with private property values and transaction data from voluntary conservation agreements with private landowners.}

Interactions within their context lead to the establishment of groups that function at the intersection of the physical and cyber spaces, and as such represent hybrid communities. Gaining a better understanding of how information flows in these hybrid communities is a substantial scientific challenge with significant implications on our ability to better harness crowd-contributed content. This paper addresses this challenge by studying how information propagates and evolves over time at the intersection of the physical and cyber spaces. By analyzing the spatial footprint, social network structure, and content in both physical and cyber spaces we advance our understanding of the information propagation mechanisms in social media. The utility of this approach is demonstrated in two real-world case studies, the first reflecting a planned event (the Occupy Wall Street – OWS – movement’s Day of Action in November 2011), and the second reflecting an unexpected disaster (the Boston Marathon bombing in April 2013). Our findings highlight the intricate nature of the propagation and evolution of information both within and across cyber and physical spaces, as well as the role of hybrid networks in the exchange of information between these spaces.}

In recent years, research has shown a growing interest in information from geolocated digital footprints created by users of social networks, particularly on the Twitter microblogging platform. This form of social media allows users to create and exchange information in short messages, sometimes accompanied by photographs, videos, or other media. For the researcher, Twitter offers two advantages: the principle of communication is based on the diffusion of short and concise messages; in addition, the company Twitter is freely made available to any Internet user, by opening an account on the platform and a few lines of code, some of the content broadcast daily, via different APIs2. A decade of scientific work has developed a wide spectrum of fields of interest and disciplines involved: the first publications relating to the use of Twitter appeared the year after the platform was launched and focused on the observation of the microblog as a social phenomenon: it was then a question of understanding the construction of user networks, and the reasons that engage them in a process of using and adopting these tools in their daily lives.}

abstract = {Introduction
The existing healthcare-services-related literature tends to examine accessibility under a single travel mode, and measurement approaches are remaining limited for several inherent deficiency. This paper proposed a methodological enhancement of the three-step floating catchment area approach.
Methods
First, we incorporates real-time travel time and trip distance of private car and public transport obtained from open-source route planning API into model, which aims to differentiate the impact of multiple travel costs on spatial accessibility outcomes; next, an arithmetic mean-based Gaussian weight algorithm was introduced for achieve stable accessibility index; then, exploratory factor analysis was further employed to evaluate healthcare capacity, with the total score as the healthcare supply indicator to calculate the provider-to-population ratios; finally, an empirical study was conducted to verify the model’s advantages. We investigate accessibility to three tiers of healthcare facilities (including 22 tertiary hospitals, 88 secondary hospitals, and 55 community healthcare centres), and reveal disparities between supply and demand, via conjoint analysis of the accessibility of facilities and the population density under four associate patterns in the district of Wuhan at community scale (total 830 communities). Results: The results suggest that in terms of travel modes, the travel time and trip distance under the private car mode are shorter than these calculated under the public transport mode. Highly accessible communities are more concentrated in the central urban areas and distributed near a healthcare service centre, and community healthcare center have the greatest accessibility among the three tiers of healthcare. Moreover, statistical analysis highlights that distinct polarized differentiation appears in the number of communities with low and high accessibility, and more than half of the communities have accessibility levels that are inappropriate for their population size.
Conclusions
These findings may have important policy implications for health planners and decision-makers who must reasonably allocate public health resources.}

I mobilize affect as both a theoretical framework and an analytic to engage with geolocation as an instrumentality of intensities that organizes affects for platforms, which I term ‘platform affects’. I theorize platform affects as individual and collective orientations of attunement, predisposition, and/or incentivization towards using, contributing to, remaining within, and/or returning to platforms. Drawing on select empirical examples identified as part of a qualitative study, I identify that geolocation organizes five ‘platform affects’ for digital platform ecosystems: (i) affective space-times of hyperlocality and real-timeness; (ii) experiential affects of smoothness; (iii) affects of connectedness; (iv) affects of trust; and (v) affective value. Theorizing geolocation affectively adds explanatory power to the “dynamics driving the integration” of geolocation and digital systems (Alvaren León, 2016, p. 1). Simultaneously, engaging platforms via affects (of geolocation) advances an understanding of the ways in which platforms have come to secure and sustain prominence within dominant contemporary socialities defined by configurations of bodies, technologies, and other materialities that are themselves captured within and expressed through theories of affect (Clough, 2007).}

This paper proposes a method for integrating crowdsourced datasets and traditional datasets to measure dynamic information of land parcels and applies a presence and background data machine learning (PBL) model to assess the redevelopment suitability in mass. The work focuses on the study area of Shenzhen, a high-density urban context with an adequate amount of urban renewal cases and sufficient crowdsourced data. Results indicated that assessments based on the combination of crowdsourced datasets and traditional datasets were accurate and reliable for the residential and commercial land parcels. Furthermore, mass assessments at a fine spatial-temporal scale are viable if introduce crowdsourced datasets due to the cost of obtaining the crowdsourced data is much lower, and the spatial-temporal scale is much finer than investigated or surveyed data.}

The assumption that VGI is inferior to PGI is shown to be unfounded; rather each has its own strengths in describing particular aspects of the user information landscape. Considering the opportunities to influence user activities, both VGI and PGI have a greater ability to influence the user in the planning phase than actually during the activity. The importance of the author of the information (volunteer or professional) is shown to be of less importance to the end-user than the characteristics which describe the information in terms of communication, frequency of updates and accessibility.}

Additionally, the GISciences are being called to rearticulate their research agendas in the face of ‘big data’ and neogeography. This paper examines these developments with regard to criticality, or the ways in which mapping practices are applied in critical research – both research that seeks to situate the emergence of geospatial technologies and enrolls these technologies more directly as method. What is the criticality of mapping practices amid these developments? More specifically to the design and planning fields, how might geodesign align with critical GIS? I take up these questions by tracing three presuppositions of criticality in mapping while examining the conditions of geodesign's emergence: representation and futurity, neutrality and efficacy, and relationality and complexity. I conclude by outlining a research agenda for further advancement of a critical geodesign.}

abstract = {The eastern Helan Mountains are one of the most important plantings and production bases for high-quality grapes in China. In winter, grape root is prone to freezing damage owing to natural phenomenon such as early and late frost, and methods to assess disaster risk at the grape parcel level is one of the current research hotspots. However, there are two problems at present; first is the lack of grape parcel maps and second is that scale of disaster risk assessment is limited to the level of administrative divisions and grid systems. Therefore, according to the perennial characteristics of the grapes and clear texture of the open-air grape parcels based on public data sets (Sentinel-2A/B) and high-quality winery address information, combined with Google Earth engine (GEE) platform, Google Earth, and Ovitalmap, this study designs a collection scheme of open-air grape parcel samples and non-grape parcel samples, analyzes the environmental characteristics of the distribution of high-quality wineries, constructs a classification feature database in three aspects (time, terrain, and vegetation), uses the random forest classification method to classify open-air grape parcels in the eastern Helan Mountains in 2019, and conducts a late frost disaster risk assessment of the open-air grape parcel. The results show that: (1) The high-quality wineries are mainly distributed in the elevation of 1106–1240 m, with the average slope of 0.82°, the organic matter content of 10.79–14.27 g/kg, the P content of 24.87–37.58 mg/kg, the K content of 116–166 mg/kg, the pH 8.38–8.55, N content of 0.65–0.98 g/kg, annual average active accumulated temperature ≥10 °C of 3490–3590 °C, annual average rainfall of 189–201 mm, the annual average sunshine duration of 7.3–7.6 h, annual average air temperature of 8.8–9.4 °C, annual average temperature difference of 12.7–13.2 °C, annual average frost-free period at 263–270 d and annual average relative air Humidity of 50–54%. (2) The overall classification accuracy of open-air grape parcels reached 98.96% and the verification accuracy of ground truth parcel samples reached 87.89%. The open-air grape parcels in the eastern Helan Mountains are mainly distributed in Helan County, Xixia District, Yongning County, and Qingtongxia City. (3) The highest risk of late frost was found in Xixia District and the lowest risk in Yongning County. Helan County was higher than Qingtongxia City in the medium risk of late frost. The typical small area high risk includes Liangtian Town, the experimental field of Ningxia Academy of Agricultural and Forestry Sciences in Zhenbeibao Town, Yuhuang Winery in Ganchengzi Village, and the State-run Warm Spring Farm in Helan County. Thus, the sample collection and augmentation scheme are feasible, the open-air grape classification accuracy is high and its result is consistent with field investigation, which can provide accurate parcel-level disaster risk assessment and provide decision support for agricultural departments and farmers.}

Such values are culturally specific, and frequently difficult to measure and monetarize. The standard methodology to assess CES is through social surveys, though these are often costly, lack standardization and are geographically restricted. An alternative to surveys is to use information from social media. Here, we propose a novel salience index to quantify and compare CES provision for multiple user groups (local residents, researchers and visitors) of Catimbau National Park in Brazil using data derived from distinct methodologies: i) a traditional social survey; ii) an online survey, and iii) analysis of photos published on Flickr and Instagram. Our index allowed direct comparison between groups despite the data being collected using different approaches. As predicted, residents identified more locations providing CES and a higher overall diversity of CES. Correspondingly, researchers and visitors identified CES from a more restricted set of locations and were biased towards educational services and aesthetic value, respectively. Since multi-stakeholder, multi-method approaches are essential for a comprehensive understanding of CES, integrating results using standardized metrics such as our salience index will allow broad scale analysis of this poorly quantified class of ecosystem services.}

Three regression models, ordinary least squares regression, support vector machine, and random forest, were all calibrated using Landsat TM/ETM+ data and field observations from two sources: Environment Canada and the Weather Underground. Results based on cross-validation indicate that the random forest model produced the lowest prediction errors (RMSE=2.31°C). Some weather stations were consistently cooler/hotter than the reference station and were predicted well, while other stations, particularly those close to the ocean, showed greater temperature variability and were predicted with greater errors. A few stations, most of which were from the Weather Underground data set, were very poorly predicted and possibly unrepresentative of air temperature in the area. The random forest model generally produced a sensible map of temperature distribution in the area. The spatial regression approach appears useful for mapping intra-urban air temperature variability and can easily be applied to other cities.}

However, automatic generation of such models for high-density (HD) urban areas remains a challenge owing to (a) complex topographic conditions and noisy data irrelevant to the buildings, and (b) exponentially growing computational complexity when the task is reconstructing hundreds of buildings at an urban scale. This paper develops a method - multi-Source recTification of gEometric Primitives (mSTEP) - for automatic reconstruction of BIMs in HD urban areas. By retrieving building base, height, and footprint geodata from topographic maps, level of detail 1 (LoD1) BIMs representing buildings with flat roof configuration were first constructed. Geometric primitives were then detected from LiDAR point clouds and rectified using architectural knowledge about building geometries (e.g. a rooftop object would normally be in parallel with the outer edge of the roof). Finally, the rectified primitives were used to refine the LoD1 BIMs to LoD2, which show detailed geometric features of roofs and rooftop objects. A total of 1361 buildings located in a four square kilometer area of Hong Kong Island were selected as the subjects for this study. The evaluation results show that mSTEP is an efficient BIM reconstruction method that can significantly improve the level of automation and decrease the computation time. mSTEP is also well applicable to point clouds of various densities. The research is thus of profound significance; other cities and districts around the world can easily adopt mSTEP to reconstruct their own BIMs/CIMs to support their smart city programs.}

One of the dimensions that most suffered from excessive pressure, and is albeit all very little assessed, is the regional spatial change in line with historical and archaeological heritage. Monitoring of these transitions is of utmost importance to guide best the directions of regional planning in future. I advance with explaining the crucial role that Geographic Information Systems can play for regional science in line with heritage, and define techniques for sounder interactions of urban areas and regions in line with complex representation of space. I conclude further, that we are witnessing different types of dynamics in the landscape settings, that can be defined as (i) the coherent landscape, (ii) the dominant landscape and (iii) the vertical landscape lagging under a concept defined as spatial memory of rapid changing regions. All together, a new paradigm where geodesign, spatial analysis and geocomputational advances are linked, regional science must consider a new paradigm which I designate as regional intelligence for a more sustainable future.}

abstract = {Artificial intelligence and satellites have brought spatial-image interpretation to the forefront. Over the past two decades, the literature has provided three distinct methods for identifying and classifying the boundary of raster objects: the digital Jordan curve, the hyper-raster, and a marginal approach. While each approach has its own merits and drawbacks, there should be methods by which to convert one representation to another. This, however, is currently unattainable as the digital Jordan curve approach and the hyper-raster approach are formulated upon different domains of objects, with the more verbose digital Jordan curve approach serving as a subset of the hyper-raster approach with respect to objects which are simple regions in R2. This paper revisits the approach of the digital Jordan curve by removing the digital Jordan curve restriction, replacing it with the set of pixels that neighbor an exterior pixel, allowing for a host of different relations in pixel space. This increase in domain results in a set of 62 available 9-intersection matrices, a nearly four-fold increase from the original 16 matrices and demonstrates the novelty of this approach with respect to the egg-yolk relations, a model in R2 for relations between regions with broad boundaries.}

Typical land cover classifications for such purposes result from a top-down process and rely on expert conceptualisations, and thus provide limited space for incorporating more widely held views of key landscape elements. In this paper we introduce the notion of spatial folksonomies, which we define as a tuple linking a vocabulary of landscape terms through authors and resources to locations. We demonstrate how spatial folksonomies can automatically be created for Switzerland using two text corpora: the Swiss Alpine Club's yearbook for the past 150 years and user generated content from a website describing a wide range of outdoor activities. The spatial folksonomies capture variation in space of the use of nouns describing 96 natural landscape terms (e.g. ridge, forest, mountain, etc.) and allow us to characterise regions and compute similarities. We compare our spatial folksonomies to two traditional land cover/land use classifications (CORINE and Arealstatistik) and demonstrate that despite their very different sources, the approaches capture landscape variation in broadly similar ways. However, our spatial folksonomies provide new insights into how landscapes are described, through for example variation in space, time and through the prism of different activities. We argue that our spatial folksonomies are a novel way of capturing variation closer to the bottom-up understandings of landscape for instance required to describe cultural ecosystem services.}

Our review shows that (1) adaptive resilience is mapped after a disaster mainly through the measure of recovery and inherent resilience is mapped using top-down approaches. Regarding inherent resilience (2), very few methods have been applied at city scale; (3) the limit between resilience and vulnerability mapping is still narrow and may cause confusion for decision makers; (4) the choice of variables and indicators to measure and map resilience is often a function of data availability and reliability; (5) indicators developed in one specific context should not be applied systematically to other contexts as resilience is a context-dependent concept; (6) most resilience maps are based on an analytical approach and do not reflect the systemic property of resilience.}

abstract = {Microscopic traffic simulators have become efficient tools to conduct different analytic studies on roads, vehicles, behavior of drivers, and critical intersections, which lead towards a well-planned traffic solution. Devising a realistic and sustainable traffic solution requires replication of the real traffic scenario in a simulator. For example, to simulate the traffic stream of less developed countries, we need to simulate non-lane based heterogeneous traffic stream, i.e., motorized and non-motorized vehicles, with their on road behaviors such as irregular pedestrian, illegal parking, violation of laws pertaining lanes, etc. However, most of the existing traffic simulators are unable to mimic the unstructured road traffic stream of less developed countries with their diversified behaviors. We also need to represent the corresponding geographical maps as a list of nodes and edges with relevant geographic information such as length and width of the edges to feed the simulator. However, we lack a Geographic Information System (GIS) protocol to construct an effective simulator readable road network from authoritative polygonal GIS maps. State-of-the-art GIS protocol often converts the geographical maps using polyline data collected from less-credible OpenStreetMap. Although polyline data has length information (for example, length of a street), it lacks width information limiting its capability of being an effective simulator readable road network map. Therefore, in this work, we propose a new microscopic traffic simulator to handle unstructured road traffic stream of less developed countries with their diversified behaviors. To feed the simulator, we also propose a novel parsing algorithm to construct an effective simulator-readable road network from GIS maps through extracting both length and width information of the edges and develop parser based on the algorithm. Our parsing algorithm realizes a delicate blending of geometry with computation over road points to eventually generate the simulator-readable road network. Our simulator receives the network topology generated by our parser, traffic routes, and traffic demand flow rates as input, visualizes the traffic flows, and provides relevant traffic statistics. To evaluate sustainability of our proposed parser and simulator in real-life scenarios, we evaluate our parser by parsing GIS street maps of four different areas resulting in 86% accuracy on an average and evaluate our simulator after necessary calibration using real traffic data resulting in 99% accuracy in terms of travel time.}

Although mobile phones enable the user’s position to be located with a certain degree of accuracy from a large number of people and become one of the most promising devise, unwillingness to share related with privacy issues still remain. Therefore, it is also important to establish a practical method for reconstructing people flow from various kinds of existing fragmentary spatio-temporal data, such as public traffic survey data, from a view of complementariness with mobile phone data. In this study, we propose a combination of spatio-temporal correction processes to a previously published method, to generate continuous spatio-temporal people flow data sets at chosen intervals in selected cities. The correction methods include temporal smoothing of departure time using kernel density estimation, network data correction in OpenStreetMap data, and spatial smoothing in geocoding with MODIS data. We also compare the reconstruction accuracy by deriving correlation coefficients for different combinations of correction methods. Such reconstructed people flow data can potentially be used as infrastructure data in various fields, including emergency planning and related events in areas where data collection and real-time awareness are weak.}

Here we highlight what is understood by participation according to different actors and various international contexts. This study was motivated by a workshop where flood-risk and resilience experts from 14 countries perceived the nature of participation and the lack of its implementation differently. To unravel the multitude of these perspectives, 27 expert interviews were conducted in seven countries: Belgium, Germany, Indonesia, Iran, Nepal, Pakistan and Peru between March and August 2020. Results show that constraints on the conduction of participation are not only related to the specific country context but differ even within countries. Limitations such as capacities and willingness to participate as well as the role and importance of participation are common issues across the investigated contexts and countries.}

The study combined smartphone GPS tracking, route drawing and a questionnaire to examine differences between user groups in their use of formal trails, off-trail behaviour and the motivations that affect it. In our sample (n = 233), different activity types were associated with distinctive spatial patterns and potential extent of impacts. The density mapping and statistical analyses indicated three types of behaviour: predominantly on or close to formal trails (runners and cyclists), spatially concentrated off-trail behaviour confined to a few informal paths (mountain bikers), and dispersed off-trail use pattern (walkers and dog walkers). Across all user groups, off-trail behaviour was mainly motivated by positive attraction towards the environment such as scenic view, exploration, and viewing flora and fauna. Study findings lead to several management recommendations that were presented to city officials. These include reducing dispersion and the spatial extent of trampling impacts by encouraging use of a limited number of well-established informal paths away from sensitive vegetation and protected habitats.}

Previous food environment studies have revealed a disparity of access to healthful food on various geographical scales. An overlooked facet of this spatial perspective is the impact of the food environment at the individual level. Individuals tend to make diverse food purchasing and dining choices, including where, when, how, and which types of food to acquire. An unexplored avenue for further investigation is measuring the extent to which people's preference for food is elicited by exposure to their immediate food environment. This paper takes an innovative approach to this question by soliciting individual data about food-related activities from social media, or specifically, “tweets” (messages sent on Twitter). With spatiotemporally tagged information, tweets provide an ideal method for measuring the exposure to the food environment in real time. This measure, as a representative of individual food access, is associated with users' particular diet choices conveyed in their tweets. By comparing groups of Twitter users who shop in grocery stores to those who dine at fast food restaurants, we found that the prevalence of grocery stores that stock fresh produce within an individual's neighborhood may significantly influence him or her to make nutritious food choices. This study has a great potential to inform health professionals and stakeholders of the significance of social media in assisting with crowdsourcing human subject data that incorporate spatiotemporal dimensions and to explore individual diets in relation to their perceived food environment, which can positively impact the health of communities.}

In light of the limitations of previous flood exposure studies in the U.S, this study uses the recently released Microsoft building footprint dataset to capture the heterogeneity of population distribution at the micro-level. The population at block group level from ACS 5-year estimates (2013–2017) is further disaggregated to residential buildings, identified via NLUD 2010 and OpenStreetMap Land Use polygons. A comparative study is then conducted to investigate the 100-year flood exposure from FEMA and from the other three publicly available 100-year floodplains. Although the exposure analysis shows varying spatial patterns for selected floodplains, it indicates that a large number of exposed residents are found in regions where FEMA floodplain product is unavailable, presumably responsible for the uncaptured losses reported from other studies. In addition, the inequitably high flood risk experienced by the poor revealed at the national level underscores the significance of flood vulnerability studies to emphasize the need for this vulnerable group.}

The complexity of factors affecting preferences for visual quality raise the question of whether the objectifying of this kind of research is possible. That is why the aim of this paper is to determine if it is possible to generalise peoples' preferences on rural landscapes. This study developed the Index of Prognosis Rural Landscape Preferences (IPRLP), which is composed of nine variables referring to the presence or percentage share of different landscape attributes. The IPRLP was tested on 32 scenes of two regions located in Central Eastern Poland - the Polesie region and the Roztocze region. The index values were compared with real preferences expressed by respondents (n = 240). The results showed that this index was highly correlated with the respondents’ preferences (0.79 < r < 0.90), which indicates that objectivity of visual preferences studies are possibly based on the mathematical model. Stepwise multiple regression indicates three explanatory variables of the model: percentage of buildings (PB), presence of negative manmade objects (NE) and degree of naturalness (DN) indicating that it is easier to predict what kind of landscape people would not prefer than would prefer.}

abstract = {Reliable urban land-use maps are essential for urban analysis because the spatial distribution of land use reflects the complex environment of cities under the combined effects of nature and socio-economics. In recent years, very high resolution (VHR) remote sensing imagery interpretation has resolved the “semantic gap” between the low-level data and the high-level semantic scenes, and has been used to map urban land use. Nevertheless, the existing frameworks cannot easily be applied to practical urban analysis, which can be attributed to three main reasons: 1) the indistinguishable socio-economic attributes of the same ground object layouts; 2) the weak transferability of the supervised frameworks and the time-consuming training sample annotation; and 3) the category system inconsistency between the data source and the urban land-use application. In this paper, to achieve an “application gap” breakthrough for urban land-use mapping, a data-driven point, line, and polygon semantic object mapping (PLPSOM) framework is proposed, which makes full use of open-source VHR images and multi-source geospatial data. In the PLPSOM framework, point, line, and polygon semantic objects are represented by the points of interest (POIs), OpenStreetMap (OSM) data, and VHR images corresponding to the scenes in the land-use mapping units, respectively. OSM line semantic objects are utilized to supply the boundaries of the land-use mapping units for the POIs and VHR images, forming urban land parcels (street blocks). To reduce the cost of the data annotation, the training dataset is constructed using multiple open-source data sources. An enhanced deep adaptation network (EDAN) is then proposed to acquire the categories of the VHR scene images in the case of partial transfer learning. Finally, in order to meet the actual needs, a rule-based category mapping (RCM) model is applied to integrate the categories of the POIs and VHR images into the urban land-use category system, allowing us to acquire the land-use maps of the cities. The effectiveness of the proposed method was tested in four cities of China, including six specific areas: Beijing and Wuhan city centers; the Hanyang District of Wuhan; the Hannan District of Wuhan; Macao; and the Wan Chai area of Hong Kong, achieving a high classification accuracy. The “urban image” analysis confirmed the practicality of the obtained urban land-use maps.}

An important step in the development of renovation strategy and energy conservation advising is to gather information of the energy performance of the existing buildings. However, renovation strategies must also consider the socio-economic challenges associated with the cost of energy retrofitting. This paper describes the development of an energy atlas of the multifamily building stock in Sweden for visualizing and analyzing energy use and renovation needs. The atlas has been developed using Extract Transform and Load technology (ETL) to aggregate information on the energy performance, building ownership, renovation status, and socio-economic status of inhabitants from various data sources. The atlas can visualize the energy use and renovation status of multifamily buildings in 2D maps and 3D models, displaying data for either individual buildings or aggregated data on spatial scales ranging from 250×250m squares through district and municipality to county areas. A demonstration of its use on national and city scales indicates that energy retrofits of multifamily buildings reaching a service life of 50years can reduce the energy use of the existing building stock by up to 50% relative to 1990. However, costs associated with renovation and energy retrofits of multifamily buildings can be problematic, especially in economically weak suburbs. A good understanding of past and future renovation needs and socio-economic consequences is important in the development of a sustainable national renovation strategy.}

We based on the case study of Kuala Lumpur and found that when a rail network grows with a simple tree-like network to a more intricate form, the network diameter and the average shortest path length of multi-layer networks decrease dramatically. The network expansion ability keeps changing and more rail stations in the city centre have higher ability for future expansion. Changes in betweenness centrality and closeness centrality of multi-layer networks essentially hinge on the growth of rail network, with the highest change rate of closeness centrality at around 211.48%. The growth of network allows the remainder of the network to be easily visited, with the highest change rate of network accessibility around 12%. Different performances of these nodes added in the multi-layer network are discussed to show their impact on the repartition of network communities and the number of communities is decreasing. We believe this research can benefit scholars to easily understand and apply these network dynamic computational techniques.}

abstract = {Although the benefit of participatory sensing for collecting local data over large areas has long been recognized, it has not been widely used for various applications such as disaster preparation due to a lack of geospatial localization capability with respect to a distant object. In such applications, objects of interest need to be robustly localized and documented for supporting data-driven decision-making in site inspection and resource mobilization. However, participatory sensing is inappropriate to localize a distant object due to the absence of ranging sensors in citizens' mobile devices; thus, the localization accuracy varies to a large extent. To address this issue, this study presents a novel geospatial localization method for distant objects based on participatory sensing. The proposed geospatial localization process consists of multiple computational modules—a geographic coordinate conversion, mean-shift clustering, deep learning-based object detection, magnetic declination adjustment, line of sight equation formulation, and the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse method—to improve the localization accuracy in participatory sensing environments. The experiments were conducted in Houston and College Station in Texas to evaluate the proposed method, and the experimental results demonstrated a reasonable localization accuracy, recording the distance errors of 1.5 m to 27.8 m when the distance from observers to the objects of interest were 17 m to 296 m. The proposed method is expected to contribute to rapid data collection over large urban areas, thereby facilitating disaster preparedness that needs to identify locations of distant objects at risk.}

There is little published information on the spatial accuracy of PPGIS data compared to expert-derived GIS data. This study assesses the spatial accuracy of PPGIS data collected for conservation planning in two regions of New Zealand in 2011 by comparing participant mapped locations of native vegetation with areas identified in the New Zealand Land Cover Database (LCDB) Version 2. Spatial error was operationalized as PPGIS locations having no native vegetation within 1000m. The results indicate relatively low PPGIS spatial error of about 6% compared to 22% for randomly selected point locations in the regions. Spatial error is largest in coastal regions and near population centers where native vegetation is sparse and patchy. Participant familiarity with the study region is related to spatial error and is reflected in PPGIS sampling groups, with randomly sampled households having the largest error rate and the self-selected public, the lowest error rate. The results indicate a competitive, trade-off relationship between PPGIS participation rates and spatial accuracy. Future PPGIS research should identify processes with the capacity to increase both participation and spatial accuracy concurrently.}

However, although the current works in this area have sought to provide a more accurate and better technological infrastructure of systems to support these tasks, they have failed to examine key features that may affect the decision-making. In light of this, this paper aims to provide an understanding of the decision-making process in control rooms for disaster risk monitoring and early warning. This understanding is underpinned by a conceptual framework, which has been developed in this work and describes factors that influence the decision-making. For doing so, data were collected through a series of semi-structured interviews and participatory observations and later evaluated with members of the control room of the Brazilian Center for Monitoring and Early Warning of Natural Disasters (Cemaden). The study findings provided a solid basis for designing the conceptual framework of the essential factors required by the decision-makers. These factors are separated into two groups: 1) the “dimensions” of decision-making (i.e., the type of hazard, the phase of the disaster risk, the location, and area of expertise of the operators) and the “pillars” of decision-making (i.e., the tasks, their required information, useful data sources, and the decision rule). Finally, the contributions achieved in this study may help operators to understand and propose proactive measures that could improve their decision-making, overcome uncertainties, standardize the team's decision-making, and put less pressure on operators.}

In response to the European Commission’s Communication on Green Infrastructure from 2013, the GREEN SURGE project aimed to further advance the development of UGI in European cities by (i) strengthening the conceptual foundations of UGI, (ii) developing improved methods and tools for assessment of its state, benefits and governance and, (iii) applying these to build a stronger evidence base. This paper aims to provide an overall synthesis of the project’s main achievements. GREEN SURGE adopted an inter- and transdisciplinary approach. Urban Learning Labs and focal Learning Alliances in five cities were instrumental for intensive collaboration between disciplines and across science and practice. Pan-European surveys, e.g. of planning and governance practice or human-nature interactions established the state-of-the-art across the continent and identified good practices. The project consolidated green infrastructure planning and governance conceptually, and it mapped opportunities for better linking government-led planning with bottom-up initiatives for creating and managing UGI. It also introduced a framework for knowledge integration to support UGI valuation. Importantly, development and application of the concept of biocultural diversity gave new insights into human–nature relationships in multicultural urban societies. The results strongly call for more context-sensitive development of UGI that addresses the different needs and diverse cultural practices of people engaging with nature. In a nutshell, GREEN SURGE showed that UGI indeed can make a major contribution to sustainable and resilient urbanisation. Transdisciplinary research in urban labs, if well-conceived, has shown to hold great potential to advance UGI concepts, methods, knowledge and practice.}

During the spring months, elevation was also a top contributing variable to the model.

The place-based thoughts and feelings of an individual do not, however, always fit well with the space-based points and polygons into which they are typically reduced in such a system, which can limit the effectiveness of many traditional PPGIS' for data collection. In order to address this issue, an alternative PPGIS platform is presented, which allows the collection, storage and analysis of spatial data from the public without the requirement to artificially reduce these data to geographic primitives. The ‘Spraycan’ platform allows participants to create spatial representations on a map using a familiar airbrush-style interface, permitting the creation of vague regions and boundaries that better reflect the places to which they refer. Data are stored within a ‘multi-point-and-attribute’ data structure whereby each individual ‘dot’ of ‘paint’ created using the airbrush is stored as a discrete geographical object, and is joined to all other associated ‘dots’, as well as a variety of other demographic and contextual data, including free-text data in which the participants may add context to their spray patterns. The flexibility of this data structure provides a wide and extensible variety of analytical choices for the researcher, as is shown here by an example study demonstrating the use of the Spraycan for decision-support, as well as a number of real-world ‘in the wild’ applications. It is hoped that this work will open up the agenda for alternative PPGIS interfaces, in order to further explore the possibilities associated with the capture and analysis of ‘fuzzy’ place-based data.}

Over the past few years, two approaches to the assessment of spatial-emotional interactions have emerged: the assessment of emotion using subjective self-reported measures and the exploration of objective physiological measures of emotional arousal using ambulatory sensing techniques. To date, most empirical research exploring spatial-emotional interactions has focused on the individual level. The present study is the first to systematically map the emotional characteristics of a large-scale urban environment using aggregative measures of emotion (subjective and objective). By mapping the subjective emotional experience of 144 individuals through real-time surveys administered through Experience Sampling Methods (ESM) as well as mapping an objective physiological measurement of emotional arousal (Skin Conductance Level) of 68 tourists, we were able to create ‘emotional maps’ of the city of Jerusalem. The maps identify emotionally arousing areas of the city, point to emotional ‘clusters’ and ‘boundaries’, and identify discontinuities (and continuities) in emotional space throughout the city. The theoretical and practical implications of this new method for planning and policy are discussed.}

One of the most affected cities was Copiapó (northern Chile) located downstream of the junction between the Copiapó river and its ephemeral tributary Quebrada Paipote. This work analyses the features of this catastrophic flood and relates them with the identified impacts. A large volume of water mixed with fine sediments overflowed the tributary channel generating a flood that affected 72% of the urban area. The rheological (velocity, density and flow regime) and sedimentary features of the flow reveal the occurrence of massive mudflows that infilled the space available inside the buildings, buried the streets with a sandy mud deposit of more than 30 cm medium thickness and collapsed the sewer network. The post-event survey carried out by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Planning (MINVU) was used for the development of fragility curves that allows modelling the probability of damage. Results indicate that the greatest probability of building damage is generated by the accumulation of sediments instead of by the flow depth. On the other hand, once the very fine grain sediments of the top of the deposit dried up, it increased the concentration of post-event suspension particulate matter, causing a health issue. This work highlights the need to understand mudflow processes and their consequences in arid environments to improve urban planning and mitigate future damages since their impacts strongly affect infrastructures and communities.}

We describe two major stages to achieving this – a per-building classification model and post-classification analysis to improve the accuracy of the class inferences. In the first stage, we extract measures of the morphology and neighbourhood characteristics from readily available topographic mapping, a high-resolution Digital Surface Model and statistical boundary data. These measures are then used as features within a random forest classifier to infer an age category for each building. We evaluate various predictive model combinations based on scenarios of available data, evaluating these using 5-fold cross-validation to train and tune the classifier hyper-parameters based on a sample of city properties. A separate sample estimated the best performing cross-validated model as achieving 77% accuracy. In the second stage, we improve the inferred per-building age classification (for a spatially contiguous neighbourhood test sample) through aggregating prediction probabilities using different methods of spatial reasoning. We report on three methods for achieving this based on adjacency relations, near neighbour graph analysis and graph-cuts label optimisation. We show that post-processing can improve the accuracy by up to 8 percentage points.}

Gamified elements aim to encourage the user to experience the underlying mechanisms of the system under alternating planning scenarios. These mechanisms are modelled as a combination of spatially implicit and explicit rules which can be derived from dependencies in the data itself. Spatial attractiveness was modelled as a function of accessibility of facilities, ground value, soil sealing, traffic intensity and noise pollution in a multi-variate spatial autoregressive regression analysis. A case study for the city center of Herdecke (Germany) revealed that the establishment of a new event location in the northern part of the study area was most appropriate for increasing spatial attractiveness.

Here we propose a new framework for efficient human settlement extraction from Landsat images over large areas. First, an inventory-based training set is adopted to obtain some statistical parameters required to build a non-settlement mask. The mask can not only reduce unnecessary computation but also reduce the impact of background noise. Thereafter, for the un-masked areas we calculate the similarity of each image pixel to pre-collected sample points, and only those within certain threshold are treated as the settlement class. This approach is very fast and has been applied to three rapidly developing regions in China. Accuracy assessment indicates that the mean overall accuracies are 87%, 89% and 89% for Jing-Jin-Ji region, Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta, respectively. This work may be applied to human settlement extraction at even broader spatial scales.}

To fill this research gap, this paper introduces a novel data integration framework for developing an evacuation decision support system for wildfire, Integrated Wildfire Evacuation Decision Support System (IWEDSS). IWEDSS integrates multiple data sources including social media, census survey, geographic information systems (GIS) data layers, volunteer suggestions, and remote sensing data. The integration is based on multi-disciplinary theoretical and modeling approaches including Geographic Information Science, civil and transportation engineering, computer science, social media and communication. IWEDSS includes four core modules: dynamic population estimation, stage-based robust evacuation planning, social perception analysis, and web-based geomatical analytic platform. It offers tools for evacuation planers and resource managers to make better decisions that can reduce the evacuation time and potential number of injuries and deaths. This paper also presents a case study to demonstrate the suitability of incorporating social media data to estimate the dynamic change of human population.}

abstract = {One challenge facing spatial scientists trying to support public health outreach and intervention in challenging environments is the lack of fine scale spatial data. These data are required to gain a better understanding of both physical and social systems; why disease occurs where it does, and how to disrupt it. While data options exist, including high resolution aerial imagery, remotely sensed data, and even online mapping products like Google Street View, these all come with limitations. One option that has previously been utilized to assess cholera risk is spatial video. Here it is used to map potential mosquito breeding sites in an endemic Dengue and Chikungunya, and emerging Zika impacted community. We show how this method can provide mapping support in the hands of non-specialist public health workers who, working in collaboration with out-of-area geographic information systems (GIS) teams, can identify where to target limited intervention resources. We use a case study of an impoverished informal style Nicaraguan community suffering from a high disease burden to show spatial variation in potential mosquito breeding habitats. A field team collected street-by-street spatial video data to produce fine scale risk maps of standing water and trash locations, which, when interpreted with the associated spatial video imagery, were used to suggest where intervention strategies should be targeted. We also discuss how these same data layers can be used to address other health concerns traditionally found in informal settlements.}

In this research, we first identify a range of diverse factors that travelers take into account in their route choice decision in the network. A stated preference survey is conducted to show the heterogeneity in the preferences of users and its dependence to the purpose of the trips over the weekdays and weekends. Interestingly, results of the survey show that road safety is the most influential factor in the route choice decision of the average participants over weekends, exceeding even the travel time, and participants give more importance to the scenic quality of the routes for their weekend trips in comparison to their weekday trips. The results of the second part of the survey also indicate that in 27% of the cases participants choose routes other than the ones suggested by navigation systems, and 33% of the times that they take the suggested routes, they modify these routes according to their own preferences. The partial inability of existing navigation systems to suggest the routes that match the preferences of users can be attributed to ignoring (1) the diversity in influential factors and (2) the heterogeneity in preferences of the users by these systems. We propose a dynamic mixed logit route choice model to include the effects of information and learning to estimate parameters of a multivariable utility function for individual users based on their own historical route choice data over time. Finally, we present the concept of a smart navigation system that can gather the required information from real-time and online sources to suggest the routes that best match the users’ own preferences.}

Planning policies support the development of healthy, liveable cities. Yet, recent research suggests they may not offer enough detail to provide on-the-ground delivery of social and transport infrastructure that supports and impacts healthy, active behaviours and the subjective wellbeing of residents in new developments and growth areas.
Methods
Three analyses were conducted. First, planning policies were reviewed using a content analysis to identify environmental features known to support healthy and active behaviours. Then, for two growth area estates located in Melbourne, Australia (Allura and Selandra Rise), the on-the-ground delivery of these planning policies were evaluated using spatial data of key destinations (e.g., shops, schools, and transport) and geographic information systems analysis. Finally, the health and subjective wellbeing of adult residents from these two estates combined (n = 352) was assessed using survey methodology. This included asking residents about the importance and satisfaction with access to transport and key destinations.
Results
We found that many built environment features were mentioned in the policy documents; however policy standards for dwelling density remain low at 15 dph and distances for accessing activity centres too long at 1 km to adequately support the walkability of new growth areas. We found generally, that average distances to key destinations were longer and more variable in growth areas in comparison to inner city areas and Greater Melbourne overall. For residents, satisfaction with access to destinations differed between the two case study areas. Residents in Allura, where destination and transport access was generally poorer were less satisfied, whilst those in the more walkable and established Selandra Rise area were more satisfied.
Conclusions
Although planning policies support the development of active transport and healthy, liveable cities they are insufficient for influencing healthy behaviours when not well implemented. Early delivery of social and transport infrastructure and services must occur early in the development cycle of new growth areas to support healthier and more sustainable behaviours.}

Combined with cloud-based computing resources, and data collection through the crowd, these solutions have substantially improved possibilities for monitoring changes in land resources, especially in areas with difficult accessibility and data scarcity. In this study, we developed and tested a participatory mapping methodology utilizing the open data catalogues and cloud computing capacity to map the previously unknown extent and species composition of forest plantations in the Southern Highlands area of Tanzania, a region experiencing a rapid growth of smallholder-owned woodlots. A large set of reference data, focusing on forest plantation coverage, species and age information distribution, was collected in a two-week participatory GIS campaign where 22 Tanzanian experts interpreted very high-resolution satellite images in Google Earth with the Open Foris Collect Earth tool developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. The collected samples were used as training data to classify a multi-sensor image stack of Landsat 8 (2013–2015), Sentinel-2 (2015–2016), Sentinel-1 (2015), and SRTM derived elevation and slope data layers into a 30 m resolution forest plantation map in Google Earth Engine. The results show that the forest plantation area was estimated with high overall accuracy (85%). The interpretation accuracy of local experts was high considering general definition of forest plantation declining with increased details in interpretation attributes. The results showcase the unique value of local expert participation, enabling the collection of thousands of reference samples over a large geographical area in a short period of time simultaneously building the capacity of the experts. However, sufficient training prior to the data collection is crucial for the interpretation success especially when detailed interpretation is conducted in complex landscapes. Since the methodology is built on open-access data and software, it presents a highly feasible solution for repetitive land resource mapping applicable at different spatial scales globally.}

Despite a growing number of studies on mapping cultural ecosystem services, most are local-scale assessments that rely on costly and time-consuming primary data collection. As a result, the availability of spatial information on non-market values associated with cultural ecosystem services (social values) remains limited. Spatial function transfer, if it could be justified for social-value models, would expedite the development of social-value information and promote its more regular inclusion in ecosystem service assessments. We used survey data from six national forests in Colorado and Wyoming to explore the potential for transferring cultural ecosystem service models between forests and specifically to test the hypothesis that transfer performance increases with social-context similarity between transferring and receiving areas. Results confirm this relationship but fall just short of being able to predict with certainty when transferred models will meet the minimum performance criterion needed for defensible use by managers. Our results suggest that with the right combination of indicators spatial function transfer can become a defensible means of generating social-value information when primary data collection is not feasible.}

However, these powerful methods often fail to perform pattern analysis and knowledge mining with spatial vector data because in most cases, such data are not underlying grid-like or array structures but can only be modeled as graph structures. The present study introduces a novel graph convolution by converting it from the vertex domain into a point-wise product in the Fourier domain using the graph Fourier transform and convolution theorem. In addition, the graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) architecture is proposed to analyze graph-structured spatial vector data. The focus of this study is the classical task of building pattern classification, which remains limited by the use of design rules and manually extracted features for specific patterns. The spatial vector data representing grouped buildings are modeled as graphs, and indices for the characteristics of individual buildings are investigated to collect the input variables. The pattern features of these graphs are directly extracted by training labeled data. Experiments confirmed that the GCNN produces satisfactory results in terms of identifying regular and irregular patterns, and thus achieves a significant improvement over existing methods. In summary, the GCNN has considerable potential for the analysis of graph-structured spatial vector data as well as scope for further improvement.}

While such threats have been mapped, their uncertainties from different climate scenarios and longer planning horizons have yet to be addressed from both an exposure assessment and a stakeholder outreach perspective. Therefore, we chose the highly urbanized San Francisco Bay Area as an example to project its flood areas every 20 years between 2000 and 2100, under 24 varied climate scenarios with two greenhouse gas (GHG) concentration levels. We then assessed flood exposure by intersecting the flood areas with demographic and socioeconomic distributions, developed areas, lifeline infrastructures, and emergency responders in low elevation (<10 m) coastal zones. Our median estimates under the low GHG scenarios indicated that 10–38% of the items assessed above are flood-exposed in 2000–2020, with this exposure increasing to 20–54% during 2080–2100. The median estimates under the high GHG scenarios for the same periods are 0–35% and 40–67%, respectively. The expected uncertainties, or standard deviations, of the exposures for a given item assessed above under the low and high GHG scenarios are 1–2% in 2000–2020 and 7–10% in 2080–2100. Despite our modeling capability for a range of climate scenarios over the long term, some stakeholders, particularly those in the private sector, prefer near-term results with lower uncertainties. This implies the need for coastal urban areas to cope with climate-related uncertainties and to focus on the long term when developing strategies and policies for climate change adaptation.}

It is characterized by the so-called four Vs: volume, velocity, veracity and variety and may bring significant value through the processing of Big Data. The transformation of Big Data's 4 Vs into the 5th (value) is a grand challenge for processing capacity. Cloud Computing has emerged as a new paradigm to provide computing as a utility service for addressing different processing needs with a) on demand services, b) pooled resources, c) elasticity, d) broad band access and e) measured services. The utility of delivering computing capability fosters a potential solution for the transformation of Big Data's 4 Vs into the 5th (value). This paper investigates how Cloud Computing can be utilized to address Big Data challenges to enable such transformation. We introduce and review four geospatial scientific examples, including climate studies, geospatial knowledge mining, land cover simulation, and dust storm modelling. The method is presented in a tabular framework as a guidance to leverage Cloud Computing for Big Data solutions. It is demostrated throught the four examples that the framework method supports the life cycle of Big Data processing, including management, access, mining analytics, simulation and forecasting. This tabular framework can also be referred as a guidance to develop potential solutions for other big geospatial data challenges and initiatives, such as smart cities.}

The study builds on survey data and spatial data from three urban contexts of Beijing, Gothenburg and Malmo to analyse both individual-level and contextual factors influencing sustainable travel behaviour. The results indicate that despite varying contexts, the three dimensions of attitude, skills and access significantly explain individuals’ travel behaviour and their choice to travel by public transport, bicycle or car. Among the studied travel modes, cycling appears to be a competitive mode when the travel distances are within 5 km. In all three urban contexts, individuals who have greater environmental awareness are more likely to travel by public transport or cycling if the physical conditions facilitate using these modes. Good access to public transport is likely to increase the usage of both cycling and public transport and reduce car use. Favourable conditions for cycling within 2 km and 5 km radius can positively encourage people to use a bicycle as a feeder mode for public transport. Overall, our findings demonstrate that for mobility policies to increase individuals’ motility in relation to sustainable travel modes and encourage a travel behaviour shift towards using alternatives to cars, planners need to take more holistic approaches and design policies that deal with the three motility dimensions in an integrated manner and avoid focusing on a single dimension in isolation.}

Public participation GIS (PPGIS) survey methods were implemented in two separate study areas in Norway to identify ecosystem values and to analyze their spatial association with land cover data. The ecosystem value associations with land cover were generally consistent with global findings reported elsewhere, with forested areas providing multiple ecosystem “bundles” supporting both recreation-related and provisioning values. Alternative value transfer methods were demonstrated using recreation value to compare actual with predicted distributions using land cover indices derived from value proportions, deviations from expected distribution, and correlation coefficients with ecosystem value bundles. The use of simple ecosystem value percentages located within land cover classes provided the best predictive results for value transfer in this study. The limitations and potential for value transfer methods based on spatial associations between mapped ecosystem values and physical landscape characteristics are discussed.}

It is now clear that positional errors can result in flawed findings and poor public health decisions. Yet the current state-of-practice is to ignore geocoding positional uncertainty, primarily because of a lack of theory, methods and tools for quantifying, modeling, and adjusting for geocoding positional errors in health analysis. This paper proposes a research agenda to address this need. It summarizes the basics of the geocoding process, its assumptions, and empirical evidence describing the magnitude of geocoding positional error. An overview of the impacts of positional error in health analysis, including accessibility, disease clustering, exposure reconstruction, and spatial weights estimation is presented. The proposed research agenda addresses five key needs: (1) a lack of standardized, open-access geocoding resources for use in health research; (2) a lack of geocoding validation datasets that will allow the evaluation of alternative geocoding engines and procedures; (3) a lack of spatially explicit geocoding positional error models; (4) a lack of resources for assessing the sensitivity of spatial analysis results to geocoding positional error; (5) a lack of demonstration studies that illustrate the sensitivity of health policy decisions to geocoding positional error.}

Out of the three components of risk—hazard, exposure, and vulnerability—exposure is the least studied, and is commonly treated as being constant in time. This approach neglects the dynamics associated with rapid development and urbanization, misrepresenting exposure in risk assessments. In this paper, mixed research methods are used to understand the dynamics of exposure in Santiago, the capital of Chile, between 1992 and 2017. First, residential exposure is modelled for three epochs using census data and public databases. Then, semi-structured interviews are conducted with local experts in engineering, planning, and disaster risk reduction to unveil the role of earthquake risk information in urban policy and development. Results show a steady expansion and densification of the city over the last 25 years, which is expected to continue in the future. The preferred building material for this growth is reinforced concrete, which rises from 3 to 17% as a proportion of the total structures in the city. It is also found that urban planning policy is disconnected from earthquake risk, which is perceived as a non-issue due to high local compliance with seismic codes. Thus, the continuous growth and homogenization of the built environment creates a singular dependence and blind trust in the local seismic academic and professional communities to provide earthquake resilience through safe buildings. These conditions configure a fragile but highly enabling environment for increasing seismic resilience in the city.}

We present findings from the pilot phase of an on-going case study in Keskuspuisto (Central park), Helsinki, Finland. The study employs an inventive and inexpensive approach for participatory data collection i.e. gathering GPS data from recreational users who have already recorded their routes for purposes other than research, using any kind of sports tracking application on their personal mobile phones. We used the SGT data to examine visitor spatial patterns on formal trails and informal paths, and present examples with runners and mountain bikers. Hotspot mapping of mountain bikers’ off-trail movement was conducted identifying several locations with clustering of off-trail use. Small-scale field mapping of three hotspot areas confirmed that the method accurately located areas of high use intensity where visible effects of path widening and high level of wear on the forest floor vegetation could be observed. We conclude that the SGT methodology offers great opportunities for gathering useful and up-to-date spatial information for adaptive planning and management as it highlights areas where conservation and visitor management measures may need to be adjusted. We suggest that this method warrants testing also for other user-centred research and planning purposes.}

We now depend on it for navigating vehicles, for route finding and we use it in our everyday lives to extract information about our locations and to track our movements. The latter use offers a potential alternative to more traditional sources of movement data through the construction of trip trajectories and, ultimately, the construction of origin-destination flow matrices. The advantage of being able to use GPS-derived movement data is that such data are potentially much richer than traditional sources of movement data both temporally and spatially. GPS-derived movement data potentially allow the calibration of spatial interaction models specific to very short time intervals, such as daily or even hourly, and for user-specified origins and destinations. Ultimately, it should be possible to calibrate continuously updated models in near real-time. However, the processing of GPS data into trajectories and then origin-destination flow matrices is not straightforward and is not well understood. This paper describes the process of transferring GPS tracking data into matrices that can be used to calibrate spatial interaction models. An example is given using retail behaviour in two towns in Scotland with an origin-constrained spatial interaction model calibrated for each day of the week and under different weather conditions (normal, rainy, windy). Although the study is small in terms of individuals and spatial context, it serves to demonstrate a future for spatial interaction modelling free from the tyranny of temporally static and spatially predefined data sets.}

abstract = {Global distribution of urban lands is one of the essential pieces of information necessary for urban planning. However, large disagreement exists among different products and the uncertainty remains difficult to quantify. We applied a Bayesian approach to map the uncertainties of global urban lands. We demonstrated the approach by producing a hybrid global urban land map that synthesized five different urban land maps in ca. 2000 at 1-km resolution. The resulting hybrid map is a posterior probability map with pixel values suggesting the probability of being urban land, which is validated by 30-m higher resolution references. We also quantified the minimum and maximum urban areas in 2000 for each country/continent based on subjective probability thresholds (i.e., 0.9 and 0.1) on our hybrid urban map. Globally, we estimated that the urban land area was between 377,000 and 533,000 km2 in 2000. The credible interval of minimum/maximum urban area can help guide future studies in estimating urban areas. In addition to providing uncertainty information, the hybrid map also achieves higher accuracy than individual maps when it is converted into a binary urban/non-urban map using a probability threshold of 0.5. This new method has the ability to further integrate discrete site/location-based data, local, regional, and global urban land maps. As more data is sequentially integrated, the accuracy is expected to improve. Therefore, our hybrid map should not be regarded as a final product, but a new prior product for future synthesis and integration toward a “big data” solution.}

abstract = {Cybercartography offers rich potential for the mapping of traditional knowledge (TK). At the same time, the particular characteristics of TK pose significant challenges for cybercartographers. TK is more than a collection of informational ‘artifacts’ that can be placed on a map; it forms part of a knowledge system that is often fundamentally different from dominant Western systems. These differences require new paradigms for thinking about maps and their objectives generally, and for thinking more specifically about how information is represented and disseminated through Cybercartography. In this chapter, the authors examine the nature of TK and the potential of Cybercartography for its representation. The authors consider the role of law (defined as explicit and enforceable rules) and normativity (defined as ‘ought’ statements that guide social relations) in shaping relationships between cartographers and the contributors of TK. They consider how those involved in such projects can use both technological and legal tools to define the terms of their collaboration and to articulate their expectations in sharing their information with a global community.}

abstract = {Literature on urban ecosystem services (UESS) is vast, particularly on cultural ecosystem services. However, due to a lack of knowledge on individual urban green spaces on the site level, further research on enhanced methods is needed to underpin existing assumptions about the reasons why people are visiting urban green spaces and what kinds of ecosystem services they can expect, with a focus on recreational activities. We argue for enhanced methods to assess supply of and demand on cultural UESS that should include the direct work with urban green space users. With the overall aim of developing a Spatial Decision Support System for visiting urban green spaces, we are applying a set of different quantitative methods to gather information on peoples’ needs and perceptions as well as data on what existing green spaces offer them. We present a two-step approach 1) linking green space criteria with recreational activities (demand-side) based on a linear series of three online surveys and 2) conducting a spatial mapping of urban green space criteria based on activity-driven indicators (supply-side). In the course of exemplified indicators operationalized by using open and local authorities′ geospatial data in an explorative study in Dresden and Heidelberg (Germany), we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the approach.}

abstract = {Understanding the complex impact of air pollution is crucial to assessing exposure risk and defining public health policies in China. However, the evidence and hence knowledge of how urban activity responds to air pollution are limited. In this paper, we propose to use geotagged check-in records on Weibo, a Tweeter-like platform, to systematically investigate the effect of air pollution on urban activity. Based on panel models, we found clear evidence that such effect exists and varies between pollutants, visitors and residents, and different activity types. Typically, SO2 has the largest impact, followed by PM2.5, NO2, and PM10; local citizens' activities are more susceptible than visitors; leisure-related activity has a sensitivity at least twofold higher than work-related activities. Additionally, we tested hypotheses about the heterogeneous effect. We confirmed the role of Income and air quality, showing that people who live in richer and more polluted cities are more likely to experience the effects of air pollution. Specifically, people who live in a more polluted city with 100 unit increments in AvgAQI show on average the same sensitivity as those who live in a less polluted city and earn about 20.3 thousand yuan more in average Income. This reveals new insights about environmental injustice in China. By presenting a portrait of the spatial heterogeneity, we argued that environmental injustice in terms of air pollution is not just about the difference in exposure risk measured based on population distribution, rather the measurement should also consider the disparity derived from urban activity. Secondly, new injustice may arise in underdeveloped areas where manufacture industry is transferred to but people barely take avoidance behavior. Finally, the map also reveals the general neglect of the detrimental effect of light air pollution, which we speculate is partly due to China's comparatively low standard in governmental regulations. We believe our finding contributes significantly to exposure risk assessment and environmental justice debates. Hence it highlights the necessity and urgency of public healthy polices that spread the health consequence of air pollution, especially in the underdeveloped region.}
