Abstract = {{Driven by the recent trends in the GIS domain including Volunteered
   Geographic Information, geo-crowdsourcing and citizen science, and
   fostered by the constant technological advances, collection and
   dissemination of geospatial information by ordinary people has become
   commonplace. However, applications involving user-generated geospatial
   content show dramatically diversified patterns in terms of incentive,
   type and level of participation, purpose of the activity, data/metadata
   provided and data quality. This study contributes to this heterogeneous
   context by investigating public participation in GIS within the field of
   mobile-based applications. Results not only show examples of how to
   technically build GIS applications enabling user collection and
   interaction with geospatial data, but they also draw conclusions about
   the methods and needs of public participation. We describe three
   projects with different scales and purposes in the context of urban
   monitoring and planning, and tourism valorisation. In each case, an open
   source architecture is used, allowing users to exploit their mobile
   devices to collect georeferenced information. This data is then made
   publicly available on specific Web viewers. Analysis of user involvement
   in these projects provides insights related to participation patterns
   which suggests some generalized conclusions. (C) 2015 International

Abstract = {{Using volunteered geographic information (VGI) as a cost-saving
   environmental monitoring and public participation mechanism has been
   thought to be a proof of concept to assist environmental decision-making
   with insufficient managerial resources. However, research literature
   also often found institutional resistance when implementing VGI as part
   of the decision-making process. This research develops a conceptual
   framework as the foundation to conduct a cross-case comparison for four
   empirical cases in recreation and invasive species monitoring, but
   general enough for other such case comparisons. The VGI Reporting
   Assessment Framework (VGI-RAF) adopted aspects of the Decision Situation
   Assessment (DSA) framework as the foundation to address institutional
   flexibility, stakeholder dynamics, and technical considerations. Using a
   cross-case comparison can accumulate deep observations from cases and
   increase validity of insights through comparing processes. Results show
   that eight aspects of the VGI-RAF reveal the suitability of embedding
   voluntary information within existing institutional decision-making
   processes. VGI-RAF depicts considerations for: (1) existing
   participation arrangements, (2) institutional arrangements, (3)
   managers' needs and stakeholder expectation, and (4) interaction
   mechanism and technical needs. The cross-comparison results indicate
   that a public participation mechanism should be accompanied by VGI
   development to increase effectiveness. Institutional arrangements should
   match local government's information needs with participants'
   expectations. Knowledge gaps between institutional information needs and
   volunteer knowledge should be filled through technology enhancements.
   For ease of implementation and to promote long-term success, we
   recommend that volunteered information be connected with existing
   communication channels to minimize changes to existing information
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{Volunteered geographic information (VGI) is the assembly of spatial
   information based on public input. While VGI has proliferated in recent
   years, assessing the quality of volunteer-contributed data has proven
   challenging, leading some to question the efficiency of such programs.
   In this paper, we compare several quality metrics for individual
   volunteers' contributions. The data were the product of the Cropland
   Capture' game, in which several thousand volunteers assessed 165,000
   images for the presence of cropland over the course of 6 months. We
   compared agreement between volunteer ratings and an image's majority
   classification with volunteer self-agreement on repeated images and
   expert evaluations. We also examined the impact of experience and
   learning on performance. Volunteer self-agreement was nearly always
   higher than agreement with majority classifications, and much greater
   than agreement with expert validations although these metrics were all
   positively correlated. Volunteer quality showed a broad trend toward
   improvement with experience, but the highest accuracies were achieved by
   a handful of moderately active contributors, not the most active
   volunteers. Our results emphasize the importance of a universal set of
   expert-validated tasks as a gold standard for evaluating VGI quality.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the usability of Future Internet technologies
   (aka ``Generic Enablers of the Future Internet{''}) in the context of
   environmental applications. The paper incorporates the best aspects of
   the state-of-the-art in environmental informatics with geospatial
   solutions and scalable processing capabilities of Internet-based tools.
   It specifically targets the promotion of the ``Environmental Observation
   Web{''} as an observation-centric paradigm for building the next
   generation of environmental applications. In the Environmental
   Observation Web, the great majority of data are considered as
   observations. These can be generated from sensors (hardware), numerical
   simulations (models), as well as by humans (human sensors).
   Independently from the observation provenance and application scope,
   data can be represented and processed in a standardised way in order to
   understand environmental processes and their interdependencies. The
   development of cross-domain applications is then leveraged by
   technologies such as Cloud Computing, Internet of Things, Big Data
   Processing and Analytics. For example, ``the cloud{''} can satisfy the
   peak-performance needs of applications which may occasionally use large
   amounts of processing power at a fraction of the price of a dedicated
   server farm. The paper also addresses the need for Specific Enablers
   that connect mainstream Future Internet capabilities with sensor and
   geospatial technologies. Main categories of such Specific Enablers are
   described with an overall architectural approach for developing

Abstract = {{With the evolution of geographic information capture and the emergency
   of volunteered geographic information, it is getting more important to
   extract spatial knowledge automatically from large spatial datasets.
   Spatial co-location patterns represent the subsets of spatial features
   whose objects are often located in close geographic proximity. Such
   pattern is one of the most important concepts for geographic context
   awareness of location-based services (LBS). In the literature, most
   existing methods of co-location mining are used for events taking place
   in a homogeneous and isotropic space with distance expressed as
   Euclidean, while the physical movement in LBS is usually constrained by
   a road network. As a result, the interestingness value of co-location
   patterns involving network-constrained events cannot be accurately
   computed. In this paper, we propose a different method for co-location
   mining with network configurations of the geographical space considered.
   First, we define the network model with linear referencing and refine
   the neighborhood of traditional methods using network distances rather
   than Euclidean ones. Then, considering that the co-location mining in
   networks suffers from expensive spatial-join operation, we propose an
   efficient way to find all neighboring object pairs for generating clique
   instances. By comparison with the previous approaches based on Euclidean
   distance, this approach can be applied to accurately calculate the
   probability of occurrence of a spatial co-location on a network. Our
   experimental results from real and synthetic data sets show that the
   proposed approach is efficient and effective in identifying co-location
   patterns which actually rely on a network. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Estimating city evacuation time is a nontrivial problem due to the
   interaction between thousands of individual agents, giving rise to
   various collective phenomena, such as bottleneck formation, intermittent
   flow, and stop-and-go waves. We present a mean field approach to draw
   relationships between road network spatial attributes, the number of
   evacuees, and the resultant evacuation time estimate (ETE). Using
   volunteered geographic information, we divide 50 United Kingdom cities
   into a total of 704 catchment areas (CAs) which we define as an area
   where all agents share the same nearest exit node. 90\% of the agents
   are within approximate to 6,847 m of CA exit nodes with approximate to
   13,778 agents/CA. We establish a characteristic flow rate from catchment
   area attributes (population, distance to exit node, and exit node width)
   and a mean flow rate in a free-flow regime by simulating total
   evacuations using an agent based ``queuing network{''} model. We use
   these variables to determine a relationship between catchment area
   attributes and resultant ETEs. This relationship could enable emergency
   planners to make a rapid appraisal of evacuation strategies and help
   support decisions in the run up to a crisis.}},

Abstract = {{Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) has been widely adopted to

   aimed to develop an effective method to assess the credibility of VGI
   for time-critical conditions, such as disaster response. We collected
   datasets from two extreme flood events in 2011 and 2013 from Brisbane,
   Australia. According to the defined geo-location factors, we built a
   binary logistic regression with the 2011 event dataset to measure the
   credibility scores of the VGI instances. At the threshold of 0.917, the
   overall accuracy of the model in the 2011 training dataset was 90.5\%.
   Next, the performance of this probability model was evaluated by the
   2013 testing instances. We found that our model could categorize the
   credibility classes with 80.4\% accuracy. These results suggest great
   potential for our model to be used by emergency management sectors to
   sort credibility of VGI for efficient and rapid response,

   about the quality of amateur mapping and data efforts are raised in the

   new technology have come out in several recent publications by
   humanitarian actors. Most of these concerns assume that volunteers have
   no professional training related to their work as volunteers. By
   investigating both the volunteers and their organizations, this article
   presents evidence of a more professional cadre of volunteers and a means

Abstract = {{Over the past several years, volunteered geographic information (VGI)

Abstract = {{We explored the potential for rapid land use/land cover (WLC) mapping
   using time-series Landsat satellite imagery and training data (for
   supervised classification) automatically extracted from crowd sourced
   OpenStreetMap (OSM) ``landuse{''} (OSM-LU) and ``natural{''} (OSM-N)
   polygon datasets. The main challenge with using these data for LULC
   classification was their high level of noise, as the Landsat images all
   contained varying degrees of cloud cover (causes of attribute noise) and
   the OSM polygons contained locational errors and class labeling errors
   (causes of class noise). A second challenge arose from the imbalanced
   class distribution in the extracted training data, which occurred due to
   wide discrepancies in the area coverage of each OSM-LU/OSM-N class. To
   address the first challenge, three relatively noise tolerant algorithms
   - naive bayes (NB), decision tree (C4.5 algorithm), and random forest
   (RF) were evaluated for image classification. To address the second
   challenge, artificial training samples were generated for the minority
   classes using the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE).
   Image classification accuracies were calculated for a four-class,
   five-class, and six-class LULC system to assess the capability of the
   proposed methods for mapping relatively broad as well as more detailed
   LULC types, and the highest overall accuracies achieved were 84.0\%
   (four-class SMOTE-RF result), 81.0\% (five-class SMOTE-RF result), and
   72.0\% (six-class SMOTE-NB result). RF and NB had relatively similar
   overall accuracies, while those of C4.5 were much lower. SMOTE led to
   higher classification accuracies for RF and C4.5, and in some cases for
   NB, despite the noise in the training set. The main advantages of the
   proposed methods are their cost- and time-efficiency, as training data
   for supervised classification is automatically extracted from the
   crowdsourced datasets and no pre-processing for cloud detection/cloud
   removal is performed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{As transport systems are pushed to the limits in many cities,
   governments have tried to resolve problems of traffic and congestion by
   increasing capacity. Miller (2013) contends the need to identify new
   capabilities (instead of capacity) of the transport infrastructure in
   order to increase efficiency without extending the physical
   infrastructure. Kenyon and Lyons (2003) identified integrated traveller
   information as a facilitator for better transport decisions. Today, with
   further developments in the use of geographic information systems (GIS)
   and a greater disposition by the public to provide volunteered
   geographic information (VGI), the potential of information is not only
   integrated across modes but also user-generated, real-time and available

   important role in sectors such as politics, businesses and

Abstract = {{As more and more governments share open data, tech developers respond by

   Building on the Johnson and Robinson ( 2014) framework for understanding

   hackathon experience were interviewed about their motivations for and
   benefits derived from participation in these events. Two broad themes
   emerged from these interviews. First, through the development of

   hackathons help put open data into public use. Second, civic hackathons
   provide government staff with valuable feedback about municipal open

Abstract = {{This article describes a Los Angeles-based website that collects
   volunteered geographic information (VGI) on outdoor advertising using
   the Google Street View interface. The Billboard Map website was designed
   to help the city regulate signage. The Los Angeles landscape is thick
   with advertising, and the city efforts to count total of signs has been
   stymied by litigation and political pressure. Because outdoor
   advertising is designed to be seen, the community collectively knows how
   many and where signs exist. As such, outdoor advertising is a perfect
   subject for VGI. This paper analyzes the Los Angeles community's entries
   in the Billboard Map website both quantitatively and qualitatively. I
   find that members of the public are well able to map outdoor
   advertisements, successfully employing the Google Street View interface
   to pinpoint sign locations. However, the community proved unaware of the
   regulatory distinctions between types of signs, mapping many more signs
   than those the city technically designates as billboards. Though these
   findings might suggest spatial data quality issues in the use of VGI for
   municipal record-keeping, I argue that the Billboard Map teaches an
   important lesson about how the public's conceptualization of the urban
   landscape differs from that envisioned by city planners. In particular,
   I argue that community members see the landscape of advertising
   holistically, while city agents treat the landscape as a collection of
   individual categories. This is important because, while Los Angeles
   recently banned new off-site signs, it continues to approve similar
   signs under new planning categories, with more in the works.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we outline the methodological development of current
   research into urban community formations based on combinations of
   qualitative (volunteered) and quantitative (spatial analytical and
   geo-statistical) data. We outline a research design that addresses
   problems of data quality relating to credibility in volunteered
   geographic information (VGI) intended for Web-enabled participatory
   planning. Here we have drawn on a dual notion of credibility in VGI
   data, and propose a methodological workflow to address its criteria. We
   propose a `super-positional' model of urban community formations, and
   report on the combination of quantitative and participatory methods
   employed to underpin its integration. The objective of this
   methodological phase of study is to enhance confidence in the quality of
   data for Web-enabled participatory planning. Our participatory method
   has been supported by rigorous quantification of area characteristics,
   including participant communities' demographic and socio-economic
   contexts. This participatory method provided participants with a ready
   and accessible format for observing and mark-making, which allowed the
   investigators to iterate rapidly a system design based on participants'
   responses to the workshop tasks. Participatory workshops have involved
   secondary school-age children in socio-economically contrasting areas of
   Liverpool (Merseyside, UK), which offers a test-bed for comparing
   communities' formations in comparative contexts, while bringing an
   under-represented section of the population into a planning domain,
   whose experience may stem from public and nonmotorised transport
   modalities. Data has been gathered through one-day participatory
   workshops, featuring questionnaire surveys, local site analysis,
   perception mapping and brief, textual descriptions. This innovative
   approach will support Web-based participation among stakeholding
   planners, who may benefit from well-structured, community-volunteered,

Volume = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Traditional urban planning processes typically happen in offices and
   behind desks. Modern types of civic participation can enhance those
   processes by acquiring citizens' ideas and feedback in participatory
   sensing approaches like ``People as Sensors{''}. As such,
   citizen-centric planning can be achieved by analysing Volunteered
   Geographic Information (VGI) data such as Twitter tweets and posts from
   other social media channels. These user-generated data comprise several
   information dimensions, such as spatial and temporal information, and
   textual content. However, in previous research, these dimensions were
   generally examined separately in single-disciplinary approaches, which
   does not allow for holistic conclusions in urban planning. This paper
   introduces TwEmLab, an interdisciplinary approach towards extracting
   citizens' emotions in different locations within a city. More
   concretely, we analyse tweets in three dimensions (space, time, and
   linguistics), based on similarities between each pair of tweets as
   defined by a specific set of functional relationships in each dimension.
   We use a graph-based semi-supervised learning algorithm to classify the
   data into discrete emotions (happiness, sadness, fear, anger/disgust,
   none). Our proposed solution allows tweets to be classified into emotion
   classes in a multi-parametric approach. Additionally, we created a
   manually annotated gold standard that can be used to evaluate TwEmLab's
   performance. Our experimental results show that we are able to identify
   tweets carrying emotions and that our approach bears extensive potential
   to reveal new insights into citizens' perceptions of the city.}},

Abstract = {{Drawing on John Agnew's (1987) theoretical framework for the analysis of

   (1991) interpretation of Kilburn High Road (London), the contribution
   develops an analysis of the notion of place in the case study of Kilburn

   interpretation of Kilburn High Road in the late Nineties with those from
   a selection of noisy and unstructured volunteered geographic information
   collected from Flickr photos and Tweets harvested in 2014-2015. The
   comparison shows how sense of place is dynamic and changing over time
   and explores Kilburn High Road through the categories of location,
   locale and sense of place derived from the qualitative analysis of VGI
   content and annotations. The contribution shows how VGI can contribute
   to discovering the unique relationship between people and place which
   takes the form given by Doreen Massey to Kilburn High Road and then
   moves on to the many forms given by people experiencing Kilburn High
   Road through a photo, a Tweet or a simple narrative. Finally, the paper

Pages = {{141-154}},
Abstract = {{Volunteered geographic information (VGI), delivered via mobile and web
   apps, offers new potentials for civic engagement. If framed in the
   context of open, transparent and accountable governance then presumably
   VGI should advance dialogue and consultation between citizen and
   government. If governments perceive citizens as consumers of services
   then arguably such democratic intent elide when municipalities use VGI.
   Our empirical research shows how assumptions embedded in VGI drive the
   interaction between citizens and government. We created a typology that
   operationalises VGI as a potential act of citizenship and an instance of
   consumption. We then selected civic apps from Canadian cities that
   appeared to invoke these VGI types. We conducted interviews with
   developers of the apps; they were from government, private sector, and
   civil society. Results from qualitative semi-structured interviews
   indicate a blurring of consumer and citizen-centric orientations among
   respondents, which depended on motivations for data use, engagement and
   communication objectives, and sector of the respondent. Citizen
   engagement, an analogue for citizenship, was interpreted multiple ways.
   Overall, we found that government and developers may increase choice by
   creating consumer-friendly apps but this does not ensure VGI offers an
   act of civic participation. The burden is placed on the contributor to
   make it so. Apps and VGI could potentially further a data-driven and
   neoliberal government. Planners should be mindful of the dominance of a
   consumer-centric view even as they assume VGI invariably improves
   democratic participation.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile sensing of Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) is expanding

   Secure probes exchange data in encrypted form with help from a

Abstract = {{The goal of this study was a better understanding of the quality of
   Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI), and by extension its utility.
   The research focused on the applicability of OpenStreetMap (OSM)
   building data for official spatial databases. In terms of feature
   completeness, the achieved results are in-line with other similar
   studies. The study concluded that in town centres the completeness of
   OSM data is relatively high but decreases further away from urban
   centres. It demonstrated that attribute completeness also relies on the
   level of urbanization as well as the nature of attribute. Furthermore, a
   very high overall positional accuracy was determined for OSM building
   data that ranged between 0.6 m in urban areas and 1.7 m in rural areas.
   This result is more than five times better than the frequently cited OSM
   accuracy results obtained by Haklay in 2010. In this work, a novel tool
   is introduced to help assess the completeness of OSM building-tagged
   features. The proposed index, called the matching feature area-based
   completeness, estimates the completeness of any areal feature set. This
   index is also flexible because it is neither affected by discrepancies
   in the feature outline modelling nor by the degree of abstraction. In
   addition, the author proposed a simple method to update the official
   register using the large volume of OSM building data
   ``over-completeness{''} together with the building data excess

Title = {{VGI for Land Administration: A Quality Perspective}},
Booktitle = {{UNCERTAINTY MODELLING AND QUALITY CONTROL FOR SPATIAL DATA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Pages = {{147-161}},
Abstract = {{The use of volunteered geographic information (VGI) or crowdsourced data
   (Goodchild, 2007) has become a common approach for data collection in
   recent years. This has caused several people to propose the use of VGI
   to collect data for various fields. Success stories were the
   (nongeographic) Wikipedia encyclopedia and OpenStreetMap (OSM). The use
   of VGI in land administration has also been proposed. Robin McLaren
   (2011) proposed crowdsourcing as a way to increase citizen collaboration
   for land administration to enhance transparency at lower costs. Keenja
   et al. (2012) discussed the perception of VGI within the Dutch cadaster.
   Basiouka and Potsiou (2012) even discuss how crowdsourcing can be used
   to identify errors in the Hellenic cadaster. One problem of VGI is
   quality control (compare Goodchild and Li, 2012). Only a small group of
   people can verify the correctness of specific types of information in a
   land administration system. A cadastral boundary line, for example,
   marks the border between two pieces of land (parcels). The correct
   location of the boundary can only be assessed by the owners of these
   parcels or by a surveyor after investigation and measurement. How can
   VGI provide reliable data if the correctness cannot be checked easily?
   Only boundaries between areas of different land use may be visible and
   thus verifiable, but land administration is equally dependent on
   ownership boundaries. In this chapter, we discuss the types of data used
   in land administration as defined by Dale and McLaughlin ( 1999). These
   categories are then analyzed to identify the areas where VGI can
   actually provide reliable input. Such an analysis shows how to use the
   methodology of crowdsourcing for land administration and clarifies the
   limits of such use.}},

Pages = {{64-77}},
Abstract = {{In this work, we present a routing approach avoiding relatively
   dangerous areas within a city. The information of how dangerous some
   urban areas are is derived using volunteered geographic information
   (VGI), governmental open data for detecting properties and
   functionalities of the urban infrastructure and historical crime data
   from police departments for detecting crime hot spots. Therefore, we
   present the basics of crime mapping and analysis with GIS, the practical
   use of VGI for routing and describe our contribution within the field of
   routing solutions. Afterwards, we explore our test data in detail. For
   the practical use, we simplify all the urban infrastructure information
   and propose a safety index, which represents the relative safety in the
   investigation area. Additionally, historical crime hot spots are
   detected and used as routing obstacles. The arcs in the road network are
   weighted by our safety index and the historical crime hot spots are
   introduced as obstacle polygons. We test our safety-aware routing design
   on Los Angeles (LA) and assume its use during night times. In this
   regard, from two relatively far away situated origin and destination
   points, we calculate the least dangerous path and compare it with the
   calculated shortest path. Vehicle drivers without knowledge about the
   dangerous areas in the city may use the least dangerous path, which is
   based on our calculated safety index. Finally, we discuss the
   effectiveness of our method and consider further extensions using freely
   available geodata.}},

Abstract = {{The emerging ubiquity of geospatial information is providing an
   unprecedented opportunity to apply Geographical Information Systems
   (GIS)-based multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to a broad
   spectrum of use cases. Volunteered geographic information, open GIS
   software, geoservice-based tools, cloud-based virtualized platforms, and
   worldwide collaboration of both domain experts and general users have
   greatly increased the quantity and accessibility of geospatially

   tools that integrate this decision-driven process within a widely
   accessible, robust geoframework environment, designed for user-friendly

   Analysis and Reasoning (GEAR), which provides a viable transition path
   to enhance geospatial MCDA in the age of open GIS. We propose a
   Web-based platform that leverages open-source geotechnologies to
   incorporate a wide variety of geospatial data formats in a common
   solution space to allow for spatially enhanced and time-relevant
   decision analysis. Through the proposed workflow, a user can ingest and
   modify heterogeneous data formats, exploit temporally tagged data
   sources, create multicriteria decision analysis models, and visualize
   the results in an iterative and collaborative workspace. A sample case
   study applied to disaster relief is used to demonstrate the prototype

Abstract = {{Current implementations of gazetteers, geographic directories that
   associate place names to geographic coordinates, cannot use semantics to
   answer complex queries (most gazetteers are just thesauri of place
   names), use domain ontologies for place name disambiguation, make their
   data sets available in the Semantic Web or support the use of
   Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI). A new generation of gazetteers
   has to tackle these problems. In this paper, we present a new
   architecture for gazetteers that uses VGI and Semantic Web tools, such
   as ontologies and Linked Open Data to overcome these limitations. We
   also present a gazetteer, the Semantic Web Interactive Gazetteer (SWI),
   implemented using this architecture, and show that it can be used to add
   absent geographic coordinates to biodiversity records. In our tests, we
   use this gazetteer to correct geographic data from a big sample (around
   142,000 occurrence records of Amazonian specimens) from SpeciesLink, a
   big repository of biodiversity collection records from Brazil. The tests
   showed that the SWI Gazetteer was able to add geographic coordinates to
   around 30,000 records, increasing the records with coordinates from
   30.29\% to 57.5\% of the total number of records in the sample
   (representing an increase of 90\%). (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The endemic Azores Bullfinch or Priolo (Pyrrhula murina) is one of the
   most threatened European passerines, historically restricted to a single
   population in the Pico da Vara/Ribeira do Guilherme Special Protection
   Area (Sao Miguel Island, Azores, Portugal). Annual census of this
   species started in 1991. It usually took one observer 1-2 months to
   complete the census and even then, it was not logistically reasonable to
   include some areas with very steep slope in the core of the protected
   area. In order to bypass these constraints, an alternative and ambitious
   monitoring scheme that would allow estimating the whole species
   throughout its entire range was proposed in 2007. The new scheme, which
   complemented and improved previous estimates, consisted in performing a
   thorough instantaneous census using a distance sampling approach, thus
   allowing a detailed snapshot of effective occupation, density, habitat
   preferences and distribution range of the Azores Bullfinch. The Priolo
   Atlas turned into a volunteered geographic information and citizen
   science-based ornithological initiative which every 4 years congregates
   more than 50 well-trained volunteers in the Azores. With the first two
   editions (2008 and 2012), this initiative has already established itself
   as a critical tool to monitor the population of this endemic species.

Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{Within ecological research and environmental management, there is
   currently a focus on demonstrating the links between human well-being
   and wildlife conservation. Within this framework, there is a clear
   interest in better understanding how and why people value certain places
   over others. We introduce a new method that measures cultural
   preferences by exploring the potential of multiple online georeferenced
   digital photograph collections. Using ecological and social
   considerations, our study contributes to the detection of places that
   provide cultural ecosystem services. The degree of appreciation of a
   specific place is derived from the number of people taking and sharing
   pictures of it. The sequence of decisions and actions taken to share a
   digital picture of a given place includes the effort to travel to the
   place, the willingness to take a picture, the decision to geolocate the
   picture, and the action of sharing it through the Internet. Hence, the
   social activity of sharing pictures leaves digital proxies of spatial
   preferences, with people sharing specific photos considering the
   depicted place not only ``worth visiting{''} but also ``worth sharing
   visually.{''} Using South Wales as a case study, we demonstrate how the
   proposed methodology can help identify key geographic features of high
   cultural value. These results highlight how the inclusion of
   geographical user-generated content, also known as volunteered
   geographic information, can be very effective in addressing some of the
   current priorities in conservation. Indeed, the detection of the most
   appreciated nonurban areas could be used for better prioritization,
   planning, and management.}},

Abstract = {{With the prevalence of smartphones, new ways of engaging citizens and
   stakeholders in urban planning and governance are emerging. The
   technologies in smartphones allow citizens to act as sensors of their
   environment, producing and sharing rich spatial data useful for new
   types of collaborative governance set-ups. Data derived from Volunteered
   Geographic Information (VGI) can support accessible, transparent,
   democratic, inclusive, and locally-based governance situations of
   interest to planners, citizens, politicians, and scientists. However,
   there are still uncertainties about how to actually conduct this in
   practice. This study explores how social media VGI can be used to
   document spatial tendencies regarding citizens' uses and perceptions of
   urban nature with relevance for urban green space governance. Via the
   hashtag \#sharingcph, created by the City of Copenhagen in 2014, VGI
   data consisting of geo-referenced images were collected from Instagram,
   categorised according to their content and analysed according to their
   spatial distribution patterns. The results show specific spatial

   much potential of using VGI for generating, sharing, visualising and
   communicating knowledge about citizens' spatial uses and preferences
   exist, but as a tool to support scientific and democratic interaction,
   VGI data is challenged by practical, technical and ethical concerns.
   More research is needed in order to better understand the usefulness and

Abstract = {{City governments around the world are developing and expanding how they
   connect to citizens. Technologies play an important role in making this
   connection, and one frequent way that cities connect with citizens is
   through 311-style request systems. 311 is a non-emergency municipal
   notification system that uses telephone, email, web forms, and

   of infrastructure issues and make requests for municipal services. In
   many ways, this process of citizen contribution mirrors the provision of

   generated content. This research presents a case study of the city of
   Edmonton, Canada, an early adopter of multi-channel 311 service request
   systems, including telephone, email, web form, and mobile app 311
   request channels. Three methods of analysis are used to characterize and
   compare these different channels over three years of request data; a
   comparison of relative request share for each channel, a spatial hot
   spot analysis, and regression models to compare channel usage with
   sociodemographic variables. The results of this study indicate a shift
   in channel usage from traditional to Internet-enabled, that this shift
   is mirrored in the hotspots of request activity, and that specific
   digital inequalities exist that reinforce this distinction between

Journal = {{URBAN PLANNING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{32-48}},
Abstract = {{High density residential development in metropolitan Melbourne, where
   contradictory imperatives of neighbourhood character and urban
   intensification play important roles, remains an uncertain practice. One
   key issue for plan implementation is the lack of consistency between
   authorities, developers and the community in interpreting the standards,
   design guidelines, and state/local strategies, especially those relating
   to neighbourhood character. There is currently no mechanism to
   incorporate community perceptions and place experiences as subjective
   aspects of neighbourhood character in development assessments. There is
   also little use of micro-scale and multi-dimensional spatial analysis to
   integrate these subjective aspects with objective measures (e.g.
   building volume and height; streetscape) to communicate effectively-and
   in a limited timeframe-with all stakeholders. This paper explores the
   potential of two emerging geospatial technologies that can be leveraged
   to respond to these problems. Evidence in the literature suggests that
   volunteered geographic information (VGI) can provide community input
   around subjective aspects of the urban environment. In addition, a
   deluge of three-dimensional (3D) spatial information (e.g. 3D city
   models) is increasingly available for micro-level (building-or
   property-level) assessment of the physical aspects of the urban
   environment. This paper formulates and discusses a conceptual framework
   to link these two spatial technological advancements in a virtual
   geographic environment (VGE) that accounts for micro-scale 3D spatial
   analysis incorporating both subjective and objective aspects of
   neighbourhood character relevant in implementing compact city
   strategies.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an original approach to dynamic anomalous behavior
   detection in individual trajectory using a recursive Bayesian filter.
   The anomalous pattern detection is of great interest for navigation,
   driver assistance systems, surveillance as well as crisis management. In
   this work, we focus on the GPS trajectories of automobiles finding where
   the driver's behavior shows anomalies. Such anomalous behaviors can
   happen in many cases, especially when the driver encounters orientation
   problems, i.e., taking a wrong turn, performing a detour, or losing the
   way. First, three high-level features, i.e., turns and their density,
   detour factor, and route repetition are extracted from the given
   trajectory geometry, for which a long-term perspective is required to
   observe data sequences of a significant length instead of individual
   time stamps. We therefore employ high-order Markov chains with a dynamic
   memory' to model the trajectory integrating these long-term features.
   The Markov model is processed by a proposed recursive Bayesian filter to
   infer an optimal probability distribution of the potential anomalous
   driving behaviors dynamically over time. The filter performs
   unsupervised detection in single trajectories based on local features
   only. No training process is required to characterize the anomalous
   behaviors. By analyzing the detection results of individual
   trajectories, collective behaviors can be derived indicating traffic
   issues such as congestions and turn restrictions. Experiments are
   performed on volunteered geographic information (VGI) data,
   self-acquired trajectories, and open trajectory datasets to demonstrate
   the potential of the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{In crowdsourced cartographic projects, mappers coordinate their efforts
   through online tools to produce digital geospatial artefacts, such as
   maps and gazetteers, which were once the exclusive territory of
   professional surveyors and cartographers. In order to produce meaningful
   and coherent data, contributors need to negotiate a shared
   conceptualisation that defines the domain concepts, such as road,
   building, train station, forest and lake, enabling the communication of
   geographic knowledge. Considering the OpenStreetMap Wiki website as a
   case study, this article investigates the nature of this negotiation,
   driven by a small group of mappers in a context of high contribution
   inequality. Despite the apparent consensus on the conceptualisation, the
   negotiation keeps unfolding in a tension between alternative
   representations, which are often incommensurable, i.e., hard to
   integrate and reconcile. In this study, we identify six complementary
   dimensions of incommensurability that recur in the negotiation: (1)
   ontology, (2) cartography, (3) culture and language, (4) lexical
   definitions, (5) granularity, and (6) semantic overload and duplication.}},

Abstract = {{OpenStreetMap (OSM) represents one of the most well-known examples of a
   collaborative mapping project. Major research efforts have so far dealt
   with data quality analysis but the modality of OSM's evolution across
   space and time has barely been noted. This study aims to analyze
   spatio-temporal patterns of contributions in OSM by proposing a
   contribution index (CI) in order to investigate the dynamism of OSM. The
   CI is based on a per cell analysis of the node quantity, interactivity,
   semantics, and attractivity (the ability to attract contributors).
   Additionally this research explores whether OSM has been constantly
   attracting new users and contributions or if OSM has experienced a
   decline in its ability to attract continued contributions. Using the
   Stuttgart region of Germany as a case study the empirical findings of
   the CI over time confirm that since 2007, OSM has been constantly
   attracting new users, who create new features, edit the existing spatial
   objects, and enrich them with attributes. This rate has been
   dramatically growing since 2011. The utilization of a Cellular
   Automata-Markov (CA-Markov) model provides evidence that by the end of
   2016 and 2020, the rise of CI will spread out over the study area and
   only a few cells without OSM features will remain.}},

Abstract = {{Our lives are affected by myriads of events happening daily all over the
   world. For efficient planning and management of complex systems composed
   of various components, understanding relationships between an event and
   the reactive behaviour of involved components is vital. Analysing these
   complex relations demands a spatiotemporal event-based model, in which
   the event plays a central role. In this article we develop a framework
   which provides the possibility of mapping and storing event-related
   information on the OpenStreetMap (OSM) platform by volunteers. The study
   is divided into two different phases: first, mapping the event elements
   by adding new attributes adequately designed to encode spatiotemporal
   and semantic event information; and, second, representing the
   event-related information on a map by developing a Web application,
   offering a volunteered location-based service. To facilitate the
   event-mapping procedure, a Java OpenStreetMap (JOSM) plug-in was
   developed for volunteers. The plug-in was developed based on the notion
   of an event to adequately store and manipulate the semantic information
   of events in the OSM structure. The tool was used by more than 100
   volunteers in Munich for the years 2012 to 2014. In addition to manual
   collection of event-related information by volunteers, a crawling
   framework was also developed to automatically collect freely available
   event information from various Web pages on the Internet. The framework
   extracts the same event elements as the plug-in. But the framework
   crawls each Web page according to some pre-defined rules and follows a
   post-processing step, if necessary. The manually collected events along
   with the crawled event information are visualized in a Web application.
   The study revealed that adding the possibility of event-oriented mapping
   to OSM empowers volunteers to collect a higher level of information
   (event information) for city maps. This information can furthermore be
   used for strategy development and service planning by decision-makers.}},

Abstract = {{OpenStreetMap is a geographic information platform designed to provide
   real-time updates and user-generated content related to its freely
   available global map, and it is one of the most widely used examples of
   volunteered geographic information, a technique associated with
   so-called neogeography. This paper, based on the data from Chinas
   OpenStreetMap road network in May 2014, taking 340 prefecture-level
   cities in China as its study area, presents the geometric-related (road
   density) and attribute-related (type diversity) spatial patterns of the
   OpenStreetMap road network, and explores their relationship. The results
   are as follows. (1) The distribution of OpenStreetMap road density in
   Shenzhen, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Macao predominantly obeys a positive
   skewness distribution. OpenStreetMap data for eastern China shows a
   higher overall and circular structure. In central China, there are
   noticeable discrepancies in the road density, whereas in western China,
   the road density is low. (2) The OpenStreetMap road diversity shows a
   normal distribution. The spatial pattern for the so-called Hu Huanyong
   line was broken by the effect of diplomatic and strategic factors,
   showing a high diversity along the peripheral border, coastal cities,
   and core inland cites. (3) Chinas OpenStreetMap is partitioned into four
   parts according to road density and diversity: high density and high
   diversity; low density and low diversity; high density and low
   diversity; and low density high diversity. (4) The OpenStreetMap
   geographical information-collection process and mechanism were analyzed,
   demonstrating that the road density reflects the preponderance of
   traffic in the real world. OpenStreetMap road diversity reflects the
   road-related geographic information demand and value, and it also
   reflects the interests of users toward to OpenStreetMap geographical
   information. (C) 2015 The Authors. Production and Hosting by Elsevier

Abstract = {{OpenStreetMap (OSM) has seen an exponential increase in the last few

   high rate of overnight stays, high number of foreigners, and residents
   aged from 18 to 69 are more likely to be involved in OSM. Furthermore,

Abstract = {{Crowdsourcing is a popular means of acquiring data, but the use of such

   cartography and geographical sciences more generally, with the quality
   of volunteered geographic information (VGI) recognized as a major
   challenge to address if the full potential of citizen sensing in mapping
   applications is to be realized. Here, a means to characterize the
   quality of volunteers, based only on the data they contribute, was used
   to explore issues connected with the quantity and quality of volunteers
   for attribute mapping. The focus was on data in the form of annotations
   or class labels provided by volunteers who visually interpreted an
   attribute, land cover, from a series of satellite sensor images. A
   latent class model was found to be able to provide accurate
   characterizations of the quality of volunteers in terms of the accuracy
   of their labelling, irrespective of the number of cases that they
   labelled. The accuracy with which a volunteer could be characterized
   tended to increase with the number of volunteers contributing but was
   typically good at all but small numbers of volunteers. Moreover, the
   ability to characterize volunteers in terms of the quality of their
   labelling could be used constructively. For example, volunteers could be
   ranked in terms of quality which could then be used to select a sub-set
   as input to a subsequent mapping task. This was particularly important
   as an identified subset of volunteers could undertake a task more
   accurately than when part of a larger group of volunteers. The results
   highlight that both the quantity and quality of volunteers need
   consideration and that the use of VGI may be enhanced through
   information on the quality of the volunteers derived entirely from the

Abstract = {{Recent improvements in online information communication and mobile
   location-aware technologies have led to the production of large volumes
   of volunteered geographic information. Widespread, large-scale efforts
   by volunteers to collect data can inform and drive scientific advances
   in diverse fields, including ecology and climatology. Traditional
   workflows to check the quality of such volunteered information can be
   costly and time consuming as they heavily rely on human interventions.
   However, identifying factors that can influence data quality, such as
   inconsistency, is crucial when these data are used in modeling and
   decision- making frameworks. Recently developed workflows use simple
   statistical approaches that assume that the majority of the information
   is consistent. However, this assumption is not generalizable, and
   ignores underlying geographic and environmental contextual variability
   that may explain apparent inconsistencies. Here we describe an automated
   workflow to check inconsistency based on the availability of contextual
   environmental information for sampling locations. The workflow consists
   of three steps: (1) dimensionality reduction to facilitate further
   analysis and interpretation of results, (2) model-based clustering to
   group observations according to their contextual conditions, and (3)
   identification of inconsistent observations within each cluster. The
   workflow was applied to volunteered observations of flowering in common
   and cloned lilac plants (Syringa vulgaris and Syringa x chinensis) in
   the United States for the period 1980 to 2013. About 97\% of the
   observations for both common and cloned lilacs were flagged as
   consistent, indicating that volunteers provided reliable information for
   this case study. Relative to the original dataset, the exclusion of
   inconsistent observations changed the apparent rate of change in lilac
   bloom dates by two days per decade, indicating the importance of
   inconsistency checking as a key step in data quality assessment for
   volunteered geographic information. Initiatives that leverage
   volunteered geographic information can adapt this workflow to improve
   the quality of their datasets and the robustness of their scientific
   analyses.}},

Abstract = {{The vast accumulation of environmental data and the rapid development of
   geospatial visualization and analytical techniques make it possible for
   scientists to solicit information from local citizens to map spatial
   variation of geographic phenomena. However, data provided by citizens
   (referred to as citizen data in this article) suffer two limitations for
   mapping: bias in spatial coverage and imprecision in spatial location.
   This article presents an approach to minimizing the impacts of these two
   limitations of citizen data using geospatial analysis techniques. The
   approach reduces location imprecision by adopting a frequency-sampling
   strategy to identify representative presence locations from areas over
   which citizens observed the geographic phenomenon. The approach
   compensates for the spatial bias by weighting presence locations with
   cumulative visibility (the frequency at which a given location can be
   seen by local citizens). As a case study to demonstrate the principle,
   this approach was applied to map the habitat suitability of the
   black-and-white snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus bieti) in Yunnan,
   China. Sightings of R. bieti were elicited from local citizens using a
   geovisualization platform and then processed with the proposed approach
   to predict a habitat suitability map. Presence locations of R. bieti
   recorded by biologists through intensive field tracking were used to
   validate the predicted habitat suitability map. Validation showed that
   the continuous Boyce index (B-cont(0.1)) calculated on the suitability
   map was 0.873 (95\% CI: {[}0.810, 0.917]), indicating that the map was
   highly consistent with the field-observed distribution of R. bieti.
   B-cont(0.1) was much lower (0.173) for the suitability map predicted
   based on citizen data when location imprecision was not reduced and even
   lower (-0.048) when there was no compensation for spatial bias. This
   indicates that the proposed approach effectively minimized the impacts
   of location imprecision and spatial bias in citizen data and therefore
   effectively improved the quality of mapped spatial variation using
   citizen data. It further implies that, with the application of
   geospatial analysis techniques to properly account for limitations in
   citizen data, valuable information embedded in such data can be
   extracted and used for scientific mapping.}},

   geolocalization of user-generated photographs and videos, one must first
   populate a geographic database with the different types of objects and

   Toward that end, this paper presents a framework for detecting and
   labeling objects in satellite imagery. The objects that we are
   interested in are characterized by low-level features that exist mostly
   at or beyond the limits of spatial resolution in the satellite images.
   To deal with the challenges posed by the extraction of such features
   from satellite imagery, we confine our search to the vicinity of the
   OpenStreetMap (OSM) delineated roads in a geographic area. The OSM roads
   are projected into the satellite images through inverse
   orthorectification. As an illustration of the performance of the object
   detection framework presented in this paper, our system can detect
   pedestrian cross-walks in a 200 000 sq. km. region of Australia (that is
   covered by 222 satellite images) with a recall rate of 63\% and a

Abstract = {{The exponential adoption of smartphones affords the general public
   access to tools (sensors) that were once only available to highly
   trained scientists and geospatial technicians. This provides more people
   with opportunities to contribute and consume information relevant to
   their current location. Geographers have been applying critical theory
   to examine privacy implications associated with constant locational
   aware smartphone usage while applied researchers are measuring spatial
   cognitive abilities using empirically bound approaches. What remains
   unknown is how smartphone users perceive implications associated with
   privacy and spatial cognitive abilities as a result of smartphone use
   for location based queries. An online survey was administered to collect
   perceptions related to these issues from the general smartphone-using
   public. It was found that while participants were mindful of privacy
   concerns associated with smartphone use, they reported that perceived
   benefits of smartphone use outweigh associated costs. Additionally, the
   majority of the participants found that their smartphones provided them
   with confidence in way-finding tasks rather than hindering them as some
   literature suggests. Through this study we aim to describe how a lack of
   understanding of the general publics' perceptions of smartphone usage
   may be limiting contemporary theory and practice within volunteered
   geographic information and location based services related research
   associated with geography.}},

Pages = {{187-197}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, we have seen the emergence of sound mapping, through
   which users can share their recordings of sounds via online mapping
   platforms. These practices are enabled by an array of spatial and
   digital technologies that also facilitate the growth of the so-called
   volunteered geographic information (VGI) regarding contributions from
   users without training in conventional GIS or cartography. In the
   growing body of work on VGI, however, not much attention has been given
   to the emergence of such sound maps as part of the VGI constructions.
   Meanwhile, research in soundscape has not addressed the aspect of
   crowd-sourcing or user-generated contributions facilitated by new
   information and communication technologies. This article seeks to bridge
   this gap. It draws upon important insights from critical GIS research
   into investigating VGI as visual practices, while it is also informed by
   three areas of soundscape research including mapping soundscapes,
   tracing the production of soundscapes and exploring embodied experiences
   with soundscapes. Through an empirical case in China, this article
   suggests a two-level analytical framework: investigating in what ways
   crowd-sourced sound maps emerge and interpreting these sounds on their
   shared platforms. In so doing, this study calls for more engagement with
   the multi-modality aspect of visuality in mappings, which in turn may
   have implications for landscape design and planning. In this way, it
   seeks to enrich the discussion on critical visualization. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Main road features extracted from remotely sensed imagery play an
   important role in many civilian and military applications, such as

   extracting main roads from high-resolution grayscale imagery based on
   directional mathematical morphology and prior knowledge obtained from
   the Volunteered Geographic Information found in the OpenStreetMap. The
   two salient steps in this strategy are: (1) using directional
   mathematical morphology to enhance the contrast between roads and
   non-roads; (2) using OpenStreetMap roads as prior knowledge to segment
   the remotely sensed imagery. Experiments were conducted on two ZiYuan-3
   images and one QuickBird high-resolution grayscale image to compare our
   proposed method to other commonly used techniques for road feature
   extraction. The results demonstrated the validity and better performance

Abstract = {{Tornadoes have the potential to cause significant destruction and loss
   of life in many regions across Canada. Accordingly, these hazards are
   essential to consider for a comprehensive emergency management plan.
   Following a suspected tornadic event, damage surveys are conducted by
   Environment Canada to determine the extent and severity of damage in
   order to assign an Enhanced Fujita scale rating. The purpose of this
   paper is to investigate the process involved in conducting storm damage
   surveys, and to assess how information gathered during these surveys is
   used. Primary research for this study involved conducting
   semi-structured interviews with Environment Canada damage surveyors from
   various provinces (n=10) and wind engineering researchers from a large
   public university in Canada (n = 2), as well as an onsite observation of
   a damage survey conducted in Angus, Ontario after a tornado struck on 17
   June 2014. The results of this study underscored the subtle but
   important differences between storm damage surveys conducted in the
   United States and Canada. It was also found that the majority of damage
   surveys are now conducted remotely through photos, videos, and telephone
   interviews with key witnesses. Finally, damage surveys were found to be
   a critical component of the disaster management cycle by contributing to
   both risk reduction and preparedness. Introducing sophisticated
   technologies such as mobile devices and applications, as well as using
   volunteered geographic information to display damage reports on a

Abstract = {{Small-scale data on dwellings and population density are required for
   precise geospatial urban modelling. Further, knowledge of building usage
   is necessary to model socio-economic aspects such as the distribution of
   dwellings and population. In an effort to limit costs and resourcing
   efforts, users and institutes in research and spatial planning are
   developing strategies to extract such information from existing
   geographic base data. Currently, land-use information from official
   datasets merely distinguishes residential from non-residential building
   usage, but cannot identify areas of non-residential usage inside
   residential buildings. Additional data sources are therefore needed to
   fill this gap. In this paper we propose an approach to process semantic
   information from user-generated OpenStreetMap (OSM) data to specify
   non-residential usage in residential buildings. This estimation is based
   on OSM attributes, so-called tags, which are used to define the extent
   of non-residential usage. Our objective is to identify the potentials
   and reveal the limitations of integrating semantic OSM data for the
   evaluation of building usage. Official statistical data on dwellings and
   population is used to validate results. Thereby we prove the benefit of
   integrating OpenStreetMap semantic data to refine the estimation of
   non-residential floor area in the study area of the German City of

Abstract = {{User-generated content (UGC) that contains spatial references, often

   one increasingly prevalent source of these data, geographically encoded
   photographs, to capture spatial expressions of place in an urban
   environment. Geotagged photographs were obtained from the Flickr API to
   build a geographic database of photographs for the city of Vancouver,
   Canada from 2001-2012. These data were aggregated to multiple geographic
   units represented as hexagonal lattices. Spatial patterns of photo
   aggregation were examined for tessellations that ranged from 0.25 ha to
   1024 ha. Tags associated with each photo were also explored through the
   notion of `tag-space' at multiple resolutions, or ``scales{''}, of
   analysis through local log-odds ratios. Results indicate a significant
   interaction between tag-space semantics and spatial aggregation which
   suggests that consideration of scale effects should be integral to
   analysis of this type of tagged VGI for exploring citizens' sensing of
   urban environments. The results indicate further that we may have to
   reconsider the interaction between encoded meaning, the methods used for
   extracting such meaning from tag-space, and exogenous and endogenous

Abstract = {{Geotagged photos on social media like Flickr explicitly indicate the
   trajectories of tourists. They can be employed to reveal the tourists'
   preference on landmarks and routings of tourism. Most of existing works
   on routing searches are based on the trajectories of GPS-enabled
   devices' users. From a distinct point of view, we attempt to propose a
   novel approach in which the basic unit of routing is separate road
   segment instead of GPS trajectory segment. In this paper, we build a
   recommendation system that provides users with the most popular
   landmarks as well as the best travel routings between the landmarks. By
   using Flickr geotaggged photos, the top ranking travel destinations in a
   city can be identified and then the best travel routes between the
   popular travel destinations are recommended. We apply a spatial
   clustering method to identify the main travel landmarks and subsequently
   rank these landmarks. Using machine learning method, we calculate the
   tourism popularity of the road in terms of relevant parameters, e.g.,
   the number of users and the number of Point-of-Interests. These
   popularity assessments are integrated into the routing recommendation
   system. The routing recommendation system takes into consideration both
   the popularity assessment and the length of the road. The best route
   recommended to the user minimizes the distance while including maximal
   tourism popularity. Experiments were conducted in two different
   scenarios. The empirical results show that the recommendation system is
   able to provide the user good travel planning including both top ranking
   landmarks and suitable routings in a city. Besides, the system offers

Abstract = {{Recent disasters, such as the 2010 Haiti earthquake, have drawn

   such as Twitter, citizens create Volunteered Geographic Information
   (VGI). To effectively use this information for disaster management, we
   developed a VGI framework for the discovery of VGI. This framework
   consists of four components: (i) a VGI brokering module to provide a
   standard service interface to retrieve VGI from multiple resources based
   on spatial, temporal, and semantic parameters; (ii) a VGI quality
   control component, which employs semantic filtering and
   cross-referencing techniques to evaluate VGI; (iii) a VGI publisher
   module, which uses a service-based delivery mechanism to disseminate

Abstract = {{Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) such as data derived from the
   OpenStreetMap (OSM) project is a popular data source for freely

   data. This fact is frequently a cause of concern regarding the quality
   and usability of such data. In this study, the quality of OSM land use
   and land cover (LULC) data is investigated for an area in southern
   Germany. Two spatial data quality elements, thematic accuracy and
   completeness are addressed by comparing the OSM data with an
   authoritative German reference dataset. The results show that the kappa
   value indicates a substantial agreement between the OSM and the
   authoritative dataset. Nonetheless, for our study region, there are
   clear variations between the LULC classes. Forest covers a large area
   and shows both a high OSM completeness (97.6\%) and correctness
   (95.1\%). In contrast, farmland also covers a large area, but for this
   class OSM shows a low completeness value (45.9\%) due to unmapped areas.
   Additionally, the results indicate that a high population density, as
   present in urbanized areas, seems to denote a higher strength of
   agreement between OSM and the DLM (Digital Landscape Model). However, a
   low population density does not necessarily imply a low strength of

Abstract = {{Spatial data are fundamental for borderland analyses of geography,
   natural resources, demography, politics, economy, and culture. As the
   spatial data used in borderland research usually cover the borderland
   regions of several neighboring countries, it is difficult for anyone
   research institution of government to collect them. Volunteered
   Geographic Information (VGI) is a highly successful method for acquiring
   timely and detailed global spatial data at a very low cost. Therefore,
   VGI is a reasonable source of borderland spatial data. OpenStreetMap
   (OSM) is known as the most successful VGI resource. However, OSM's data
   model is far different from the traditional geographic information
   model. Thus, the OSM data must be converted in the scientist's
   customized data model. Because the real world changes rapidly, the
   converted data must be updated incrementally. Therefore, this paper
   presents a method used to dynamically integrate OSM data into the
   borderland database. In this method, a basic transformation rule base is
   formed by comparing the OSM Map Feature description document and the
   destination model definitions. Using the basic rules, the main features
   can be automatically converted to the destination model. A
   human-computer interaction model transformation and a
   rule/automatic-remember mechanism are developed to interactively
   transfer the unusual features that cannot be transferred by the basic
   rules to the target model and to remember the reusable rules
   automatically. To keep the borderland database current, the global
   OsmChange daily diff file is used to extract the change-only information
   for the research region. To extract the changed objects in the region
   under study, the relationship between the changed object and the
   research region is analyzed considering the evolution of the involved
   objects. In addition, five rules are determined to select the objects
   and integrate the changed objects with multi-versions over time. The
   objects' change-type evolution is analyzed, and seven rules are used to
   determine the change-type of the changed objects. Based on these rules
   and algorithms, we programmed an automatic (or semi-automatic)
   integrating and updating prototype system for the borderland database.
   The developed system was intensively tested using OSM data for Vietnam
   and Pakistan as the experimental data.}},

Abstract = {{There currently exists a wide variety of online resources providing
   mapping infrastructures and geographic information. Most web-based map
   services, such as Google Maps, Yahoo! Maps and Bing Maps, are mostly
   based on data that is collected by authoritative mapping agencies.
   Alternatively, some relatively new web-map services, such as
   OpenStreetMap (OSM) and Wikimapia, are mostly based on volunteered data
   collected by the public (e.g. crowdsourced mapping). Although such
   volunteered-based map services platforms show an increasing planimetric
   (2D) accuracy, completeness and update-rate of their mapping
   infrastructure, surprisingly enough, there is a lack of comparable data
   and accuracy measures in respect to the third dimension, i.e. height;
   more specifically, the topographic representation that is based on the
   volunteered collected data. Most of these web services still rely on
   existing open-source authoritative topographic infrastructures, and not
   on data collected by the volunteers. Moreover, topographic information
   that is open to the public and is free to use, e.g. advanced spaceborne
   thermal emission and reflection radiometer and shuttle radar topography
   mission, is regularly available with relatively low height accuracy (not
   better than 5 m) and low planimetric resolution (over 30 m). Volunteered
   data, on the other hand, collected by individuals that are situated `all
   over' the globe can offer with new capabilities and data characteristics
   having potentially higher qualities. This research proposes to examine
   the feasibility of using crowdsourced volunteered geographic information
   working paradigm for the task of producing a reliable digital terrain
   model (DTM) infrastructure for general use. This is achieved by
   collecting GPS observations that are available from VG data sources,
   while applying a 2D Kalman filter-based algorithm, aimed at reducing
   noise and ambiguities. This paper presents this methodology, with
   preliminary analysis results achieved by this implementation, showing
   the feasibility of this working methodology, having good results and
   accuracy of the DTM generated.}},

Abstract = {{The scope of the paper is to test if the online dynamic maps such as the

   paper presents the possibilities and the perspectives of OSM for spatial
   and attribute cadastral data collection and storage for the compilation
   of draft cadastral maps as an alternative methodology within the terms
   of the volunteered geographic information (VGI). The authors carried out
   a practical experiment in an extended part of the historic city centre
   of Athens and updated the online dynamic map of OSM with attribute and
   spatial cadastral data. Surveying students explored the capacities of
   the dynamic map in two steps: (a) in a section where the polygons of the
   buildings already existed on the map, they had to improve it with
   attribute data, and (b) in another section where no relevant polygons
   existed, a spatial and attribute data enhancement was required. The
   research was based on the various approaches that each student adopted
   and the freedom that the OSM offers to the users. The results show that
   users can easily distinguish the differences in capacities between the
   OSM and the commercial software; the inexpensive, easy to use and quick
   methodology of the OSM in contrast to the accurate, authoritative and
   assured methodology of the commercial software.}},

Abstract = {{As of 2010, 90\% of the data that existed in the world were created
   within the previous 2 years, while personal location data have been
   singled out as one of the five primary `big data' streams in the 2011
   McKinsey report. By 2020, the volume of existing data will increase by
   50-fold, where a large percentage of this volume will be associated with
   geospatial data. One of the reasons for this is the existence of the
   volunteered geographic information (VGI) paradigm, which encapsulates
   the idea of using the Internet (Web 2.0) to create, share, visualise,
   and analyse geographic information and knowledge. This neogeography
   revolution has started to fundamentally transform how geographic data
   are acquired, maintained, analysed, visualised, and consequently used.
   Thus, it has the potential to influence common practices, since it
   captures abroad knowledge of the environment we live in, in all aspects
   of life, encompassing new services to take place, applications and
   processes to be developed - all of which are location based. The
   diversity of applications and services that explore the potential of VGI
   argues for its current usability relevance: ranging from transportation
   network analysis, to air pollution and air quality, to natural disaster
   decision-making systems. This revolution has contributed to the
   development of two important working and knowledge paradigms:
   Crowdsourcing and Wisdom of the Crowd, widely used today within the
   mapping and geo-information discipline. Still, both terms are commonly
   misused and replaced. This paper aims at distinguishing between the
   terms via the quantitative and theoretical examination of four widely
   used social location-based services: OpenStreetMap (OSM), Moovit, Waze
   and Ushahidi. Eight primary characteristics that influence the paradigm
   of both Crowdsourcing and Wisdom of the Crowd are defined and examined,
   aiming to investigate and emphasise the differences between the four,
   namely: diversity, decentralisation, independency, aggregation,
   knowledge, activity, privacy and exploitation. It was found that OSM is
   an excellent example of a Crowdsourcing service, while though Ushahidi
   is considered as a Crowdsourcing service, its characteristics are
   coupled better with those of Wisdom of the Crowd. Moovit and Waze do not
   correspond to the Crowdsourcing paradigm, and thus are categorised as
   Wisdom of the Crowd services.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last few years, much online volunteered geographic information
   (VGI) has emerged and has been increasingly analyzed to understand
   places and cities, as well as human mobility and activity. However,
   there are concerns about the quality and usability of such VGI. In this
   study, we demonstrate a complete process that comprises the collection,
   unification, classification and validation of a type of VGI online
   point-of-interest (POI) data-and develop methods to utilize such POI
   data to estimate, disaggregated land use (i.e., employment size by
   category) at a very high spatial resolution (census block level) using
   part of the Boston metropolitan area as an example. With recent advances
   in activity-based land use, transportation, and environment (LUTE)
   models, such disaggregated land use data become important to allow LUTE
   models to analyze and simulate a person's choices of work location and
   activity destinations and to understand policy impacts on future cities.
   These data can also be used as alternatives to explore economic
   activities at the local level, especially as government-published
   census-based disaggregated employment data have become less available in
   the recent decade. Our new approach provides opportunities for cities to
   estimate land use at high resolution with low cost by utilizing VGI
   while ensuring its quality with a certain accuracy threshold. The
   automatic classification of POI can also be utilized for other types of
   analyses on cities. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) and urban forests have recently
   become topics of increasing interest in the social sciences. While
   social and environmental justice concerns have been applied to each of
   these topics individually, this paper addresses VGI, urban forests, and
   social justice simultaneously. VGI has often been hailed as an
   empowering and democratic new form of citizen science that allows data
   collection tasks to be distributed to a large group of people; however,
   concerns have emerged about whose geographies will be volunteered, and
   for what purpose. This research addresses these concerns, with an
   understanding that VGI has the potential to strengthen, rather than
   dissolve the digital divide. This is accomplished by determining the
   completeness of coverage of user-generated urban forest mapping on the
   interactive website PhillyTreeMap (http://www.phillytreemap.org/) by
   comparing it with high resolution remotely sensed canopy coverage data.
   These coverage levels are then regressed against Census demographic data
   at the block group level to determine if there are inequities in the
   coverage of this urban forest VGI project based upon socioeconomic
   status. Results indicate that sociodemographic variables influence the
   likelihood of increased coverage of the VGI urban forest data,
   presenting equity concerns surrounding the coverage of this VGI urban
   forest data. The presence of these social and environmental justice
   concerns indicates the need for expanded research into this new frontier
   of geographic data. Geographically weighted general linear models show
   non-stationarity in the relationships between VGI coverage and
   sociodemographic predictors, demonstrating the importance of
   incorporating local models. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Due to its relatively high availability and low cost, location-based
   social network (LBSN) (e.g., Foursquare) data (a popular type of
   volunteered geographic information) seem to be an alternative or
   complement to survey data in the study of travel behavior and activity
   analysis. Illustrating this situation, recently, a number of studies
   attempted to use LBSN data (e.g., Foursquare check-ins) to investigate
   patterns of human travel and activity. Of particular note is that
   compared to other individual-level characteristics of users, such as
   age, profession, education, income and so forth, gender is relatively
   highly available in the profiles of Foursquare users. Moreover,
   considering gender differences in travel and activity analysis is a
   popular research topic and is helpful in better understanding the
   changes in women's roles in family, labor force participation, society
   and so forth. Therefore, this paper empirically investigates how gender
   influences the travel and activity patterns of active local Foursquare
   users in New York City. Empirical investigations of gender differences
   in travel and activity patterns are conducted at both the individual and
   aggregate level. The empirical results reveal that there are gender
   differences in the travel and activity patterns of active local users in
   New York City at both the individual and aggregate level. Finally, the
   results of the empirical study and the extent to which LBSN data can be
   exploited to produce travel diary data are discussed.}},

   geometric differences and topological inconsistencies that need to be
   addressed. In this paper, we provide a methodology for integrating
   pedestrian facilities and obstructions information with an existing PND.
   At first we extracted the significant points from user-collected GPS
   trajectory by identifying the geometric difference index and attributes
   of each point. Then the extracted points were used to make an initial
   solution of the matching between the trajectory and the PND. Two
   geometrical algorithms were proposed and applied to reduce two kinds of
   errors in the matching: on dual lines and on intersections. Using the
   final solution for the matching, we reconstructed the node/link
   structure of PND including the facilities and obstructions information.
   Finally, performance was assessed with a test site and 79.2\% of the
   collected data were correctly integrated with the PND.}},

Abstract = {{The proliferation of volunteered geographic information (VGI), such as
   OpenStreetMap (OSM) enabled by technological advancements, has led to
   large volumes of user-generated geographical content. While this data is
   becoming widely used, the understanding of the quality characteristics
   of such data is still largely unexplored. An open research question is
   the relationship between demographic indicators and VGI quality. While
   earlier studies have suggested a potential relationship between VGI
   quality and population density or socio-economic characteristics of an
   area, such relationships have not been rigorously explored, and mainly
   remained qualitative in nature. This paper addresses this gap by
   quantifying the relationship between demographic properties of a given
   area and the quality of VGI contributions. We study specifically the
   demographic characteristics of the mapped area and its relation to two
   dimensions of spatial data quality, namely positional accuracy and
   completeness of the corresponding VGI contributions with respect to OSM
   using the Denver (Colorado, US) area as a case study. We use non-spatial
   and spatial analysis techniques to identify potential associations among
   demographics data and the distribution of positional and completeness
   errors found within VGI data. Generally, the results of our study show a
   lack of statistically significant support for the assumption that
   demographic properties affect the positional accuracy or completeness of
   VGI. While this research is focused on a specific area, our results
   showcase the complex nature of the relationship between VGI quality and
   demographics, and highlights the need for a better understanding of it.
   By doing so, we add to the debate of how demographics impact on the
   quality of VGI data and lays the foundation to further work.}},

   on a website, by means of a test that only a human could solve. Second,
   the effort of the user for this test is used to generate additional
   information, e.g., digitization of books or identification of house
   numbers. In this work, we present a concept for adapting the reCAPTCHA
   idea to create user-generated geographic information from earth
   observation data, and the requirements during the conception and
   implementation are depicted in detail. Furthermore, the essential parts
   of a Geo-reCAPTCHA system are described, and afterwards transferred, to
   a prototype implementation. An empirical user study is conducted to
   investigate the Geo-reCAPTCHA approach, assessing time and quality of
   the resulting geographic information. Our results show that a
   Geo-reCAPTCHA can be solved by the users of our study on building
   digitization in a short amount of time (19.2 s on average) with an
   overall average accuracy of the digitizations of 82.2\%. In conclusion,
   Geo-reCAPTCHA has the potential to be a reasonable alternative to the
   typical reCAPTCHA, and to become a new data-rich channel of crowdsourced
   geographic information. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in Web technologies have opened avenues to create
   socio-technical platforms that can empower citizens in urban planning
   processes. The rise of the GeoWeb and the popularity of Web 2.0
   collaborative tools can facilitate the development of a new generation
   of bottom-up Public Participatory GIS (PPGIS) platforms that can
   incorporate user-generated content into Spatial Data Infrastructures
   (SDIs). New service-based delivery mechanisms can provide architectural
   flexibility and adaptability, and enable the public to benefit from
   ubiquitous information access. From an e-participation perspective, Web
   2.0 social networking functions support interactive communication among
   various PPGIS stakeholders, e.g., citizens, planners, and decision
   makers. The main contribution of this article is to present a reference
   architecture for e-planning platforms that (1) facilitates effective
   e-participation by allowing multidirectional map-based communication
   among various land development stakeholders (e.g., planners, decision
   makers, citizens, etc.), and (2) enables incorporation of visualization,
   evaluation, and discussion capabilities to support community planning
   processes. To achieve this, we developed a service-oriented architecture
   (SOA) that exploits SDI principles and Web 2.0 technologies. The
   platform architecture allows heterogeneous data sources, analytical
   functionality and tools, and presentation frameworks to be plugged into
   a coherent system to provide a planning and decision support platform.
   We present two real-world implementations of the proposed architecture
   that have been developed to support community engagement in the City of
   Calgary, Canada.}},

Abstract = {{Public Participatory GIS (PPGIS) is a very broad field, and because of
   the direct outgrowth addressing questions raised regarding inequitable
   access to GIS and its societal impacts, PPGIS has become an exhaustive
   research area. Over the past two decades, several PPGIS initiatives have
   taken place in the western and non-western world. Several avenues have
   opened up, but nonetheless, questions regarding the effectiveness of
   such initiatives remain to be answered. Current research addressing the
   societal and political impacts of GIS have witnessed novel use of the
   technology and specialized spatial data provision such as volunteered
   geographic information, neogeography, geoweb, and map 2.0 (Goodchild,
   2007; Elwood 2010; Sui 2008) and have received increased attention from
   GIS scholars (Goodchild 2007; Elwood 2009; Sui 2008). A common thread
   tying such specialized use of technology is the participation by
   citizens with little or no GIS training, a long standing objective of
   the PPGIS area of inquiry. So, as we move into an era that is
   gravitating rapidly toward more specialized use of technology built on a
   similar foundation, it seems timely to reflect on the effectiveness and
   sustainability of PPGIS initiatives. This article reviews the history of
   PPGIS, its genesis, and some of the critical work within the PPGIS
   research arena. Finally, the paper reflects on where PPGIS stands today.}},

Abstract = {{In this article we critically discuss the challenge of integrating
   contextual information, in particular spatiotemporal contextual
   information, with human and technical sensor information, which we
   approach from a geospatial perspective. We start by highlighting the
   significance of context in general and spatiotemporal context in
   particular and introduce a smart city model of interactions between
   humans, the environment, and technology, with context at the common
   interface. We then focus on both the intentional and the unintentional
   sensing capabilities of today's technologies and discuss current
   technological trends that we consider have the ability to enrich human
   and technical geo-sensor information with contextual detail. The
   different types of sensors used to collect contextual information are
   analyzed and sorted into three groups on the basis of names considering
   frequently used related terms, and characteristic contextual parameters.
   These three groups, namely technical in situ sensors, technical remote
   sensors, and human sensors are analyzed and linked to three dimensions
   involved in sensing (data generation, geographic phenomena, and type of
   sensing). In contrast to other scientific publications, we found a large
   number of technologies and applications using in situ and mobile
   technical sensors within the context of smart cities, and surprisingly
   limited use of remote sensing approaches. In this article we further
   provide a critical discussion of possible impacts and influences of both
   technical and human sensing approaches on society, pointing out that a
   larger number of sensors, increased fusion of information, and the use
   of standardized data formats and interfaces will not necessarily result
   in any improvement in the quality of life of the citizens of a smart
   city. This article seeks to improve our understanding of technical and
   human geo-sensing capabilities, and to demonstrate that the use of such
   sensors can facilitate the integration of different types of contextual
   information, thus providing an additional, namely the geo-spatial
   perspective on the future development of smart cities.}},

Abstract = {{Each year Australia is prone to potential negative and devastating

   Volunteered geographic information (VGI) is an emerging technology that

   Service, a survey of 154 participants across 12 communities at bushfire

Abstract = {{Effective flood risk management requires updated information to ensure
   that the correct decisions can be made. This can be provided by Wireless
   Sensor Networks (WSN) which are a low-cost means of collecting updated
   information about rivers. Another valuable resource is Volunteered
   Geographic Information (VGI) which is a comparatively new means of
   improving the coverage of monitored areas because it is able to supply
   supplementary information to the WSN and thus support decision-making in
   flood risk management. However, there still remains the problem of how
   to combine WSN data with VGI. In this paper, an attempt is made to
   investigate AGORA-DS, which is a Spatial Decision Support System (SDSS)
   that is able to make flood risk management more effective by combining
   these data sources, i.e. WSN with VGI. This approach is built over a
   conceptual model that complies with the interoperable standards laid
   down by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) - e.g. Sensor Observation
   Service (SOS) and Web Feature Service (WFS) - and seeks to combine and
   present unified information in a web-based decision support tool. This
   work was deployed in a real scenario of flood risk management in the
   town of So Carlos in Brazil. The evidence obtained from this deployment
   confirmed that interoperable standards can support the integration of
   data from distinct data sources. In addition, they also shqw that VG! is
   able to provide information about areas of the river basin which lack
   data since there is no appropriate station in the area. Hence it
   provides a valuable support for the WSN data. It can thus be concluded
   that AGORA-DS is able to combine information provided by WSN and VGI,
   and provide useful information for supporting flood risk management. (C)

Abstract = {{Numerous exegeses have been written about the epistemologies of

   Borgmann's philosophy of technology we offer a critique that, rather
   than appreciating the contours of this new form of data, truth appears
   to derive from traditional analytic views of information found within
   GIScience. This is assisted by structures that enable VGI to be treated
   as independent of the process that led to its creation. Allusions to
   individual emancipation further hamper VGI and problematise
   participatory practices in mapping/geospatial technologies (e.g. public

Abstract = {{Providing up-to-date and reliable dynamic traffic information has become
   a major challenge in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Current
   traffic information services employ participatory sensing and crowd
   sourcing techniques to provide dynamic traffic information consisting of
   estimated travel times and congestion warnings. In this paper we propose
   the crowd sensing system based on smartphones and integrated GPS and
   accelerometer sensors, to capture dynamic, short-lasting traffic events
   and drivers' aggressive and risky behavior like excessive breaking,
   sudden lane change, open turns, speed excess and route deviations. These
   traffic events can be categorized as risky driving situations or near
   accidents and are typically not included in any official traffic
   statistics. The system uses crowd intelligence based on participatory
   sensing paradigm and collaborative mechanisms to detect important
   traffic events/situations. It provides proactive notification and
   recommendations to drivers in the vicinity of, or on the route to
   reported events. The proposed crowd sensing system ensures information
   reliability through space-time clustering of reported events/situations
   while preserving drivers' privacy. We perform the evaluation of our
   system that demonstrates the effectiveness and usefulness of advanced
   navigation service based on it, that uses collected dynamic traffic
   events to provide warning and notifications to drivers and safest route
   navigation. This novel functionality of a navigation service enhances
   drivers' situational awareness, increasing safety and effectiveness of

Abstract = {{It is now common for researchers in natural resource management and

   new map is combined with household survey data to explore respondent's

   The results suggest that VGI can be a useful resource to researchers in

Abstract = {{Geo-located information is increasingly important for regional decision
   making and spatial assessment. Toronto has witnessed rapid demographic
   and economic change over the last decades, making the Toronto region the
   fourth largest economic centre in North America. From a policymaker's
   perspective, understanding land use for planning purposes is critical
   for better urban planning. Such information is, however, conditioned by
   classical surveying and sophisticated remote sensing techniques, which
   are often costly and spatially not feasible. Only local knowledge and
   information can really bridge this gap, as urban land use in denser
   urban regions is often very fine-grained information. Volunteered
   geo-information (VGI) sources are fundamental tools for the assessment
   of urban land use patterns. This article identifies land use patterns
   using VGI and offers a comparative assessment with traditionally
   classified land use features from remote sensing imagery for Toronto. A
   parcel-based analysis of the voluntarily shared spatial information is
   used and extended at a regional level, with an overall accuracy of 75
   percent. Additionally, a per-class analysis confirms which land classes
   can be well (or poorly) mapped, and what level of disagreement exists

Abstract = {{Crowdsourcing geospatial data mainly collected by public citizens have
   brought about a profound transformation on data acquisition and
   utilization. However, the unpredictable positional accuracies,
   unstructured semantic descriptions, and invalid spatial relations occur
   to crowdsourcing geospatial data, causing difficulties for conflating
   heterogeneous data sets collected by different professional agencies or
   volunteers. We thus propose a novel pattern-mining approach to conflate
   crowdsourcing road networks with points of interest (POIs) geometrically
   and semantically. The proposed method mines the geometric patterns
   between road networks and POIs respectively and generates the
   pattern-related skeleton graphs for them. Then, corresponding points are
   determined between the two skeleton graphs to align POIs and road
   networks geometrically, and the road-related semantic data between the
   associated POIs and the road segments are compared to check the data
   quality of POIs and infer the road names of the road segments.
   Experimental results show the advantages of our proposed method,
   demonstrating a functional and promising solution for enriching POIs and
   road network geometrically and semantically.}},

Abstract = {{Urban form and function have been studied extensively in urban planning
   and geographical information science. However, gaining a greater
   understanding of how they merge to define the urban morphology remains a
   substantial scientific challenge. Toward this goal, this paper addresses
   the opportunities presented by the emergence of crowdsourced data to
   gain novel insights into form and function in urban spaces. We are
   focusing in particular on information harvested from social media and
   other open-source and volunteered datasets (e.g. trajectory and
   OpenStreetMap data). These data provide a first-hand account of form and
   function from the people who define urban space through their
   activities. This novel bottom-up approach to study these concepts
   complements traditional urban studies to provide a new lens for studying
   urban activity. By synthesizing recent advancements in the analysis of
   open-source data, we provide a new typology for characterizing the role
   of crowdsourcing in the study of urban morphology. We illustrate this
   new perspective by showing how social media, trajectory, and traffic
   data can be analyzed to capture the evolving nature of a city's form and
   function. While these crowd contributions may be explicit or implicit in
   nature, they are giving rise to an emerging research agenda for
   monitoring, analyzing, and modeling form and function for urban design

   The practice of private citizens generating online geospatial data
   presents new opportunities for the creation and dissemination of

   information for disaster management at a fraction of the resource costs

   explore and understand the implications of these data and data practices
   for disaster management. In this article, we review the current state of
   knowledge in this emerging field and present recommendations for future
   research. Significantly, we note further research is warranted in the
   pre-event phases of disaster management, where VGI may present an
   opportunity to connect and engage individuals in disaster preparation

   land rights, or just reflections of institutional isomorphism?}},
Journal = {{SURVEY REVIEW}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{47}},

Abstract = {{In many countries, authority for maintaining records of land ownership
   lies with national or state institutes, called `cadastres' or `land
   registries'. The emergence of volunteered geographic information (VGI)
   and crowdsourcing potentially challenges this state based authority,
   enabling the construction of `neo'-cadastres (using the analogy of
   `neo'geography). Individual citizens can themselves map and record land
   tenure rights. This paper explores if and how VGI and crowdsourcing may
   redefine the state based cadastres and land registries, and the roles of
   land users who claim land rights outside of the state based
   institutions. Using theories of institutions and isomorphism we
   hypothesise that a parallel exists between emerging open systems and
   situations where no state-based cadastre exists: participants in both
   situations will position themselves to protect their interests. Three
   cases from Ghana, Canada, and Indonesia demonstrate how land users
   indicate their land tenure right boundaries based on personal views (the
   neo-cadastre), rather than on rules stipulated by a national authority
   (the traditional cadastre). In each case land users root their behaviour
   partly in local dependency relations and social advocacy networks. These
   locally embedded rules may not necessarily coincide with hierarchical
   institutional relations. Even in participatory adjudication activities
   conducted under the authority of national cadastres, land users are not
   completely free in providing their land boundaries. Instead, they adhere
   to certain locally embedded microsocial conventions. We conclude that
   VGI and crowdsourced based neo-cadastres will likely redefine, from
   passive to active, the roles of land users in cadastres. This creates an
   opportunity for citizens, but also a potential risk. Where implicit
   rules of the neo-cadastre do not co-evolve with traditional cadastral
   institutions, conflicts of land information and access to land may
   emerge. Neo-cadastres will be an artefact of this dissatisfaction, and
   may reflect new directions for cadastral institutions. Neo-cadastres
   will not be a direct trigger for wider cadastral change, but a piece of
   evidence that change and resistance are occurring.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, social media emerged as a potential resource to improve
   the management of crisis situations such as disasters triggered by
   natural hazards. Although there is a growing research body concerned
   with the analysis of the usage of social media during disasters, most
   previous work has concentrated on using social media as a stand-alone
   information source, whereas its combination with other information
   sources holds a still underexplored potential. This article presents an
   approach to enhance the identification of relevant messages from social
   media that relies upon the relations between georeferenced social media
   messages as Volunteered Geographic Information and geographic features
   of flood phenomena as derived from authoritative data (sensor data,
   hydrological data and digital elevation models). We apply this approach
   to examine the micro-blogging text messages of the Twitter platform
   (tweets) produced during the River Elbe Flood of June 2013 in Germany.
   This is performed by means of a statistical analysis aimed at
   identifying general spatial patterns in the occurrence of flood-related
   tweets that may be associated with proximity to and severity of flood
   events. The results show that messages near (up to 10km) to severely
   flooded areas have a much higher probability of being related to floods.
   In this manner, we conclude that the geographic approach proposed here
   provides a reliable quantitative indicator of the usefulness of messages
   from social media by leveraging the existing knowledge about natural
   hazards such as floods, thus being valuable for disaster management in
   both crisis response and preventive monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{Binaries, the most reductive form of categorization, can be usefully
   invoked to characterize emerging phenomena; yet, they are widely

   content analysis this article traces the emergence of volunteered
   geographic information (VGI), and identifies the recurrent use of
   several related binaries to contrast this phenomenon with the

   deconstructed by identifying a mismatch in how VGI is conceptualized

   existing VGI projects. As an alternative to a binary conceptualization
   of spatial data production, a different representation is put forward
   that more accurately depicts what is in actuality a vast, shifting, and
   heterogeneous landscape of spatial data production approaches. Thinking
   about contemporary spatial data production not as a binary but as a

Abstract = {{OpenStreetMap (OSM), an open source mapping platform aiming to provide a
   free world map by registered users, has often been recognized as one of
   the prime examples of volunteered geographic information (VGI)
   construction. This is reflective of the recent exponential growth of
   user-generated geographic data facilitated by Web 2.0 technologies and
   location-aware devices. Notable efforts have been taken to investigate
   OSM developments and associated socio-political implications. However,
   still little is known about those less active contributors who
   constitute the majority of the contributors or long tail contributors in
   OSM and many other VGI initiatives. I therefore present an account of
   the dynamics of OSM mapping practices including these long tail
   contributors. Based on this investigation, I argue for a broader
   conceptualization of interactivity in VGI mappings, one that moves
   beyond a narrow focus on the mapping interface regarding the encounters
   between these VGI contributors and VGI initiatives. I suggest that this
   is helpful to better capture these dynamic and heterogeneous mapping
   practices constituting the data and representation in OSM, which in turn
   may have wider implications for everyday mapping and knowledge
   production.
   Les secrets de la conception d'OpenStreetMap : un court bilan Resume
   OpenStreetMap (OSM) est une plate-forme de cartographie en acces libre
   visant a fournir aux utilisateurs enregistres une carte du monde
   gratuite que l'on cite souvent comme l'un des exemples les plus
   apparents du chantier de l'information geographique volontaire (IGV).
   Celui-ci est le reflet de la recente croissance fulgurante des donnees
   geographiques generees par les utilisateurs qui est soutenue par les
   technologies Web 2.0 et les dispositifs de geolocalisation. Des travaux
   d'envergure ont ete entrepris pour enqueter sur l'evolution d'OSM et les
   consequences sociopolitiques qui en decoulent. Toutefois, on en sait
   encore peu sur les contributeurs moins actifs qui constituent la
   majorite, c'est-a-dire les contributeurs occasionnels d'OSM et de
   nombreuses autres initiatives d'IGV. Je brosse donc un tableau de la
   dynamique qui caracterise les pratiques de cartographie d'OSM en tenant
   compte des collaborateurs occasionnels. En tirant parti des resultats de
   cette enquete, je soutiens l'idee d'une conceptualisation elargie de
   l'<< interactivite >> dans les cartographies d'IGV qui depasse la vision
   etriquee de l'interface de cartographie servant de points de contact
   entre ces contributeurs et les initiatives d'IGV. J'en conclus que ceci
   peut contribuer a mieux cerner ces pratiques de cartographie dynamiques
   et heterogenes sur lesquelles se fondent les donnees et la
   representation d'OSM, ce qui pourrait ainsi entrainer des consequences
   de plus grande ampleur sur la cartographie au quotidien et la production

Abstract = {{Control data are critical for improving areal interpolation results.
   Remotely sensed imagery, road network, and parcels are the three most

   Meanwhile, the open access geographic data generated by social networks

   other purpose of this study is to test the effect of age bias control
   data on estimation of different age group populations. Results suggest
   that geo-located tweets as single control data does not perform as well
   as the three other control layers for total population and all
   age-specific population groups. However, the noticeable enhancement
   effect of Twitter data on other control data, especially for age groups

   better reflect population distribution by increasing variation in
   densities within a residential area delineated by other control data.

Abstract = {{Until recently, land surveys and digital interpretation of remotely
   sensed imagery have been used to generate land use inventories. These
   techniques however, are often cumbersome and costly, allocating large
   amounts of technical and temporal costs. The technological advances of
   web 2.0 have brought a wide array of technological achievements,
   stimulating the participatory role in collaborative and crowd sourced
   mapping products. This has been fostered by GPS-enabled devices, and
   accessible tools that enable visual interpretation of high resolution
   satellite images/air photos provided in collaborative mapping projects.
   Such technologies offer an integrative approach to geography by means of
   promoting public participation and allowing accurate assessment and
   classification of land use as well as geographical features.
   OpenStreetMap (OSM) has supported the evolution of such techniques,
   contributing to the existence of a large inventory of spatial land use
   information. This paper explores the introduction of this novel
   participatory phenomenon for land use classification in Europe's
   metropolitan regions. We adopt a positivistic approach to assess
   comparatively the accuracy of these contributions of OSM for land use
   classifications in seven large European metropolitan regions. Thematic
   accuracy and degree of completeness of OSM data was compared to
   available Global Monitoring for Environment and Security Urban Atlas
   (GMESUA) datasets for the chosen metropolises. We further extend our
   findings of land use within a novel framework for geography, justifying
   that volunteered geographic information (VGI) sources are of great
   benefit for land use mapping depending on location and degree of VGI
   dynamism and offer a great alternative to traditional mapping techniques
   for metropolitan regions throughout Europe. Evaluation of several land
   use types at the local level suggests that a number of OSM classes (such
   as anthropogenic land use, agricultural and some natural environment
   classes) are viable alternatives for land use classification. These
   classes are highly accurate and can be integrated into planning
   decisions for stakeholders and policymakers. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

   models that are used for many applications. This study combines the
   advantages of both ALS and OSM, offering a promising new approach that
   enhances data quality and allows change detection: the mainly up-to-date
   2D data of OSM can be combined with the high-resolution-but rarely
   updated-elevation information provided by ALS. This case study
   investigates building objects of OSM and ALS data of the city of
   Bregenz, Austria. Data quality of OSM is discerned by the comparison of
   building footprints using different true positive definitions (e. g.
   overlapping area). High quality of OSM data is revealed, yet also
   limitations of each method with respect to heterogeneous regions and
   building outlines are identified. For the first time, an up-to-date
   Digital Surface Model (DSM) combining 2D OSM and ALS data is achieved. A
   multitude of applications such as flood simulations and solar potential

   communicating landscape changes}},
Journal = {{LAND USE POLICY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{43}},
Pages = {{82-95}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{This paper reports on a potential new form of data generation and data
   display to be used for communicating landscape change at local scales,
   utilizing a huge collection of oblique aerial photographs held by the
   Royal Library in Copenhagen. The collection contains local scale imagery
   covering all parts of Denmark recorded between 1930 and 1990 and thus
   has the potential to illustrate the changes which took place in the
   rural landscape as a whole after the Second World War, in ways which are
   suited for use at local scales. Taking into account that landscape
   change normally happens at a slow rate relative to the perceptive scale
   of humans, with fine grained changes taking place continuously in local
   settings, images of this kind present themselves as a way for the
   general public to become aware of changes which might otherwise be
   overlooked. To a still more urbanized population where most people do
   not have an every-day experience with rural landscape change, the images
   may be a starting point for a renewed engagement with landscapes, not
   just perceived as a scenery, but rather as a process of interaction with
   the environment. In order to inform a wider range of people, in
   competition with other types of information, the imagery provides a
   point of reference - a single farm or landscape known to the users which
   people without specific training in landscape research can relate to.
   The use of a crowdsourcing approach in data generation on a webgis
   application means that the broader public is both involved in the
   creation of the data and in the discussion about the changes observed,
   which become visible when comparing old aerial photographs to the
   present landscape. In combination with the very local nature of the
   aerial photographs, this opens up the possibility that the images could
   serve as a communicational bridge between ``abstract{''} scientific
   knowledge about landscape change (e.g. change in hedgerow density per
   year) and the local landscapes where people are living. As such, the
   approach described in this paper may contribute to the objectives set
   out in the European landscape convention to facilitate an increased
   understanding of landscape issues among the public through a democratic
   learning process. The article concludes, that this approach has a huge
   potential, although some difficulties exist, relating to the challenge
   of maintaining a focus on the landscape when using a form of
   communication which is dialogue-based and relatively unstructured
   compared to approaches embedded within conventional learning
   environments. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   OpenStreetMap (OSM) indicate the success of this VGI-based project in
   attracting diverse sets of people from all over the world. A huge amount

   faces the challenge of ensuring data quality. Spatial data quality
   comprises several basic elements; among them, logical consistency
   concerns the existence of logical contradictions within a dataset. It is
   one of the most important elements, but has not been studied much in VGI
   despite the key role in quality assurance. Because of the participatory
   nature of data collection and entry in OSM, the common consistency
   checking routines for spatial data should be revised. Since contributors
   have different views about objects, data integration in OSM may be
   considered as a form of multi-representation data combination. In this
   article, the concept of spatial similarity in multi-representation
   considering three elements, i.e. directional relationships, topological
   relationships, and metric distance relationships, is used to build a

Abstract = {{Land use (LU) maps are an important source of information in academia
   and for policy-makers describing the usage of land parcels. A large
   amount of effort and monetary resources are spent on mapping LU features
   over time and at local, regional, and global scales. Remote sensing
   images and signal processing techniques, as well as land surveying are
   the prime sources to map LU features. However, both data gathering
   approaches are financially expensive and time consuming. But recently,
   Web 2.0 technologies and the wide dissemination of GPSenabled devices
   boosted public participation in collaborative mapping projects (CMPs).
   In this regard, the OpenStreetMap (OSM) project has been one of the most
   successful representatives, providing LU features. The main objective of
   this paper is to comparatively assess the accuracy of the contributed
   OSM-LU features in four German metropolitan areas versus the
   pan-European GMESUA dataset as a reference. Kappa index analysis along
   with per-class user's and producers' accuracies are used for accuracy
   assessment. The empirical findings suggest OSM as an alternative
   complementary source for extracting LU information whereas exceeding 50
   \% of the selected cities are mapped by mappers. Moreover, the results
   identify which land types preserve high/moderate/low accuracy across
   cities for urban LU mapping. The findings strength the potential of
   collaboratively collected LU features for providing temporal LU maps as
   well as updating/enriching existing inventories. Furthermore, such a
   collaborative approach can be used for collecting a global coverage of
   LU information specifically in countries in which temporal and monetary
   efforts could be minimized.}},

Abstract = {{Studies have analyzed the quality of volunteered geographic information
   (VGI) datasets, assessing the positional accuracy of features and the
   semantic accuracy of the attributes. While it has been shown that VGI
   can, in some contexts, reach a high positional accuracy, these studies
   have also highlighted a large spatial heterogeneity in positional
   accuracy and completeness, but also concerning the semantics of the
   objects. Such high semantic heterogeneity of VGI datasets becomes a
   significant obstacle to a number of possible uses that could be made of
   the data. This paper proposes an approach for both improving the
   semantic quality and reducing the semantic heterogeneity of VGI
   datasets. The improvement of the semantic quality is achieved by using a
   tag recommender system, called OSMantic, which automatically suggests
   relevant tags to contributors during the editing process. Such an
   approach helps contributors find the most appropriate tags for a given
   object, hence reducing the overall dataset semantic heterogeneity. The
   approach was implemented into a plugin for the Java OpenStreetMap editor
   (JOSM) and different examples illustrate how this plugin can be used to
   improve the quality of VGI data. This plugin has been tested by OSM
   contributors and evaluated using an online questionnaire. Results of the
   evaluation suggest a high level of satisfaction from users and are

Abstract = {{Critical cartographic scholarship has demonstrated that maps (and
   geoinformation in general) can never be neutral or objective: maps are
   always embedded in specific social contexts of production and use and
   thus unavoidably reproduce social conventions and hierarchies.
   Furthermore, it has been argued that maps also (re) produce certain
   geographies and thus social realities. This argument shifts attention to
   the constitutive effects of maps and the ways in which they make the
   world. Within the discussion on neogeography and volunteered geographic
   information, it has been argued that crowd sourcing offers a radical
   alternative to conventional ways of map making, challenging the hegemony
   of official and commercial cartographies. In this view, crowd-sourced
   Web 2.0-mapping projects such as OpenStreetMap (OSM) might begin to
   offer a forum for different voices, mapping new things, enabling new
   ways of living. In our contribution, we frame a research agenda that
   draws upon critical cartography but widens the scope of analysis to the
   assemblages of practices, actors, technologies, and norms at work: an
   agenda which is inspired by the ``critical GIS{''}-literature, to take
   the specific social contexts and effects of technologies into account,
   but which deploys a processual view of mapping. We recognize that a
   fundamental transition in mapping is taking place, and that OSM may well
   be of central importance in this process. However, we stress that social
   conventions, political hegemonies, unequal economic and technical
   resources etc. do not fade away with crowdsourced Web 2.0 projects, but
   rather transform themselves and impact upon mapping practices. Together
   these examples suggest that research into OSM might usefully reflect
   more critically on the contexts in which new geographic knowledge is
   being assembled.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to address changes in public communication
   following the advent of Internet social networking tools and the
   emerging web 2.0 technologies which are providing new ways of sharing
   information and knowledge. In particular public administrations are
   called upon to reinvent the governance of public affairs and to update
   the means for interacting with their communities. The paper develops an
   analysis of the distribution, diffusion and performance of the official
   profiles on Twitter adopted by the Italian municipalities (comuni) up to
   November 2013. It aims to identify the patterns of spatial distribution
   and the drivers of the diffusion of Twitter profiles; the performance of
   the profiles through an aggregated index, called the Twitter performance
   index (Twiperindex), which evaluates the profiles' activity with
   reference to the gravitational areas of the municipalities in order to
   enable comparisons of the activity of municipalities with different
   demographic sizes and functional roles. The results show that only a
   small portion of innovative municipalities have adopted Twitter to
   enhance e-participation and e-governance and that the drivers of the
   diffusion seem to be related either to past experiences and existing
   conditions (i.e. civic networks, digital infrastructures) developed over
   time or to strong local community awareness. The better performances are
   achieved mainly by small and medium-sized municipalities. Of course, the
   phenomenon is very new and fluid, therefore this analysis should be
   considered as a first step in ongoing research which aims to grasp the
   dynamics of these new means of public communication.}},

Abstract = {{We discuss an OpenStreetMap (OSM) mapping party organised during the
   Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial (FOSS4G) Europe 2015
   conference held in Como, Italy in July 2015. While primarily the mapping
   party was organised as a conference social event, there was also the
   serious goal of collecting and adding geographic data to the OSM
   database of Como city. Our paper describes the organisation, planning
   and structure of the mapping party. Results show that considerable
   amounts of data was collected and uploaded to OSM. Overall there was
   very good interest in the mapping party with 40 participants. While the
   majority of participants were delegates at the conference and
   consequently could be considered highly skilled GIS practitioners only a
   very small number had actually contributed data to OSM in the past. We
   discuss the key lessons learned and overall positive and negative
   aspects of this mapping party.}},

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{2495}},
Pages = {{101-111}},
Abstract = {{Finding a scenic route between two locations is a common trip-planning
   task, in particular for tourists and recreational travelers. For the
   automated computation of a scenic route in a trip-planning system to
   function, it is necessary to understand which attributes of a route and
   its surroundings are associated with attractive scenery. One way to find
   this information is with a route choice model framework, which requires
   a choice set of realistic paths for traveling a scenic route. This paper
   proposes a constrained enumeration type algorithm for computing scenic
   alternatives with a branch-and-bound approach and a labeling algorithm
   in combination with link elimination to generate a scenic route choice
   set. These algorithms use volunteered geographic information shared,
   geotagged photos (photos to which geographical identification metadata
   have been added) from Panoramio-to generate path alternatives. The
   results show that the proposed branch-and-bound algorithm replicated
   observe travel behavior better than the traditional deterministic
   minimum cost based algorithms in terms of overlap and consistency. In
   addition, for the proposed branch-and-bound method, the average number
   of scenic clusters was almost identical to that found along observed
   scenic routes; this method outperformed all other evaluated algorithms
   for this aspect.}},

   foundational drivers, which are: the recognition of the value of vulgar
   local knowledge, and the acceleration of cyberspace communication
   capacities. Section 2 analyses VGI modalities and systems in terms of
   their characteristics and practices, in a frame of good governance
   principles and participatory process. In Section 3 this analytical
   framework is used in evaluating two specific cases in terms of
   governance and participation principles and practice. The paper

   surveillance. Current advances in these geospatial technologies enable
   geographers both professional and citizen geographers to contribute,

   There are a number of challenges to incorporating collaborative tools in
   spatial decision-making e.g., a lack of interoperability with other
   tools commonly used by organizations, and a lack of generality to enable
   sustainable processes within a group accomplishing a specific task. A
   Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) presents a possible solution to these

   two main strategies for network matching: segment-based and node-based
   matching. The comparison shows that the result quality is comparable for
   the two strategies, but the node-based result is considerably more
   computationally efficient. Therefore, we improve the accuracy of

   patterns of complicated network components. Finally, we conduct a case
   study on the extended node-based algorithm in which we match OSM to the

Journal = {{NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1985-1997}},
Abstract = {{Recreational activities in snow-covered mountainous terrain in the
   backcountry account for the vast majority of avalanche accidents.
   Studies analyzing avalanche risk mostly rely on accident statistics
   without considering exposure (or the elements at risk), i. e., how many,
   when and where people are recreating, as data on recreational activity
   in the winter mountains are scarce. To fill this gap, we explored
   volunteered geographic information on two social media mountaineering
   websites-bergportal.ch and camptocamp.org. Based on these data, we
   present a spatiotemporal pattern of winter backcountry touring activity
   in the Swiss Alps and compare this with accident statistics.
   Geographically, activity was concentrated in Alpine regions relatively
   close to the main Swiss population centers in the west and north. In
   contrast, accidents occurred equally often in the less-frequented
   inner-alpine regions. Weekends, weather and avalanche conditions
   influenced the number of recreationists, while the odds to be involved
   in a severe avalanche accident did not depend on weekends or weather
   conditions. However, the likelihood of being involved in an accident
   increased with increasing avalanche danger level, but also with a more
   unfavorable snowpack containing persistent weak layers (also referred to
   as an old snow problem). In fact, the most critical situation for
   backcountry recreationists and professionals occurred on days and in
   regions when both the avalanche danger was critical and when the
   snowpack contained persistent weak layers. The frequently occurring
   geographical pattern of a more unfavorable snowpack structure also
   explains the relatively high proportion of accidents in the
   less-frequented inner-alpine regions. These results have practical
   implications: avalanche forecasters should clearly communicate the
   avalanche danger and the avalanche problem to the backcountry user,
   particularly if persistent weak layers are of concern. Professionals and
   recreationists, on the other hand, require the expertise to adjust the
   planning of a tour and their backcountry travel behavior depending on
   the avalanche danger and the avalanche problem.}},

Abstract = {{The type of data an individual contributor adds to OpenStreetMap (OSM)
   varies by region. The local knowledge of a data contributor allows for
   the collection and editing of detailed features such as small trails,
   park benches or fire hydrants, as well as adding attribute information
   that can only be accessed locally. As opposed to this, satellite imagery
   that is provided as background images in OSM data editors, such as ID,
   Potlatch or JOSM, facilitates the contribution of less detailed data
   through on-screen digitizing, oftentimes for areas the contributor is
   less familiar with. Knowing whether an area is part of a contributor's
   home region or not can therefore be a useful predictor of OSM data
   quality for a geographic region. This research explores the editing
   history of nodes and ways for 13 highly active OSM members within a
   two-tiered clustering process to delineate an individual mapper's home
   region from remotely mapped areas. The findings are evaluated against
   those found with a previously introduced method which determines a
   contributor's home region solely based on spatial clustering of created
   nodes. The comparison shows that both methods are able to delineate
   similar home regions for the 13 contributors with some differences.}},

Abstract = {{Volunteered geographic information (VGI) is geographic information
   collected by way of crowdsourcing. However, the distinction between VGI
   as an information product and the processes that create VGI is blurred.
   Clearly, the environment that influences the creation of VGI is
   different than the information product itself, yet most literature
   treats them as one and the same. Thus, this research is motivated by the
   need to formalize and standardize the systems that support the creation
   of VGI. To this end, we propose a conceptual framework for VGI systems,
   the main components of which-project, participants, and technical
   infrastructure-form an environment conducive to the creation of VGI.
   Drawing on examples from OpenStreetMap, Ushahidi, and RinkWatch, we
   illustrate the pragmatic relevance of these components. Applying a
   system perspective to VGI allows us to better understand the components
   and functionality needed to effectively create VGI.}},

Abstract = {{Crowdsourcing is not a new practice but it is a concept that has gained
   substantial attention during recent disasters. Drawing from previous
   work in the crisis informatics, disaster sociology, and
   computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) literature, this paper first
   explains recent conceptualizations of crowdsourcing and how
   crowdsourcing is a way of leveraging disaster convergence. The CSCW
   concept of ``articulation work{''} is introduced as an interpretive
   frame for extracting the salient dimensions of ``crisis
   crowdsourcing.{''} Then, a series of vignettes are presented to
   illustrate the evolution of crisis crowdsourcing that spontaneously
   emerged after the 2010 Haiti earthquake and evolved to more established
   forms of public engagement during crises. The best practices extracted
   from the vignettes clarified the efforts to formalize crisis
   crowdsourcing through the development of innovative interfaces designed
   to support the articulation work needed to facilitate spontaneous
   volunteer efforts. Extracting these best practices led to the
   development of a conceptual framework that unpacks the key dimensions of
   crisis crowdsourcing. The Crisis Crowdsourcing Framework is a
   systematic, problem-driven approach to determining the why, who, what,
   when, where, and how aspects of a crowdsourcing system. The framework
   also draws attention to the social, technological, organizational, and
   policy (STOP) interfaces that need to be designed to manage the
   articulation work involved with reducing the complexity of coordinating
   across these key dimensions. An example of how to apply the framework to
   design a crowdsourcing system is offered with a discussion on the
   implications for applying this framework as well as the limitations of
   this framework. Innovation is occurring at the social, technological,
   organizational, and policy interfaces enabling crowdsourcing to be
   operationalized and integrated into official products and services.}},

Abstract = {{There has been greater tendency towards embracing the potential of the
   Web 2.0 in knowledge creation with user contributions becoming
   significantly important in the development of open data such as
   Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI). An increasing number of
   volunteers which add value to geospatial data require effective ways of
   organising and providing access to value-added or newly created data.
   Metadata records are often unavailable for VGI, making it problematic
   for users to discover data in the VGI system. This paper discusses
   potential approaches that can be used to create metadata for VGI. This
   includes Linked Data, professionally created metadata and metadata
   created by volunteers. The paper then discusses the shortcomings of
   these approaches and proposes an unconventional alternative, Geospatial
   Metadata 2.0. This approach involves VGI users in the creation of
   metadata, and builds on folksonomies created by them. The paper presents
   the design and implementation of this idea in a prototype system along
   with an assessment result. The implementation includes Geospatial
   Metadata 2.0 add-ons in Geonetwork, and the assessment benefits from the
   input of metadata experts worldwide. The assessment of the benefits
   results indicate such an approach of metadata creation is promising and
   has the potential to be employed in VGI systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

   As the role of information and communications technologies (ICTs) grows,
   governments have seen the Geoweb and Web 2.0 as an opportunity to
   increase citizen involvement through e-government which provides

   represent citizens' most direct contact with local governments in the
   form of volunteered geographic information (VGI) empowering citizens
   with the means of solving community issues. Past studies have examined
   VGI and e-government use finding patterns of a digital divide with

   these patterns using citizen-generated data is needed to understand the
   link between users and the content they create. This paper seeks to
   explore the relationship between sociodemographic status and 311 service
   request frequency in three cities within the United States using

   needs to be known. However, roof material information is not readily
   available in the Canadian public domain. To overcome this challenge, a
   unique Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) application was
   developed using Google Street View that engages citizens to classify the
   roof materials of single dwelling residences in a simple and intuitive

Abstract = {{It has been argued that crowd-sourcing offers a radical alternative to
   conventional ways of mapping, challenging the hegemony of official and
   commercial cartographies. In this view mapping might begin to offer a
   forum for different voices, mapping different things, enabling new ways
   of living. Instead of the Latourian notion of the map as immutable
   mobile, fixing knowledge and bodies and facilitating governance, the
   wikification of mapping might facilitate a more mutable politics. This
   paper focuses on these possibilities by examining OpenStreetMap (OSM),
   arguably the most significant and emancipatory of neo-geographic
   assemblages. While not underplaying the importance of a political
   economic understanding of the Geoweb, it suggests we need to attend more
   to the contexts through which emergent knowledge communities enact
   alternatives, and that notions of practice are central in any evaluation
   of changing politics of representation. Communities involved in OSM
   contest the geographies that they call into being, and this process can
   be narrated through a consideration of local action, in different map
   spaces and places. A processual view of mapping reveals the extent of
   mutability of OSM, and highlights many of the tensions evident in
   collaborative remapping. New ways of mapping reciprocally create and
   reinforce newly expert knowledge communities that may be emancipatory,
   but that may also reify power relations. Crowd-sourced mapping is likely
   to comprise a hybrid of mutable and immutable elements.}},

Title = {{Mapping the data shadows of Hurricane Sandy: Uncovering the sociospatial
   dimensions of `big data'}},
Journal = {{GEOFORUM}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{52}},
Pages = {{167-179}},

Abstract = {{Digital social data are now practically ubiquitous, with increasingly
   large and interconnected databases leading researchers, politicians, and
   the private sector to focus on how such `big data' can allow potentially
   unprecedented insights into our world. This paper investigates Twitter
   activity in the wake of Hurricane Sandy in order to demonstrate the
   complex relationship between the material world and its digital
   representations. Through documenting the various spatial patterns of
   Sandy-related tweeting both within the New York metropolitan region and
   across the United States, we make a series of broader conceptual and
   methodological interventions into the nascent geographic literature on
   big data. Rather than focus on how these massive databases are causing
   necessary and irreversible shifts in the ways that knowledge is
   produced, we instead find it more productive to ask how small subsets of
   big data, especially georeferenced social media information scraped from
   the internet, can reveal the geographies of a range of social processes
   and practices. Utilizing both qualitative and quantitative methods, we
   can uncover broad spatial patterns within this data, as well as
   understand how this data reflects the lived experiences of the people
   creating it. We also seek to fill a conceptual lacuna in studies of
   user-generated geographic information, which have often avoided any
   explicit theorizing of sociospatial relations, by employing Jessop et
   al.'s TPSN framework. Through these interventions, we demonstrate that
   any analysis of user-generated geographic information must take into
   account the existence of more complex spatialities than the relatively
   simple spatial ontology implied by latitude and longitude coordinates.

Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},

Volume = {{258}},
Pages = {{312-327}},
Month = {{FEB 10}},
Abstract = {{The paper analyses the challenges and problems posed by the use of
   Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) in citizen science and a
   proposal is formulated for assessing VGI quality based on a linguistic
   decision making approach so as to allow its feasible use for scientific
   purposes.
   VGI quality is represented by indicators at distinct levels of
   granularity which take into account the distinct components of the VGI
   items. The quality indicators represent both the extrinsic quality,
   depending on the characteristics and reputation of the sources of
   information; the intrinsic quality, depending on the distinct accuracy
   and precision of information; and, last but not least, the pragmatic
   quality, depending on the user needs and intended purposes. In order to
   assess the pragmatic quality of VGI items, a linguistic decision making
   approach is defined that allows users to rank and finally filter the VGI
   items based on the satisfaction of distinct criteria expressed by means
   of both linguistic terms, defining soft constraints on the distinct
   quality indicators, and linguistic aggregators, defining fuzzy operators
   which combine the satisfaction degrees of the soft constraints at
   distinct hierarchical levels to yield the final satisfaction of the VGI
   items. Finally, an example of quality assessment in a glaciological
   citizen science project is discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Natural disasters like floods are a worldwide phenomenon and a serious
   threat to mankind. Flood simulations are applications of disaster
   control, which are used for the development of appropriate flood
   protection. Adequate simulations require not only the geometry but also
   the roughness of the Earth's surface, as well as the roughness of the
   objects hereon. Usually, the floodplain roughness is based on land
   use/land cover maps derived from orthophotos. This study analyses the
   applicability of roughness map derivation approaches for flood
   simulations based on different datasets: orthophotos, LiDAR data,
   official land use data, OpenStreetMap data and CORINE Land Cover data.
   Object-based image analysis is applied to orthophotos and LiDAR raster
   data in order to generate land cover maps, which enable a roughness
   parameterization. The vertical vegetation structure within the LiDAR
   point cloud is used to derive an additional floodplain roughness map.
   Further roughness maps are derived from official land use data,
   OpenStreetMap and CORINE Land Cover datasets. Six different flood
   simulations are applied based on one elevation data but with the
   different roughness maps. The results of the hydrodynamic- numerical
   models include information on flow velocity and water depth from which
   the additional attribute flood intensity is calculated of. The results
   based on roughness maps derived from LiDAR data and OpenStreetMap data
   are comparable, whereas the results of the other datasets differ
   significantly.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED GEOGRAPHY}},

Volume = {{47}},
Pages = {{70-77}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The generation of a routing network for disabled people inherits a
   number of prerequisites that need special consideration. Widespread
   routing applications that rely on commercial or governmental geodata
   sources are not feasible for this specific task, due to the lack of
   detailed information about features such as sidewalks, surface
   conditions or road incline. In recent years the research community has
   experienced a strong increase in studies related to routing applications
   tailored to disabled people in which the lack of a sophisticated dataset
   played a major role. This study proposes an algorithm for the generation
   of a disabled people friendly routing network, based on collaboratively
   collected geodata provided by the OpenStreetMap (OSM) project. This new
   representation of a routing graph can be used in numerous applications
   and maps dedicated to people with disabilities. The algorithm is tested
   and evaluated for selected areas in Europe, resulting in newly generated
   extended networks that include sidewalk information. The results have
   shown that the success of the final implementation of the introduced
   algorithm depends highly on the attribute quality of the OSM dataset.

Abstract = {{The term neogeography, which designates the proliferation of Web-based
   geographic information technologies and the parallel opening up of the
   mapping enterprise to nonexpert cartographers, gained traction in 2006.
   Implicit in the declaration of neogeography, however, is a
   trivialization of the geographic discipline. Academic geographers, who
   have never expressed affinity for the label neogeography, have worked to
   problematize the instrumentalist reductionism of the discipline to data
   and technics that such a branding presupposes. But as Wilson and Graham
   (2013b) recently argued, neogeographyor neo, geographyis as much a
   statement about newness as it is a commentary about the discipline.
   Geographers' emphasis on the geography part of the neo, geography
   equation, although warranted, has come at the expense of examining the
   equally important societal implications of the framing of recent spatial
   information technologies as always-already new. In this article, I
   foreground the neo in neo, geography and trace the ways in which the
   ascribed newness of emergent Web-based spatial media is leveraged in
   discursive-material practices that enact certain kinds of changes in the
   world. Drawing on illustrative empirical examples, I demonstrate the
   ways in which newness (1) acts as a discursive device that depoliticizes
   spatial media so as to lay the groundwork for their social
   naturalization; (2) is made recourse to as a means by which certain
   techno-capitalist actors disavow themselves of responsibility for the
   societal effects of these technologies; and (3) underwrites the model
   through which the proliferation and thereby profitability of
   location-based services is sustained.}},

Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Integrating heterogeneous spatial data is a crucial problem for
   geographical information systems (GIS) applications. Previous studies
   mainly focus on the matching of heterogeneous road networks or
   heterogeneous polygonal data sets. Few literatures attempt to approach
   the problem of integrating the point of interest (POI) from volunteered
   geographic information (VGI) and professional road networks from
   official mapping agencies. Hence, the article proposes an approach for
   integrating VGI POIs and professional road networks. The proposed method
   first generates a POI connectivity graph by mining the linear cluster
   patterns from POIs. Secondly, the matching nodes between the POI
   connectivity graph and the associated road network are fulfilled by
   probabilistic relaxation and refined by a vector median filtering (VMF).
   Finally, POIs are aligned to the road network by an affine
   transformation according to the matching nodes. Experiments demonstrate
   that the proposed method integrates both the POIs from VGI and the POIs
   from official mapping agencies with the associated road networks
   effectively and validly, providing a promising solution for enriching
   professional road networks by integrating VGI POIs.}},

Abstract = {{Geographies of codified knowledge have always been characterized by
   stark core-periphery patterns, with some parts of the world at the
   center of global voice and representation and many others invisible or
   unheard. Many have pointed to the potential for radical change, however,
   as digital divides are bridged and 2.5 billion people are now online.
   With a focus on Wikipedia, which is one of the world's most visible,
   most used, and most powerful repositories of user-generated content, we
   investigate whether we are now seeing fundamentally different patterns
   of knowledge production. Even though Wikipedia consists of a massive
   cloud of geographic information about millions of events and places
   around the globe put together by millions of hours of human labor, the
   encyclopedia remains characterized by uneven and clustered geographies:
   There is simply not a lot of content about much of the world. The
   article then moves to describe the factors that explain these patterns,
   showing that although just a few conditions can explain much of the
   variance in geographies of information, some parts of the world remain
   well below their expected values. These findings indicate that better
   connectivity is only a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the
   presence of volunteered geographic information about a place. We
   conclude by discussing the remaining social, economic, political,
   regulatory, and infrastructural barriers that continue to disadvantage
   many of the world's informational peripheries. The article ultimately
   shows that, despite many hopes that a democratization of connectivity
   will spur a concomitant democratization of information production,
   Internet connectivity is not a panacea and can only ever be one part of
   a broader strategy to deepen the informational layers of places.}},

Abstract = {{Arguably, there have been few shifts in the GISciences so paradigmatic

   in the US have witnessed these changes in just the last crop of PhD
   students, with topics on location-based services, the geoweb,

   earlier, trendy topics on web-based GIS and interactive digital
   cartography. Indeed, there are new important players in GISc, with
   training in and outside of Geography, with backgrounds as diverse as the
   engineering/computational sciences and the digital humanities as well as
   critical human geographies. Mobilities researchers, qualitative GIS
   scholars, cyberinfrastructural scientists, and social and cultural
   geographers have configured research programs around the proliferation
   of locationally-aware devices and the `big data' that have emerged from

Abstract = {{Collective intelligence is the idea that under the right circumstances
   collections of individuals are smarter than even the smartest
   individuals in the group, that is a group has an ``intelligence{''} that
   is independent of the intelligence of its members. The ideology of
   collective intelligence undergirds much of the enthusiasm about the use
   of ``volunteered{''} or crowd-sourced geographic information. Literature
   from a variety of fields makes clear that not all groups possess
   collective intelligence, this article identifies four pre-conditions for
   the emergence of collective intelligence and then examines the extent to
   which collectively generated mapping systems satisfy these conditions.
   However, the ``intelligence{''} collectively generated maps is hard to
   assess because there are two difficult to reconcile perspectives on map
   quality - the credibility perspective and the accuracy perspective. Much
   of the current literature on user-generated maps focuses on assessing
   the quality of individual contributions. However, because user-generated
   maps are complex social systems and because the quality of a
   contribution is difficult to assess this strategy may not yield an
   ``intelligent{''} end product. The existing literature on collective
   intelligence suggests that the structure of groups is more important
   than the intelligence of group members. Applying this idea to
   user-generated maps suggests that systems should be designed to foster
   conditions known to produce collective intelligence rather than
   privileging particular contributions/contributors. The article concludes
   with some design recommendations and by considering the implications of
   collectively generated maps for both expert knowledge and traditional
   state sponsored mapping programs.}},

Abstract = {{To a large degree, the attraction of Big Data lies in the variety of its
   heterogeneous multi-thematic and multi-dimensional data sources and not
   merely its volume. To fully exploit this variety, however, requires
   conflation. This is a two-step process. First, one has to establish
   identity relations between information entities across different data
   sources; and second, attribute values have to be merged according to
   certain procedures that avoid logical contradictions. The first step,
   also called matching, can be thought of as a weighted combination of
   common attributes according to some similarity measures. In this work,
   we propose such a matching based on multiple attributes of Points of
   Interest (POI) from the Location-based Social Network Foursquare and the
   local directory service Yelp. While both contain overlapping attributes
   that can be used for matching, they have specific strengths and
   weaknesses that make their conflation desirable. For instance,
   Foursquare offers information about user check-ins to places, while Yelp
   specializes in user-contributed reviews. We present a weighted
   multi-attribute matching strategy, evaluate its performance, and discuss
   application areas that benefit from a successful matching. Finally, we
   also outline how the established POI matches can be stored as Linked
   Data on the Semantic Web. Our strategy can automatically match 97\% of
   randomly selected Yelp POI to their corresponding Foursquare entities.}},

Abstract = {{Data on population at building level is required for various purposes.
   However, to protect privacy, government population data is aggregated.
   Population estimates at finer scales can be obtained through areal
   interpolation, a process where data from a first spatial unit system is
   transferred to another system. Areal interpolation can be conducted with
   ancillary data that guide the redistribution of population. For
   population estimation at the building level, common ancillary data
   include three-dimensional data on buildings, obtained through costly
   processes such as LiDAR. Meanwhile, volunteered geographic information
   (VGI) is emerging as a new category of data and is already used for
   purposes related to urban management. The objective of this paper is to
   present an alternative approach for building level areal interpolation
   that uses VGI as ancillary data. The proposed method integrates existing
   interpolation techniques, i.e., multi-class dasymetric mapping and
   interpolation by surface volume integration; data on building footprints
   and points-of-interest (POIs) extracted from OpenStreetMap (OSM) are
   used to refine population estimates at building level. A case study was
   conducted for the city of Hamburg and the results were compared using
   different types of POIs. The results suggest that VGI can be used to
   accurately estimate population distribution, but that further research
   is needed to understand how POIs can reveal population distribution
   patterns.}},

Abstract = {{A large number of applications have been launched to gather geo-located
   information from the public. This article introduces an approach toward
   generating land-use patterns from volunteered geographic information
   (VGI) without applying remote-sensing techniques and/or engaging
   official data. Hence, collaboratively collected OpenStreetMap (OSM) data
   sets are employed to map land-use patterns in Vienna, Austria. Initially
   the spatial pattern of the landscape was delineated and thereafter the
   most relevant land type was assigned to each land parcel through a
   hierarchical GIS-based decision tree approach. To evaluate the proposed
   approach, the results are compared with the Global Monitoring for
   Environment and Security Urban Atlas (GMESUA) data. The results are
   compared in two ways: first, the texture of the resulting land-use
   patterns is analyzed using texture-variability analysis. Second, the
   attributes assigned to each land segment are evaluated. The achieved
   land-use map shows kappa indices of 91, 79, and 76\% agreement for
   location in comparison with the GMESUA data set at three levels of
   classification. Furthermore, the attributes of the two data sets match
   at 81, 67, and 65\%. The results demonstrate that this approach opens a
   promising avenue to integrate freely available VGI to map land-use
   patterns for environmental planning purposes.}},

Abstract = {{Due to financial or administrative constraints, access to official
   spatial base data is currently limited to a small subset of all
   potential users in the field of spatial planning and research. This
   increases the usefulness of Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI), in
   particular OpenStreetMap (OSM), as supplementary datasets or, in some
   cases, alternative sources of primary data. In contrast to the OSM
   street network, which has already been thoroughly investigated and found
   to be practically complete in many areas, the degree of completeness of
   OSM data on buildings is still unclear. In this paper we describe
   methods to analyze building completeness and apply these to various test
   areas in Germany. Official data from national mapping and cadastral
   agencies is used as a basis for comparison. The results show that
   unit-based completeness measurements (e.g., total number or area of
   buildings) are highly sensitive to disparities in modeling between
   official data and VGI. Therefore, we recommend object-based methods to
   study the completeness of OSM building footprint data. An analysis from
   November 2011 in Germany indicated a completeness of 25\% in the federal
   states of North Rhine-Westphalia and 15\% in Saxony. Although further
   analyses from 2012 confirm that data completeness in Saxony has risen to
   23\%, the rate of new data input was slowing in the year 2012.}},

Abstract = {{Volunteered geographic information (VGI), or geospatial crowdsourcing,
   is where citizens (volunteers) contribute data and information about the

   sustainable option for use as a source of spatial information for
   pervasive computing technologies, particularly in areas where access to

   gained the interest of the geoscience community, because of its ability

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{44}},
Pages = {{1-11}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The management of multiple-use public lands such as national forests in
   the U.S. is controversial because of the wide range of potential uses
   and contested public values for these lands. Previous research on
   national forest values and management preferences examined these
   relationships non-spatially. The development of public participation GIS
   (PPGIS) and volunteered geographic information (VGI) systems provide new
   opportunities to assess spatial relationships between perceived national
   forest values and preferred uses. This research used empirical data
   collected from a PPGIS/VGI study for three national forests in
   California to examine spatial and non-spatial relationships between
   place-based forest values and preferred uses. The relationships suggest
   public participants translated some of their non-spatial forest values
   and preferences into behavioral choices when mapping place-specific
   values and preferred uses. The empirical relationships between
   place-based forest values and uses were generally consistent with
   previous survey research results. Positive, non-spatial attitudes toward
   extractive uses of national forests were correlated with participant
   mapping of economic values and related extractive uses, while
   nonmaterial forest attitudes were correlated with participant mapping of
   amenity values and conservation-related uses. Further, spatial
   preferences for extractive forest uses such as timber harvesting were
   mapped proximate to economic values, while nonmaterial spatial
   preferences were mapped proximate to amenity-related forest values.
   PPGIS offers the potential to translate philosophical and ideology-based
   national forest preferences into place-specific discourse about forest
   management activities where public accommodation may be more achievable.

Abstract = {{In recent years, a web phenomenon known as Volunteered Geographic
   Information (VGI) has produced large crowdsourced geographic data sets.
   OpenStreetMap (OSM), the leading VGI project, aims at building an
   open-content world map through user contributions. OSM semantics
   consists of a set of properties (called `tags') describing geographic
   classes, whose usage is defined by project contributors on a dedicated
   Wiki website. Because of its simple and open semantic structure, the OSM
   approach often results in noisy and ambiguous data, limiting its
   usability for analysis in information retrieval, recommender systems and
   data mining. Devising a mechanism for computing the semantic similarity
   of the OSM geographic classes can help alleviate this semantic gap. The
   contribution of this paper is twofold. It consists of (1) the
   development of the OSM Semantic Network by means of a web crawler
   tailored to the OSM Wiki website; this semantic network can be used to
   compute semantic similarity through co-citation measures, providing a
   novel semantic tool for OSM and GIS communities; (2) a study of the
   cognitive plausibility (i.e. the ability to replicate human judgement)
   of co-citation algorithms when applied to the computation of semantic
   similarity of geographic concepts. Empirical evidence supports the usage
   of co-citation algorithms-SimRank showing the highest plausibility-to
   compute concept similarity in a crowdsourced semantic network.}},

Abstract = {{Natural disasters such as earthquakes and tsunamis occur all over the
   world, altering the physical landscape and often severely disrupting
   people's daily lives. Recently researchers' attention has focused on
   using crowds of volunteers to help map the damaged infrastructure and
   devastation caused by natural disasters, such as those in Haiti and
   Pakistan. This data is extremely useful, as it is allows us to assess
   damage and thus aid the distribution of relief, but it tells us little
   about how the people in such areas will react to the devastation. This
   paper demonstrates a prototype spatially explicit agent-based model,
   created using crowdsourced geographic information and other sources of
   publicly available data, which can be used to study the aftermath of a
   catastrophic event. The specific case modelled here is the Haiti
   earthquake of January 2010. Crowdsourced data is used to build the
   initial populations of people affected by the event, to construct their
   environment, and to set their needs based on the damage to buildings. We
   explore how people react to the distribution of aid, as well as how
   rumours relating to aid availability propagate through the population.
   Such a model could potentially provide a link between socio-cultural
   information about the people affected and the relevant humanitarian
   relief organizations. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Several studies show the impacts of (geo)social media and Volunteered
   Geographic Information (VGI) during crisis events, and have found
   intrinsic value for rescue teams, relief workers and humanitarian
   assistance coordinators, as well as the affected population. The main
   challenge is how emergency management and the public can capitalize on
   the abundance of this new source of information by reducing the volume
   to credible and relevant content.
   In this paper, we present the GeoCONAVI (Geographic CONtext Analysis for
   Volunteered Information) approach and a prototype system, designed to
   retrieve, process, analyze and evaluate social media content on forest
   fires, producing relevant, credible and actionable VGI usable for crisis
   events. The novelty of the approach lies in the enrichment of the
   content with additional geographic context information, and use of
   spatio-temporal clustering to support scoring and validation. Thus, the
   system is focusing on integrating authoritative data sources with VGI.
   Evaluation in case studies shows that the prototype system can handle
   large amounts of data with common-off-the-shelf hardware, produces
   valuable results, and is adaptable to other types of crisis events. (C)

Abstract = {{European Alpine glaciology has a long tradition of studies and
   activities, in which researchers have often relied on the field work of
   some specialized volunteer operators. Despite the remarkable results of
   this cooperation, some problems in field data harmonization and in
   covering the whole range of monitored glaciers are still present.
   Moreover, dynamics of reduction, fragmentation and decline, which in
   recent decades characterize Alpine glaciers, make more urgent the need
   to improve spatial and temporal monitoring, still maintaining adequate
   quality standards. Scientific field monitoring activities on Alpine
   glaciers run parallel to a number of initiatives by individuals and
   amateur associations, keepers of alternative, experiential and
   para-scientific knowledge of the glacial environment. Problems of
   harmonization, coordination, recruitment and updating can be addressed
   with the help of a collaborative approach-citizen science-like-in which
   the scientific coordination guarantees information quality and web 2.0
   tools operate as mediators between expert glaciologists and non-expert
   contributors. This paper gives an overview of glaciological information
   currently produced in the European Alpine region, representing it in an
   organized structure, functional to the discussion. An empowering
   solution is then proposed, both methodological and technological, for
   the integration of multisource data. Its characteristics, potentials and

Abstract = {{The increasing availability of sensor devices has resulted in important
   volumes of sensor data, which has raised the issue of making these data
   fully discoverable and interpretable by applications and end-users. The
   idea of OGC Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) has addressed this issue by
   proposing a set of standards to enable accessibility of sensor data over
   the Web. Similarly, there is a growing interest in volunteered
   geographic information (VGI). Considering that several researchers have
   highlighted the potential of this new type of information as a
   complement to existing, ``traditional{''} data, it becomes important to
   develop frameworks to support the integration of VGI from several
   sources and with other types of data. In this paper, we make a first
   step in this direction by proposing a framework for the semantic
   interoperability of sensor data and VGI. After having performed an
   investigation of the types of VGI applications, we have developed a
   conceptual model of VGI aligned with relevant ISO standards for
   describing geospatial features. The purpose of this model is to support
   the generation of common descriptions for VGI applications, which will
   act as interfaces to higher-level services, such as discovery and
   reasoning services, in order to be exploited in conjunction with sensor
   data by client applications. This process is described through
   architecture for semantic interoperability of sensor data and VGI that
   we have developed and that we intend to use to set guidelines for future
   research on integration of VGI in sensor data cyberinfrastructures. We
   illustrate the possibilities created by the proposed framework with a
   description of the various services and interfaces required to implement
   the framework.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{23}},
Pages = {{37-48}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{There is much interest in using volunteered geographic information (VGI)
   in formal scientific analyses. This analysis uses VGI describing land
   cover that was captured using a web-based interface, linked to Google
   Earth. A number of control points, for which the land cover had been
   determined by experts allowed measures of the reliability of each
   volunteer in relation to each land cover class to be calculated.
   Geographically weighted kernels were used to estimate surfaces of
   volunteered land cover information accuracy and then to develop
   spatially distributed correspondences between the volunteer land cover
   class and land cover from 3 contemporary global datasets (GLC-2000,
   GlobCover and MODIS v.5). Specifically, a geographically weighted
   approach calculated local confusion matrices (correspondences) at each
   location in a central African study area and generated spatial
   distributions of user's, producer's, portmanteau, and partial
   portmanteau accuracies. These were used to evaluate the global datasets
   and to infer which of them was `best' at describing Tree cover at each
   location in the study area. The resulting maps show where specific
   global datasets are recommended for analyses requiring Tree cover
   information. The methods presented in this research suggest that some of
   the concerns about the quality of VGI can be addressed through careful
   data collection, the use of control points to evaluate volunteer
   performance and spatially explicit analyses. A research agenda for the
   use and analysis of VGI about land cover is outlined. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{There is currently a lack of in-situ environmental data for the
   calibration and validation of remotely sensed products and for the
   development and verification of models. Crowdsourcing is increasingly
   being seen as one potentially powerful way of increasing the supply of
   in-situ data but there are a number of concerns over the subsequent use
   of the data, in particular over data quality. This paper examined
   crowdsourced data from the Geo-Wiki crowdsourcing tool for land cover
   validation to determine whether there were significant differences in
   quality between the answers provided by experts and non-experts in the
   domain of remote sensing and therefore the extent to which crowdsourced
   data describing human impact and land cover can be used in further
   scientific research. The results showed that there was little difference
   between experts and non-experts in identifying human impact although
   results varied by land cover while experts were better than non-experts
   in identifying the land cover type. This suggests the need to create
   training materials with more examples in those areas where difficulties
   in identification were encountered, and to offer some method for
   contributors to reflect on the information they contribute, perhaps by
   feeding back the evaluations of their contributed data or by making
   additional training materials available. Accuracies were also found to
   be higher when the volunteers were more consistent in their responses at
   a given location and when they indicated higher confidence, which
   suggests that these additional pieces of information could be used in
   the development of robust measures of quality in the future.}},

   producer's accuracy of forest and of forest extent derived from the free
   and volunteered data using a latent class model were of comparable
   magnitude to those derived in a formal validation by experts; the
   estimate of forest extent was within 1.38-9.08\% of reference estimates

Abstract = {{The assessment of the quality and accuracy of Volunteered Geographic
   Information (VGI) contributions, and by extension the ultimate utility
   of VGI data has fostered much debate within the geographic community.
   The limited research to date has been focused on VGI data of linear
   features and has shown that the error in the data is heterogeneously
   distributed. Some have argued that data produced by numerous
   contributors will produce a more accurate product than an individual and
   some research on crowd-sourced initiatives has shown that to be true,
   although research on VGI is more infrequent. This paper proposes a
   method for quantifying the completeness and accuracy of a select subset

   whether the OSM road network should be updated through periodic data

   US Census TIGER/Line 2005 import into OSM was accomplished in early
   2008, which generated a road network foundation for the active community
   members in the US. In this study we perform a longitudinal analysis of

   data since the initial TIGER/Line import. The analysis is performed for
   the 50 US states and the District of Columbia, and 70 Urbanized Areas.
   In almost all tested states and Urbanized Areas, OSM misses roads for

Abstract = {{With the increased availability of user generated data, assessing the
   quality and credibility of such data becomes important. In this article,
   we propose to assess the location correctness of visually generated
   Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) as a quality reference measure.
   The location correctness is determined by checking the visibility of the
   point of interest from the position of the visually generated VGI
   (observer point); as an example we utilize Flickr photographs. Therefore
   we first collect all Flickr photographs that conform to a certain point
   of interest through their textual labelling. Then we conduct a reverse
   viewshed analysis for the point of interest to determine if it lies
   within the area of visibility of the observer points. If the point of
   interest lies outside the visibility of a given observer point, the
   respective geotagged image is considered to be incorrectly geotagged. In
   this way, we analyze sample datasets of photographs and make
   observations regarding the dependency of certain user/photo metadata and
   (in)correct geotags and labels. In future the dependency relationship
   between the location correctness and user/photo metadata can be used to
   automatically infer user credibility. In other words, attributes such as
   profile completeness, together with location correctness, can serve as a
   weighted score to assess credibility.}},

Abstract = {{The vision of a Digital Earth calls for more dynamic information
   systems, new sources of information, and stronger capabilities for their
   integration. Sensor networks have been identified as a major information
   source for the Digital Earth, while Semantic Web technologies have been
   proposed to facilitate integration. So far, sensor data are stored and
   published using the Observations \& Measurements standard of the Open
   Geospatial Consortium (OGC) as data model. With the advent of
   Volunteered Geographic Information and the Semantic Sensor Web, work on
   an ontological model gained importance within Sensor Web Enablement
   (SWE). In contrast to data models, an ontological approach abstracts
   from implementation details by focusing on modeling the physical world
   from the perspective of a particular domain. Ontologies restrict the
   interpretation of vocabularies toward their intended meaning. The
   ongoing paradigm shift to Linked Sensor Data complements this attempt.
   Two questions have to be addressed: (1) how to refer to changing and
   frequently updated data sets using Uniform Resource Identifiers, and (2)
   how to establish meaningful links between those data sets, that is,
   observations, sensors, features of interest, and observed properties? In
   this paper, we present a Linked Data model and a RESTful proxy for OGC's
   Sensor Observation Service to improve integration and inter-linkage of
   observation data for the Digital Earth.}},

Abstract = {{About one decade has passed since US vice president Al Gore articulated
   his vision of Digital Earth (DE). Within this decade, a global
   multi-resolution and three-dimensional (3D) representation of the Earth,
   which sums up the DE vision, increasingly gained interest in both public
   and science. Due to the desired high resolution of the available data,
   highly detailed 3D city models comprise a huge part of DE and they are
   becoming an essential and useful tool for a range of different
   applications. In the past as well as at present, 3D models normally come
   from a range of different sources generated by professionals, such as
   laser scans or photogrammetry combined with 2D cadaster data. Some
   models are generated with semi-automated or fully automated approaches,
   but in most cases manual fine tuning or even manual construction from
   architectural plans is required. Further beyond outdoor city models, DE
   additionally envisages the provision of indoor information. That is, the
   interior structure of public or publically accessible buildings, such as
   airports or shopping malls, is represented and made available in 3D;
   however, at the moment, such models are mostly created by hand and
   essentially based on professional data sources. In contrast to such
   professional data, which is mainly captured by surveyors or companies,
   the last few years revealed the phenomenon of crowdsourced geodata,
   which receives an increasing attractiveness as an alternative data
   source for many Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Former research
   already demonstrated the power and richness of such geodata especially
   OpenStreetMap (OSM) and it has also been proved that this
   non-standardized, crowdsourced geodata can be combined with
   international standards of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). For
   example, CityGML Level-of-Detail 1 (LoD1) and LoD2 models have already
   been created automatically from OSM. The research presented in this
   article will further continue on the automated generation of CityGML
   models from OpenStreetMap. Essentially, a method for the creation of
   highly detailed CityGML LoD4 models with interior structures will be
   explained. By applying the invented approach on existing OSM data,
   limitations and restrictions of the IndoorOSM mapping proposal, the
   available data and the developed approach are revealed and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes the digital dimensions of places as represented by

   experiences of the city. These digital layers are invisible to the naked
   eye, but form a central component of the augmentations and mediations of
   place enabled by hundreds of millions of mobile computing devices and
   other digital technologies. The analysis highlights how these
   augmentations of place differ across space and language and highlights
   both the differences and some of the causal factors behind them. This is
   performed through a global study of all online content indexed within
   Google Maps, and more specific analyses of the linguistically and
   topically segregated layers of information over four selected places.
   The uneven linguistic geographies that this study reveals undoubtedly
   influence the many ways in which place is enacted and brought into
   being. The larger aim of this project is to use these initial mappings
   of the linguistic contours of the geoweb to push forward a broader

   How can the OSM project protect itself against data vandalism? To be
   able to give a sophisticated answer to this question, different cases of

   for the project by the end of 2011. However, while this number of
   contributors seems impressive, questions remain about the individual
   contributions that have been made by the project members. This research
   article contains several studies regarding the contributions by the
   community of the project. The results show that only 38\% (192,000) of
   the registered members carried out at least one edit in the OSM database
   and that only 5\% (24,000) of all members actively contributed to the
   project in a more productive way. The majority of the members are
   located in Europe (72\%) and each member has an activity area whose size
   may range from one soccer field up to more than 50 km(2). In addition to
   several more analyses conducted for this article, predictions will be
   made about how this newly acquired knowledge can be used for future

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{1}},

Pages = {{186-208}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Crowdsourced geodata has been proven to be a rich and major data source
   for environmental simulations and analysis, as well as the visualization
   of spatial phenomena. With the increasing size and complexity of public
   buildings, such as universities or hotels, there is also an increasing
   demand for information about indoor spaces. Trying to stimulate this
   growing demand, both researchers and Volunteered Geographic Information
   (VGI) communities envision to extend established communities towards
   indoors. It has already been showcased that VGI from OpenStreetMap (OSM)
   can be utilized for different applications in Spatial Data
   Infrastructures (SDIs) as well as for simple shortest path computations
   inside buildings. The here presented research now tries to utilize
   crowdsourced indoor geodata for more complex indoor routing scenarios of
   multiple users. Essentially, it will be investigated if, and to what
   extent, the available data can be utilized for performing indoor
   evacuation simulations with the simulation framework MATSim. That is,
   this paper investigates the suitability of crowdsourced indoor
   information from OSM (IndoorOSM) for evacuation simulations.
   Additionally, the applicability of MATSim for agent-based indoor
   evacuation simulations is conducted. The paper discusses the automatic
   generation simulation-related data, and provides experimental results
   for two different evacuation scenarios. Furthermore, limitations of the
   IndoorOSM data and the MATSim framework for indoor evacuation
   simulations are elaborated and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents one of the first systematic usability
   investigations for a Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) editor.
   This research is motivated by the fact that although VGI is now widely
   consumed, contribution rates are lagging considerably. Compared to
   traditional GIS interfaces, with complex interfaces resulting in high
   cognitive loads and barriers to participation, VGI tools and interfaces
   need to be easy to use and learn to encourage and facilitate
   contributions. This article develops a case study of OpenStreetMap, one
   of the most successful VGI projects, and its default editor, Potlatch2.
   Ten participants with no prior experience of VGI contribution, were
   instructed to contribute data to OSM in a structured exercise, while
   being monitored using an eye tracker and audio/video screen capture
   software. Each participant was asked to Think Aloud, i.e. describe what
   they were thinking and doing as they completed the tasks. The results
   highlight significant usability issues impacting learnability,
   especially from the perspective of a new contributor: hidden
   functionality, lack of user feedback between interactions and the
   inefficient and inconsistent placement of functionality and map
   controls. The facilitation of VGI contributions clearly depends on
   designing targeted interfaces, optimized to the needs of specific levels
   of contributors with defined goals and expectations.}},

Abstract = {{New, free and fast growing spatial data sources have appeared online,

   is one of the most representative projects of this trend. Its increasing

   be meaningful, and is usually performed manually at the data preparation
   stage. This article proposes an automated feature-based matching method
   specifically designed for VGI, based on a multi-stage approach that
   combines geometric and attribute constraints. It is applied to the OSM

Abstract = {{Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) has the potential to offer

   framework of information relevance was used to understand the attributes
   of information that were most important in relation to the
   characteristics of the users' activity and their community. The key
   finding was that the discussion amongst GIS designers should not be
   whether to choose VGI or PGI as the information data set, but to
   consider which combination of VGI and PGI relating to different
   geographic features and task characteristics would best meet the users'
   needs. VGI is likely to be most relevant to the user when a geographic
   feature is dynamic rather than static in nature, and can also provide a
   level of detail that is unlikely to arise through PGI. These findings
   have implications for how different forms of information are most

Abstract = {{What make citizens participate in mapping projects? What motivates them
   to get involved in a non-hierarchical network of individuals who

   participate in cadastral mapping as an alternative way to speed up the
   cadastral survey and minimise the costs and errors which rise when
   traditional procedures allow limited owners' participation? The answers
   are still ambiguous. However, it is a fact that the way geospatial data

   dramatically during the last years. The paper briefly gives an
   introduction on the evolution of Neogeography and the citizens'
   involvement in spatial data collection, editing and uploading on the

Abstract = {{Disabled people, especially the blind and vision-impaired, are
   challenged by many transitory hazards in urban environments such as
   construction barricades, temporary fencing across walkways, and
   obstacles along curbs. These hazards present a problem for navigation,
   because they typically appear in an unplanned manner and are seldom
   included in databases used for accessibility mapping. Tactile maps are a
   traditional tool used by blind and vision-impaired people for navigation
   through urban environments, but such maps are not automatically updated
   with transitory hazards. As an alternative approach to static content on
   tactile maps, we use volunteered geographic information (VGI) and an
   Open Source system to provide updates of local infrastructure. These VGI
   updates, contributed via voice, text message, and e-mail, use geographic
   descriptions containing place names to describe changes to the local
   environment. After they have been contributed and stored in a database,
   we georeference VGI updates with a detailed gazetteer of local place
   names including buildings, administrative offices, landmarks, roadways,
   and dormitories. We publish maps and alerts showing transitory hazards,
   including location-based alerts delivered to mobile devices. Our system
   is built with several technologies including PHP, JavaScript, AJAX,
   Google Maps API, PostgreSQL, an Open Source database, and PostGIS, the
   PostgreSQL's spatial extension. This article provides insight into the

   types of users (from targeted citizen-based observation networks,
   expert-driven focused monitoring, and opportunistic crowdsourcing
   efforts) in monitoring a forest disease in the western United States. We
   first introduce the overall challenge of data collection in
   environmental monitoring projects and then discuss the literature
   surrounding an emergent integration of citizen science and volunteered
   geographical information. We next explore how these methods characterize
   and underpin knowledge discovery and how multimodal interaction is
   supported so that a large spectrum of contributors can be included.
   These concepts are summarized in a conceptual model that articulates the
   important gradients of Web-based environmental monitoring: the users,
   the interaction between users and data, and the types of information
   generated. Using this model, we critically examine OakMapper.org, a Web
   site created by the authors to collect and distribute spatial
   information related to the spread of a forest disease, and discuss many
   of the core issues and new challenges presented by the intersection of
   citizen science and volunteered geographic information in the context of

Abstract = {{The convergence of newly interactive Web-based technologies with growing
   practices of user-generated content disseminated on the Internet is
   generating a remarkable new form of geographic information. Citizens are
   using handheld devices to collect geographic information and contribute
   it to crowd-sourced data sets, using Web-based mapping interfaces to
   mark and annotate geographic features, or adding geographic location to
   photographs, text, and other media shared online. These phenomena, which
   generate what we refer to collectively as volunteered geographic
   information (VGI), represent a paradigmatic shift in how geographic
   information is created and shared and by whom, as well as its content
   and characteristics. This article, which draws on our recently completed
   inventory of VGI initiatives, is intended to frame the crucial
   dimensions of VGI for geography and geographers, with an eye toward
   identifying its potential in our field, as well as the most pressing
   research needed to realize this potential. Drawing on our ongoing
   research, we examine the content and characteristics of VGI, the
   technical and social processes through which it is produced, appropriate
   methods for synthesizing and using these data in research, and emerging
   social and political concerns related to this new form of information.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{215-229}},
Abstract = {{Scaling of geographic space refers to the fact that for a large
   geographic area its small constituents or units are much more common
   than the large ones. This article develops a novel perspective to the
   scaling of geographic space using large street networks involving both
   cities and countryside. Given a street network of an entire country, we
   decompose the street network into individual blocks, each of which forms
   a minimum ring or cycle such as city blocks and field blocks. The block
   sizes demonstrate the scaling property, that is, far more small blocks
   than large ones. Interestingly, we find that the mean of all the block
   sizes can easily separate between small and large blocks -a high
   percentage (e.g., 90\%) of smaller ones and a low percentage (e.g.,
   10\%) of larger ones. Based on this regularity, termed as the head/tail
   division rule, we propose an approach to delineating city boundaries by
   grouping the smaller blocks. The extracted city sizes for the three
   largest European countries (France, Germany, and United Kingdom) exhibit
   power law distributions. We further define the concept of border number
   as a topological distance of a block far from the outmost border to map
   the center(s) of the country and the city. We draw an analogy between a
   country (or a city or geographic space in general) and a complex
   organism like the human body or the human brain to further elaborate on
   the power of this block perspective in reflecting the structure or
   patterns of geographic space.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1437-1456}},
Abstract = {{One difficulty in integrating geospatial data sets from different
   sources is variation in feature classification and semantic content of
   the data. One step towards achieving beneficial semantic
   interoperability is to assess the semantic similarity among objects that
   are categorised within data sets. This article focuses on measuring
   semantic and structural similarities between categories of formal data,
   such as Ordnance Survey (OS) cartographic data, and volunteered
   geographic information (VGI), such as that sourced from OpenStreetMap
   (OSM), with the intention of assessing possible integration. The model
   involves `tokenisation' to search for common roots of words, and the
   feature classifications have been modelled as an XML schema labelled
   rooted tree for hierarchical analysis. The semantic similarity was
   measured using the WordNet::Similarity package, while the structural
   similarities between sub-trees of the source and target schemas have
   also been considered. Along with dictionary and structural matching, the
   data type of the category itself is a comparison variable. The overall
   similarity is based on a weighted combination of these three measures.
   The results reveal that the use of a generic similarity matching system
   leads to poor agreement between the semantics of OS and OSM data sets.
   It is concluded that a more rigorous peer-to-peer assessment of VGI
   data, increasing numbers and transparency of contributors, the
   initiation of more programs of quality testing and the development of
   more directed ontologies can improve spatial data integration.}},

Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{Geocoding urban addresses usually requires the use of an underlying
   address database. Under the influence of the format defined for TIGER
   files decades ago, most address databases and street geocoding
   algorithms are organized around street centerlines, associating
   numbering ranges to thoroughfare segments between two street crossings.
   While this method has been successfully employed in the USA for a long
   time, its transposition to other countries may lead to increased errors.
   This article presents an evaluation of the centerline-geocoding
   resources provided by Google Maps, as compared to the point-geocoding
   method used in the city of Belo Horizonte, Brazil, which we took as a
   baseline. We generated a textual address for each point object found in
   the city's point-based address database, and submitted it to the Google
   Maps geocoding API. We then compared the resulting coordinates with the
   ones recorded in Belo Horizonte's GIS. We demonstrate that the
   centerline segment interpolation method, employed by the online
   resources following the American practice, has problems that can
   considerably influence the quality of the geocoding outcome.
   Completeness and accuracy have been found to be irregular, especially
   within lower income areas. Such errors in online services can have a
   significant impact on geocoding efforts related to social applications,
   such as public health and education, since the online service can be
   faulty and error-prone in the most socially demanding areas of the city.
   In the conclusion, we point out that a volunteered geographic
   information (VGI) approach can help with the enrichment and enhancement
   of current geocoding resources, and can possibly lead to their
   transformation into more reliable point-based geocoding services.}},

Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1115-1122}},

Abstract = {{Landscape scenery is inherently difficult to conceptualize because of
   its perceptual nature. Yet landscapes are an extremely important
   resource for tourism and quality of life so there is a need to classify
   and manage landscapes. This paper shows how viewshed analysis based on
   the known location and direction of a photo can be used to tag a photo
   and this provides a method for assessing the New Zealand Landscape
   Classification. GIS visibility and overlay functions are combined with
   digital elevation data and a landscape classification to produce the
   tagged photos. This tool links an oblique view with multiple distance
   perspectives to a GIS dataset. There are complexities associated with
   distance perspectives and the appropriate balance of foreground and
   distant landscape. This paper argues that the benefits of automated
   tagging of landscape photos are threefold. The process of modelling
   landscape tags forces researchers to confront the complexity of
   landscape character classification. This in turn leads to improved
   methods for representing and classifying landscape character. Secondly,
   once tagging methods have been developed then people may choose to use
   these tools rather than to manually tag photos. Thirdly, such a tool
   provides the opportunity to utilize the increasingly important
   volunteered geographic information on the Internet for understanding
   landscape categories. Landscape photographs and associated tags on the
   Internet provide insight about landscape categories employed by the
   public. This could lead to the development of what is labelled ``tag
   clouds{''} and a landscape ``folksonomy{''}. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Do local landmark bridges increase the suicide rate? An alternative test

Journal = {{SOCIAL SCIENCE \& MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{6}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{A number of recent studies have examined the effect of installing
   physical barriers or otherwise restricting access to public sites that
   are frequently used for suicides by jumping. While these studies
   demonstrate that barriers lead to a reduction in the number of suicides
   by jumping at the site where they are installed, thus far no study has
   found a statistically significant reduction in the local suicide rate
   attributable to a barrier. All previous studies are case studies of
   particular sites, and thus have limited statistical power and ability to
   control for confounding factors, which may obscure the true relationship
   between barriers and the suicide rate. This study addresses these
   concerns by examining the relationship between large, well-known bridges
   ({''}local landmark{''} bridges) of the type that are often used as
   suicide-jumping sites and the local suicide rate, an approach that
   yields many more cases for analysis. If barriers at suicide-jumping
   sites decrease the local suicide rate, then this implies that the
   presence of an unsecured suicide-jumping site will lead to a higher
   local suicide rate in comparison to areas without such a site. The
   relationship between suicides and local landmark bridges is examined
   across 3116 US counties or county equivalents with negative binomial
   regression models. I found that while exposure to local landmark bridges
   was associated with an increased number of suicides by jumping, no
   positive relationship between these bridges and the overall number of
   suicides was detected. It may be impossible to conclusively determine if
   barriers at suicide-jumping sites reduce the local suicide rate with
   currently available data. However, the method introduced in this paper
   offers the possibility that better data, or an improved understanding of
   which potential jumping sites attract suicidal individuals, may
   eventually allow researchers to determine if means restriction at
   suicide-jumping sites reduces total suicides. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Volume = {{42}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{6-15}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Blogging, social networking, and other Web 2.0 practices have sparked
   widespread debate about the status and future of privacy. This paper
   examines an explicitly geographical aspect of Web 2.0 with respect to
   these debates: the geospatial web, or `geoweb'. As part of fundamental
   shifts in the kinds of geographic information available, its
   circulation, and representative forms it assumes, the geoweb implies new
   objects of privacy concern and subsequent privacy-related negotiations
   over the aggregate of its component information, technologies, and data
   praxes. Thus we argue that privacy must not only be revisited, but
   indeed re-conceptualized. Whereas prior research on privacy vis--vis
   geographic information technologies has tended to question what privacy
   `is', we focus instead on the constitutive outcomes of societal
   struggles over privacy. We examine how privacy is being negotiated
   around two geoweb services - Google Street View and the Twitter GeoAPI -
   to illustrate that these contestations produce privacy as a social
   object in particular ways. We show that public discourse around actual
   or anticipated privacy harms stemming from geoweb services and their
   uses, as well as the preventatives and remedies proposed or implemented
   to address such harms, reconstitute the objects and practices of privacy
   concern, and alter the roles and relationships of state, civil and
   corporate actors in the construction of privacy. Finally we suggest that
   the geoweb raises new privacy concerns because some of its
   representational forms - namely geo-tagged images and self-authored
   texts - facilitate identification and disclosure with more immediacy and
   less abstraction. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Availability of a transit service is a key factor in a traveler's choice

   network that includes pedestrian segments, that is, shortcuts, is highly
   important for a realistic assessment of service areas. Whereas most
   proprietary geodata providers concentrate solely on car-related geodata,
   public domain street data and volunteered geographic information, such
   as OpenStreetMap, provide a potential valuable source for pedestrian
   data. The authors compared the amount of pedestrian-related data between
   freely available sources (OpenStreetMap or TIGER or both) and
   proprietary providers (Tele Atlas or NAVTEQ or both). The effect on
   modeling transit accessibility for pedestrians was analyzed for five
   U.S. and four German cities, and differences between these two countries
   were identified.}},

Abstract = {{The amateur birding community has a long and proud tradition of
   contributing to bird surveys and bird atlases. Coordinated activities
   such as Breeding Bird Atlases and the Christmas Bird Count are examples
   of ``citizen science{''} projects. With the advent of technology, Web
   2.0 sites such as eBird have been developed to facilitate online sharing
   of data and thus increase the potential for real-time monitoring.
   However, as recently articulated in an editorial in this journal and
   elsewhere, monitoring is best served when based on a priori hypotheses.
   Harnessing citizen scientists to collect data following a
   hypothetico-deductive approach carries challenges. Moreover, the use of
   citizen science in scientific and monitoring studies has raised issues
   of data accuracy and quality. These issues are compounded when data
   collection moves into the Web 2.0 world. An examination of the
   literature from social geography on the concept of ``citizen sensors{''}
   and volunteered geographic information (VGI) yields thoughtful
   reflections on the challenges of data quality/data accuracy when
   applying information from citizen sensors to research and management
   questions. VGI has been harnessed in a number of contexts, including for
   environmental and ecological monitoring activities. Here, I argue that
   conceptualizing a monitoring project as an experiment following the
   scientific method can further contribute to the use of VGI. I show how
   principles of experimental design can be applied to monitoring projects
   to better control for data quality of VGI. This includes suggestions for
   how citizen sensors can be harnessed to address issues of experimental
   controls and how to design monitoring projects to increase randomization
   and replication of sampled data, hence increasing scientific reliability
   and statistical power.}},

   the number of contributors who have worked on a given spatial unit. The
   assumption that as the number of contributors increases so does the
   quality is known as `Linus' Law' within the open source community. This
   paper describes three studies that were carried out to evaluate this
   hypothesis for VGI using the OpenStreetMap dataset, showing that this

Abstract = {{Incorporating the temporal element into traditional GIS is a challenge
   that has been researched for many years and has many proposed solutions.
   The implemented system ``Extended Dynamic GIS{''} or EDGIS is based on
   the ``geo-atom{''} and Space Time Point (STP). EDGIS provides a platform
   for spatiotemporal data representation, storage, and query in order to
   address the need for a dynamic GIS to manage complex geographic data
   types. The system has the capability of executing spatiotemporal object
   interaction queries (OIQs) such as crossing and coincidence of
   field-objects and object-fields. In this article existing dynamic GIS
   analysis techniques are further improved and enhanced through
   exploration of more in-depth case studies. Further examined here are
   applications to wildfire evacuation modeling and travel scenarios of
   urban environments with individuals providing volunteered geographic
   information (VGI). The EDGIS platform provides a means for interacting
   with a range of dynamic geographic phenomena. The areas of
   transportation, location based services (LBS), hazards, and geo-sensor

Journal = {{TRANSACTIONS IN GIS}},
Abstract = {{The quality of volunteered geographic information (VGI) is questionable
   as it emerges through a diversity of contributors. The reputation of a
   contributor is increasingly applied to VGI quality assessment and its
   assurance. Research on how to measure and validate reputation, however,
   is still required. This study proposes an evaluation-based weighted
   PageRank (EWPR) algorithm to provide a ranking metric of reputation.
   Ranking is established on the basis of the assumptions that: (a) there
   is an evaluation relationship between VGI contributors; (b) the
   reputation of a contributor is movable within the VGI community; and (c)
   highly active contributors are more likely to have high reputation. By
   means of case studies using OpenStreetMap, two existing methods are
   compared with the EWPR algorithm. The results show that the algorithms
   used for web pages and social network participants are applicable to
   understand the reputation of VGI contributors. This study also applies
   credibility, based on reputation, as a popular indicator of VGI quality.
   The high correlation between credibility and VGI characteristics

Abstract = {{Representations of geographic entities captured in popular knowledge
   graphs such as Wikidata and DBpedia are often incomplete. OpenStreetMap
   (OSM) is a rich source of openly available, volunteered geographic
   information that has a high potential to complement these
   representations. However, identity links between the knowledge graph
   entities and OSM nodes are still rare. The problem of link discovery in
   these settings is particularly challenging due to the lack of a strict
   schema and heterogeneity of the user-defined node representations in
   OSM. In this article, we propose OSM2KG a novel link discovery approach
   to predict identity links between OSM nodes and geographic entities in a
   knowledge graph. The core of the OSM2KG approach is a novel latent,
   compact representation of OSM nodes that captures semantic node
   similarity in an embedding. OSM2KG adopts this latent representation to
   train a supervised model for link prediction and utilises existing links
   between OSM and knowledge graphs for training. Our experiments conducted
   on several OSM datasets, as well as the Wikidata and DBpedia knowledge
   graphs, demonstrate that OSM2KG can reliably discover identity links.
   OSM2KG achieves an F1 score of 92.05\% on Wikidata and of 94.17\% on

   increase in F1 score on Wikidata compared to the best performing

Abstract = {{In situ ground truth data are an important requirement for producing
   accurate cropland type map, and this is precisely what is lacking at
   vast scales. Although volunteered geographic information (VGI) has been
   proven as a possible solution for in situ data acquisition, processing
   and extracting valuable information from millions of pictures remains
   challenging. This paper targets the detection of specific crop types
   from crowdsourced road view photos. A first large, public, multiclass
   road view crop photo dataset named iCrop was established for the
   development of crop type detection with deep learning. Five
   state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural networks including
   InceptionV4, DenseNet121, ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and ShuffleNetV2 were
   employed to compare the baseline performance. ResNet50 outperformed the

   outperformed the others according to the efficiency (13 FPS). The
   decision fusion schemes major voting was used to further improve crop
   identification accuracy. The results clearly demonstrate the superior
   accuracy of the proposed decision fusion over the other non-fusion-based
   methods in crop type detection of imbalanced road view photos dataset.
   The voting method achieved higher mean accuracy (90.6-91.1\%) and can be
   leveraged to classify crop type in crowdsourced road view photos.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{By 2050, half of the net increase in the world's population is expected
   to reside in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), driving high urbanization rates
   and drastic land cover changes. However, the data-scarce environment of
   SSA limits our understanding of the urban dynamics in the region. In
   this context, Earth Observation (EO) is an opportunity to gather
   accurate and up-to-date spatial information on urban extents. During the
   last decade, the adoption of open-access policies by major EO programs
   (CBERS, Landsat, Sentinel) has allowed the production of several global
   high resolution (10-30 m) maps of human settlements. However, mapping
   accuracies in SSA are usually lower, limited by the lack of reference
   datasets to support the training and the validation of the
   classification models. Here we propose a mapping approach based on
   multi-sensor satellite imagery (Landsat, Sentinel-1, Envisat, ERS) and
   volunteered geographic information (OpenStreetMap) to solve the
   challenges of urban remote sensing in SSA. The proposed mapping approach
   is assessed in 17 case studies for an average F1-score of 0.93, and
   applied in 45 urban areas of SSA to produce a dataset of urban expansion
   from 1995 to 2015. Across the case studies, built-up areas averaged a

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{94}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Tectonic plate motion affects coordinates resulting from GPS
   measurements and the referencing of aerial and satellite imagery. It
   therefore impacts the long-term use of global coordinate systems. Over
   time, the tectonic plates move relative to each other and coordinates
   become outdated. Most geographic datasets including OpenStreetMap are no
   exception, as these are affected in terms of a growing
   location-coordinate mismatch. Current research is aware of this issue
   but solution strategies have not been fully explored yet. In this
   manuscript, we discuss how regular systematic updates of coordinate
   values can be used to address this issue. We explore the recommended
   frequency to perform such updates for guaranteeing a minimal loss of
   accuracy after long periods of time. It is further determined how
   rounding errors impair such systematic updates and in which ways
   singular and irregular manual updates impede systematic solution
   strategies. The solution strategies proposed lead to minimal overall
   errors and thus guarantee to retain high positional accuracy of
   coordinate pairs within global datasets, even after years of existence.}},

Title = {{A Methodology for Automatic Acquisition of Flood-event Management
   Information From Social Media: the Flood in Messinia, South Greece, 2016}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION SYSTEMS FRONTIERS}},
Abstract = {{Social network data, utilised as a VGI source, was analysed using the
   September 2016 flood event in Messinia, South Greece. The flood event
   led to damage in the urban and rural environment in the general area,
   and to human deaths. An innovative methodology is based on applying
   machine learning to classify Twitter content. Tweets were classified
   into the following ten categories: (i) flood identification, (ii) rain
   identification, (iii) consequences of the flood, (iv) expressed
   emotions, (v) ironic attitude to local disaster management authorities,
   (vi) disaster management information, (vii); volunteer actions, (viii);
   situation overview, (ix); social effects, and (x); weather information.
   Some of the categories were divided further, to quantify significant
   information. The classified output was sequentially geo-referenced by
   identifying geographic entities within the text of each post
   (geo-parsing) and replicating each post according to the number of
   geolocations. The data processing involved various geo-validations and
   performance metrics. The final output was used to create maps and graphs
   of different time periods, that provide useful insights into the flood
   event for disaster management purposes. The applied methodology is an
   evolution of previous research published by the author, this time
   providing complete results, based on the analysis of 100 \% of the data
   available, with maps and graphs which demonstrate how the flood event
   unfolded in different time periods. The methodology is fully automated
   in terms of data processing, and can be applied using a script developed
   by the author in the R programming language. This research is a step
   towards the real-time delivery of advanced information for all disaster
   management stakeholders, from official authorities and rescue teams, to
   volunteers and locals who may be situated within the area of a
   disastrous flood occurrence.}},

Abstract = {{Brazil has a large area with missing or outdated mapping on the largest

   with the semantic compatibility between the conceptual models adopted in

   continues with the identification of object classes with the most
   significant potential for integration. Finally, we developed some
   experiments to evaluate and validate the OSM data integration process in
   a 1:25,000 scale cartographic database. Even in regions with a recent
   mapping, the results of the preliminary assessment indicate the
   potential for an increase of about 52\% and 16\% of features in the

Abstract = {{With the development of Web2.0 and mobile Internet, urban residents, a

   put forward based on the case of Beijing, China, and includes the
   following three steps: (1) Obtain multi-source urban spatial data, such
   as Weibo data (equivalent to Twitter in Chinese), OpenStreetMap,
   population data, etc.; (2) Use the hierarchical clustering algorithm,
   term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) method, and improved
   k-means clustering algorithms to identify functional zones; (3) Compare
   the identified results with the actual urban land uses and verify its

Title = {{Toponym usage in social media in emergencies}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{52}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Emergency responders require accurate geographic information to locate
   and assess incidents reported on social media. Unfortunately, however,
   social media often lacks geographic metadata or includes geotags that
   inaccurately reflect the locations of reported events. Toponyms, place
   names in social media content, provide another source of geographic
   information yet toponym usage in emergencies remains poorly understood.
   To address this gap, this study examines toponym usage across 22,343
   tweets posted during a severe storm in the Northeastern United States.
   Tweets were qualitatively coded for nineteen types of storm-related
   information as well as toponym usage, location reference, and
   granularity. Findings show that users i) include more geographic
   information, including toponyms and geotags, in tweets about emergencies
   than about other topics; ii) report geographically distributed events
   but tend to include toponyms rather than geotags when reporting local
   information; and iii) include mostly municipal and regional toponyms in
   tweets about emergencies but tend to include hyperlocal toponyms and
   additional municipal or regional markers in reports of infrastructure
   damage and service disruption.
   Together these findings offer implications for social sensing
   applications in emergency response and management. These include more
   opportunities for course-grained damage assessment than fine-grained
   situational awareness, and the need for internal and external sources of
   geographic information to distinguish information about local and remote
   events. Lastly, findings suggest opportunities for passive and active
   sensing approaches responsive to the recipient design of social media:
   users provide additional geographic context that help others distinguish
   local and remote risks within noisy information spaces that emerge
   during geographically distributed crises.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past few decades, geoportals have been considered as the key
   technological solutions for easy access to Earth observation (EO)

   However, less attention has been paid to developing an efficient model

   model was developed based on the concepts of volunteered geographic
   information (VGI) and community-based geoportals using the latest open

   conceptualization of the frameworks for automated publishing of standard
   map services such as the Web Map Service (WMS) and the Web Coverage
   Service (WCS) from heterogeneous EO products prepared by volunteers as
   well as the communication portion to request voluntary publication of

Month = {{DEC 9}},
Abstract = {{Understanding cities as complex systems, sustainable urban planning
   depends on reliable high-resolution data, for example of the building
   stock to upscale region-wide retrofit policies. For some cities and
   regions, these data exist in detailed 3D models based on real-world
   measurements. However, they are still expensive to build and maintain, a
   significant challenge, especially for small and medium-sized cities that
   are home to the majority of the European population. New methods are
   needed to estimate relevant building stock characteristics reliably and
   cost-effectively. Here, we present a machine learning based method for
   predicting building heights, which is based only on open-access
   geospatial data on urban form, such as building footprints and street
   networks. The method allows to predict building heights for regions
   where no dedicated 3D models exist currently. We train our model using
   building data from four European countries (France, Italy, the
   Netherlands, and Germany) and find that the morphology of the urban
   fabric surrounding a given building is highly predictive of the height
   of the building. A test on the German state of Brandenburg shows that
   our model predicts building heights with an average error well below the
   typical floor height (about 2.5 m), without having access to training
   data from Germany. Furthermore, we show that even a small amount of
   local height data obtained by citizens substantially improves the
   prediction accuracy. Our results illustrate the possibility of
   predicting missing data on urban infrastructure; they also underline the
   value of open government data and volunteered geographic information for
   scientific applications, such as contextual but scalable strategies to
   mitigate climate change.}},

Abstract = {{Velocities within an icefall are typically the fastest within a glacier

   used. In this study, we exploit the high temporal revisit of
   medium-resolution satellite images using a novel image matching
   technique, ensemble matching, making it possible to generate a
   high-resolution (30 m) velocity field from high-repeat image sequences
   despite challenging image conditions. We demonstrate this technique for
   the first time in the glaciology domain using repeat Sentinel-2 optical
   data over the famous Khumbu icefall, situated on the southern slopes of
   Mount Everest. Estimates of velocity go just over 1 m d(-1), which is
   slower than summer velocities from noisy single pair image matching.
   This icefall is frequently crossed by high-altitude mountaineers who use
   a route confined by fixed ropes and ladders set out every season. The
   mountain climbers typically record their trajectory on their personal
   satellite navigation device. We use such volunteered geographic
   information to verify our velocity estimates, confirming our
   underestimation with ensemble matching. Besides unprecedented remotely

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of an exploratory quantitative analysis
   of gendered contributions to the online mapping project OpenStreetMap
   (OSM), in which previous research has identified a strong male
   participation bias. On these grounds, theories of representation in
   volunteered geographic information (VGI) have argued that this kind of
   crowdsourced data fails to embody the geospatial interests of the wider
   community. The observed effects of the bias however, remain
   conspicuously absent from discourses of VGI and gender, which proceed
   with little sense of impact. This study addresses this void by analysing
   OSM contributions by gender and thus identifies differences in men's and
   women's mapping practices. An online survey uniquely captured the OSM
   IDs as well as the declared gender of 293 OSM users. Statistics relating
   to users' editing and tagging behaviours openly accessible via the `how
   did you contribute to OSM' wiki page were subsequently analysed. The
   results reveal that volumes of overall activity as well editing and
   tagging actions in OSM remain significantly dominated by men. They also
   indicate subtle but impactful differences in men's and women's
   preferences for modifying and creating data, as well as the tagging
   categories to which they contribute. Discourses of gender and ICT,
   gender relations in online VGI environments and competing motivational
   factors are implicated in these observations. As well as updating
   estimates of the gender participation bias in OSM, this paper aims to
   inform and stimulate subsequent discourses of gender and representation
   towards a new rationale for widening participation in VGI.}},

Abstract = {{OpenStreetMap (OSM), often thought of as a technological tool or
   platform, can be envisioned as a community of communities and informed

   explore the community of university students known as YouthMappers, who
   utilize OSM and related tools for humanitarian data creation, analysis
   and learning. Students approach OSM simultaneously as aspiring members
   of the workforce in a global digital economy and as emerging world
   citizens of a global society. Established in 2014, YouthMappers is a
   campus-based consortium of more than 200 chapters in approximately 50
   countries that networks and supports engagement in humanitarian data
   with practitioners, government agencies, and other actors. Open
   geospatial data are contributed to authentic campaigns through
   OpenStreetMap and an ecosystem of open source and proprietary tools. A
   2019 survey of YouthMappers and an analysis of YouthMappers data
   contributions allow us to explore the following questions: Who are using
   open geospatial tools, and in what context? Which open geospatial tools
   are being used and where? How proficient are they as users? How
   confident do they feel? How prepared does this make them for the future?
   How do these patterns vary across the global digital divide? Results
   show evidence of mapping both locally and globally. They also reveal a
   gendered confidence gap, and tool use patterns hint at a gendered
   division of geospatial labor in some global contexts. Internships are
   key to unlocking job opportunities, and are prevalent among YouthMappers
   members. Findings also reveal that with growing self-reported
   proficiency, a commitment to the ethic of being a good global citizen

Title = {{A data fusion-based framework to integrate multi-source VGI in an
   authoritative land use database}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH}},
Abstract = {{Updating an authoritative Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) database
   requires many resources. Volunteered geographic information (VGI)
   involves citizens in the collection of data about their spatial
   environment. There is a growing interest in using existing VGI to update
   authoritative databases. This paper presents a framework aimed at
   integrating multi-source VGI based on a data fusion technique, in order
   to update an authoritative land use database. Each VGI data source is
   considered to be an independent source of information, which is fused
   together using Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST). The framework is tested in
   the updating of the authoritative land use data produced by the French
   National Mapping Agency. Four data sets were collected from several
   in-situ and remote campaigns run between 2018 and 2020 by contributors
   with varying profiles. The data fusion approach achieved an overall
   accuracy of 85.6\% for the 144 features having at least two
   contributions when the confidence threshold was set to 0.05. Despite the
   heterogeneity and limited amount of VGI used, the results are promising,
   with 99\% of the LU polygons updated or enriched. These results show the
   potential of using multi-source VGI to update or enrich authoritative LU
   data and potentially LULC data more generally.}},

Title = {{Regional variations of context-based association rules in OpenStreetMap}},
Journal = {{TRANSACTIONS IN GIS}},
Abstract = {{As a user-generated map of the whole world, OpenStreetMap (OSM) provides
   valuable information about the natural and built environment. However,
   the spatial heterogeneity of the data due to cultural differences and
   the spatially varying mapping process makes the extraction of reliable
   information difficult. This study investigates the variability of
   association rules extracted from OSM across different geographic regions
   and depending on different context variables, such as the number of OSM
   mappers. The focus of this study is the spatial co-occurrence of OSM
   tags mapped inside of parks within eight different cities. Without
   considering any context variable, most association rules were very
   region-specific without any rule being valid across all cities. Limiting
   the association rule analysis to parks based on specific context
   variables increased the number of rules which are applicable across
   multiple cities. Furthermore, additional region-specific association
   rules emerged. The most important context variables were found to be the
   number of features mapped inside the park, the number of tags and the
   park size. These results suggest that the mapping process has a
   significant influence on the emergence of association rules within
   user-generated data. Therefore, this subject needs further investigation
   to enable effective usage of OSM data across different cultural realms.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in geotagging, sharing and automatically analyzing
   online content from Social Networking Sites (SNS) offer unprecedented
   opportunities for the analysis of human-nature interactions. Previous
   studies in this field, however, offer limited insights regarding the
   benefits of automated content analysis especially at large scales,
   biases arising from the selection of SNS sources, and the predictive
   power of visitation models based on SNS data. We explore quantitative
   and qualitative aspects related to intensity, interests and sentiments
   associated with on-site experiences in 568 protected areas in Israel and
   the Palestinian Authority. We analyze counts and content of >100,000
   photographs and tweets from four different SNSs, calibrate visitation
   models and predict visitation in unmonitored sites, cluster sites based
   on the typology of human-nature interactions reflected in online
   photographs, and characterize the polarity of sentiments associated with
   experiences in individual sites and clusters thereof. We find benefits
   in combining data from multiple sources and controlling for biases
   related to sites' photogenicity and type of human-nature interactions.
   Our results suggest that current best estimates of visitation in

Abstract = {{Traditional agricultural extension services rely on extension workers,
   especially in countries with large agricultural areas. In order to
   increase adoption of sustainable agriculture, the recommendations given
   by such services must be adapted to local conditions and be provided in
   a timely manner. The AgroTutor mobile application was built to provide
   highly specific and timely agricultural recommendations to farmers
   across Mexico and complement the work of extension agents. At the same
   time, AgroTutor provides direct contributions to the United Nations
   Sustainable Development Goals, either by advancing their implementation
   or providing local data systems to measure and monitor specific
   indicators such as the proportion of agricultural area under productive
   and sustainable agriculture. The application is freely available and
   allows farmers to geo-locate and register plots and the crops grown
   there, using the phone's built-in GPS, or alternatively, on top of very
   high-resolution imagery. Once a crop and some basic data such as
   planting date and cultivar type have been registered, the application
   provides targeted information such as weather, potential and historical
   yield, financial benchmarking information, data-driven recommendations,
   and commodity price forecasts. Farmers are also encouraged to contribute
   in-situ information, e.g., soils, management, and yield data. The
   information can then be used by crop models, which, in turn, send
   tailored results back to the farmers. Initial feedback from farmers and
   extension agents has already improved some of the application's
   characteristics. More enhancements are planned for inclusion in the
   future to increase the application's function as a decision support

Abstract = {{With increasing urbanization, in recent years there has been a growing
   interest and need in monitoring and analyzing urban flood events. Social
   media, as a new data source, can provide real-time information for flood
   monitoring. The social media posts with locations are often referred to
   as Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI), which can reveal the
   spatial pattern of such events. Since more images are shared on social
   media than ever before, recent research focused on the extraction of
   flood-related posts by analyzing images in addition to texts. Apart from
   merely classifying posts as flood relevant or not, more detailed
   information, e.g. the flood severity, can also be extracted based on
   image interpretation. However, it has been less tackled and has not yet
   been applied for flood severity mapping.
   In this paper, we propose a novel three-step process to extract and map
   flood severity information. First, flood relevant images are retrieved
   with the help of pre-trained convolutional neural networks as feature
   extractors. Second, the images containing people are further classified
   into four severity levels by observing the relationship between body
   parts and their partial inundation, i.e. images are classified according
   to the water level with respect to different body parts, namely ankle,
   knee, hip, and chest. Lastly, locations of the Tweets are used for
   generating a map of estimated flood extent and severity. This process
   was applied to an image dataset collected during Hurricane Harvey in
   2017, as a proof of concept. The results show that VGI can be used as a
   supplement to remote sensing observations for flood extent mapping and
   is beneficial, especially for urban areas, where the infrastructure is
   often occluding water. Based on the extracted water level information,
   an integrated overview of flood severity can be provided for the early
   stages of emergency response.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate information of traffic regulators at junctions is important for
   navigating and driving in cities. However, such information is often
   missing, incomplete or not up-to-date in digital maps due to the high
   cost, e.g., time and money, for data acquisition and updating. In this
   study we propose a crowdsourced method that harnesses the light-weight
   GPS tracks from commuting vehicles as Volunteered Geographic Information
   (VGI) for traffic regulator detection. We explore the novel idea of
   detecting traffic regulators by learning the movement patterns of
   vehicles at regulated locations. Vehicles' movement behavior was encoded
   in the form of speed-profiles, where both speed values and their
   sequential order during movement development were used as features in a
   three-class classification problem for the most common traffic
   regulators: traffic-lights, priority-signs and uncontrolled junctions.
   The method provides an average weighting function and a majority voting
   scheme to tolerate the errors in the VGI data. The sequence-to-sequence
   framework requires no extra overhead for data processing, which makes
   the method applicable for real-world traffic regulator detection tasks.
   The results showed that the deep-learning classifier Conditional
   Variational Autoencoder can predict regulators with 90\% accuracy,
   outperforming a random forest classifier (88\% accuracy) that uses the
   summarized statistics of movement as features. In our future work images
   and augmentation techniques can be leveraged to generalize the method's
   ability for classifying a greater variety of traffic regulator classes.}},

Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{To date, little is known about the spatial aspects of the creativity of
   university campuses and their public spaces. This study recognises that
   creativity is the fourth sustainability, because the spatial
   configuration of campuses and city-university accessibilities are
   `creative solutions' conceived for human needs. At the same time,
   creative ideas depend on interactions between individuals and the built
   environment. Therefore, based on the theoretical framework of the
   scholars who have explored the spatial aspects of creativity, this study
   empirically investigates Zernike Campus, Groningen, and its public
   spaces using a mixed-methods approach that involves (1) a space syntax
   analysis of the campus's spatial configuration, (2) volunteered
   geographic information (VGI) of the users' perceptions, and (3)
   non-participatory observations of the interactions between people and
   the built environment in public spaces with high and low `potential for
   creativity'. The results show that creativity cannot be explained simply
   by analysing spatial configurations, but that it also depends on the
   combination of the land-use mix, physical features, positive
   experiences, and perceptions of a sense of place which enable trust and
   interactions, and which facilitate creative encounters. Therefore, the
   mixed-methods approach applied here can help urban planners and
   designers to address public spaces more effectively, integrating
   conditions that support creativity.}},

Abstract = {{A rise in the number of flood-affected people and areas has increased
   the interest in new methods and concepts that account for this change.
   Citizens are integrated into disaster risk reduction processes through
   participatory approaches and can provide valuable up-to-date local
   knowledge. During a field study in Eberbach (Baden-Wuerttemberg,
   Germany) sketch maps and questionnaires were used to capture local
   knowledge about flooding. Based on a previous study on urban flooding in
   Santiago de Chile, the tools were adapted and applied to river flooding
   in the city of Eberbach, which is regularly flooded by the Neckar River,
   a major river in southwest Germany. The empirical database of the study
   comprises 40 participants in the study area and 40 in a control area.
   Half of the participants in each group are residents and half are
   pedestrians. Purposive sampling was used, and the questionnaires aimed
   to gather demographic information and explore what factors, such as
   property, influence the risk perception of the study participants. The
   results show that residents identify a larger spatial area as at risk
   than pedestrians, and owning property leads to higher risk awareness.
   The flood type influenced the choice of the base maps for the sketch
   maps. For river flooding, one map with an overview of the area was
   sufficient, while for urban flooding a second map with more details of
   the area also enables the marking of small streets. The information
   gathered can complement authoritative data such as from flood models.
   This participatory approach also increases the communication and trust
   between local governments, researchers, and citizens.}},

Abstract = {{The majority of spatial data provided as Volunteered Geographic
   Information (VGI) are roads and other linear map features. Such data
   have been widely used in routing and navigation, road network update,

   quality of VGI linear features remains a concern and could seriously

   autocorrelation and semantic correlation of VGI linear feature quality.
   The OpenStreetMap road network of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania (USA)
   was selected as an example to test the proposed framework. Our results
   suggest that the proposed metrics, Box-counting dimension difference and
   Link accuracy are feasible for detecting quality issues and are
   important supplements to the common quality metrics. The findings also
   show that significant spatial autocorrelation exists in spatial
   completeness, positional accuracy, and logical consistency. Road type
   such as Tertiary, Residential, Service and Link has been proven to be a

Abstract = {{The global response to the COVID-19 pandemic has brought with it

   We aimed to explore how social distancing measures affected recreational
   use of urban green space during the partial lockdown in Oslo, Norway.
   Mobile tracking data from thousands of recreationists were used to
   analyze high resolution spatio-temporal changes in activity. We
   estimated that outdoor recreational activity increased by 291\% during
   lockdown relative to a 3 yr average for the same days. This increase was
   significantly greater than expected after adjusting for the prevailing
   weather and time of year and equates to approx. 86 000 extra activities
   per day over the municipality (population of 690 000). Both pedestrians
   (walking, running, hiking) and cyclists appeared to intensify activity
   on trails with higher greenviews and tree canopy cover, but with
   differences in response modulated by trail accessibility and social
   distancing preferences. The magnitude of increase was positively
   associated with trail remoteness, suggesting that green spaces
   facilitated social distancing and indirectly mitigated the spread of
   COVID-19. Finally, pedestrian activity increased in city parks,
   peri-urban forest, as well as protected areas, highlighting the
   importance of access to green open spaces that are interwoven within the
   built-up matrix. These findings shed new light on the value of urban

   initially unknown sets of analysis outcomes. In this paper, we present
   an integrated and component-based approach to privacy-aware
   visualization of VGI, specifically suited for application to natural
   resource management. As a key component, HyperLogLog (HLL)-a data
   abstraction format-is used to allow estimation of results, instead of
   more accurate measurements. While HLL alone cannot preserve privacy, it
   can be combined with existing approaches to improve privacy while, at
   the same time, maintaining some flexibility of analysis. Together, these
   components make it possible to gradually reduce privacy risks for
   volunteers at various steps of the analytical process. A specific use
   case demonstration is provided, based on a global, publicly-available
   dataset that contains 100 million photos shared by 581,099 users under
   Creative Commons licenses. Both the data processing pipeline and
   resulting dataset are made available, allowing transparent benchmarking
   of the privacy-utility tradeoffs.}},

   the Built Environment and Creative Encounters at Dutch University
   Campuses and Science Parks}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{The success of university campuses depends on the interrelations between
   creative encounters and the built environment, conceptualised here as
   spatial affordances for creativity. Such an interface plays a
   fundamental role in interactions for knowledge sharing and the exchange
   of ideas on campus. Due to campus public spaces generally being
   considered as the leftovers between buildings and classrooms,
   undermanaged, and overlooked, little is known about the extent to which
   this built environment enables or inhibits creative encounters in such
   spaces. The inner-city campuses and science parks (SPs) of Amsterdam and
   Utrecht, the case-studies of this research, differ in terms of their
   location relative to the city, their masterplan typologies and the
   arrangement of buildings. However, they are similar in terms of the
   aforementioned issues of public spaces. The novelty of this research is
   the attempt to overcome such issues using an innovative mixed-methods
   approach that tests the `spatial affordances for creativity' with
   empirical data collection and analysis. This raises the importance of
   mapping, quantifying and analysing the spatial distribution of momentary
   perceptions, experiences, and feelings of people with methods such as
   volunteered geographic information (VGI). The results show that
   proximity between multiple urban functions and physical features, such
   as parks, cafes and urban seating are important when it comes to
   explaining the high frequency of creative encounters between people.
   Urban designers of campuses can use the applied method as a tool to plan
   and design attractive public spaces that provide creativity through the
   transfer of tacit knowledge, social well-being, positive momentary
   perceptions, sense of community, and a sense of place.}},

   A Case Study of eBird}},
Journal = {{ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Volunteered geographic information (VGI) has great potential to reveal
   spatial and temporal dynamics of geographic phenomena. However, a
   variety of potential biases in VGI are recognized, many of which root
   from volunteer data contribution activities. Examining patterns in
   volunteer data contribution activities helps understand the biases.
   Using eBird as a case study, this study investigates spatial and
   temporal patterns in data contribution activities of eBird contributors.
   eBird sampling efforts are biased in space and time. Most sampling
   efforts are concentrated in areas of denser populations and/or better
   accessibility, with the most intensively sampled areas being in
   proximity to big cities in developed regions of the world. Reported bird
   species are also spatially biased towards areas where more sampling
   efforts occur. Temporally, eBird sampling efforts and reported bird
   species are increasing over the years, with significant monthly
   fluctuations and notably more data reported on weekends. Such trends are
   driven by the expansion of eBird and characteristics of bird species and
   observers. The fitness of use of VGI should be assessed in the context
   of applications by examining spatial, temporal and other biases. Action
   may need to be taken to account for the biases so that robust inferences

Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{Considering traditional research on social-ecological crises, new social
   media analysis, particularly Twitter data, contributes with
   supplementary exploration techniques. In this article, we argue that a
   social media approach to social-ecological crises can offer an
   actor-centered meaningful perspective on social facts, a depiction of
   the general dynamics of meaning making that takes place among actors,
   and a systemic view of actors' communication before, during and after
   the crisis. On the basis of a multi-technique approach to Twitter data
   (TF-IDF, hierarchical clustering, egocentric networks and principal
   component analysis) applied to a red tide crisis on Chiloe Island,
   Chile, in 2016, the most significant red tide in South America ever, we
   offer a view on the boundaries and dynamics of meaning making in a
   social-ecological crisis. We conclude that this dynamics shows a
   permanent reflexive work on elucidating the causes and effects of the
   crisis that develops according to actors' commitments, the sequence of
   events, and political conveniences. In this vein, social media analysis
   does not replace good qualitative research, it rather opens up
   supplementary possibilities for capturing meanings from the past that
   cannot be retrieved otherwise. This is particularly relevant for
   studying social-ecological crises and supporting collective learning
   processes that point towards increased resilience capacities and more
   sustainable trajectories in affected communities.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED GEOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{123}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Post-disaster recovery involves interdependent processes of physical and
   psychological rehabilitations. Over the past few years, researchers have
   explored geotagged social media data to assist the planning, monitoring,
   and assessment of the post-disaster recovery of tourism destinations,
   given its advantages over traditional approaches. Nonetheless, recent
   studies have mostly focused on quantitatively accessing the physical
   elements of post-disaster recovery (e.g., infrastructure reconstruction
   and re-influx of tourists). Few studies have explored people's
   sentiments and perspectives over the process of post-disaster recovery.
   In this study, a mixed methods approach involving sentiment analysis and
   Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling is designed for mining
   sheer volume of tweets about Lombok and Bali, generated by nonlocal
   Twitter users after a series of earthquakes in the two places in August
   2018. The findings mainly suggest that people have generally become less
   negative about Lombok and Bali over time, despite fluctuations in their
   sentiment polarities' central tendencies. In addition, dissatisfactions
   about the housing reconstruction progress, tourism recovery status, and
   living conditions in the affected areas of Lombok still existed in 2019;
   contestations have been found with regard to the huge funds for hosting
   the 2018 Bali IMF-World Bank meeting after the earthquakes. The overall
   results of this study have proved that the adopted approach can
   effectively reveal the variations of people's sentiments and
   perspectives of general and specific issues regarding post-disaster
   tourism recovery over time.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Restricting mobility is a central aim for lowering contact
   rates and preventing COVID-19 transmission. Yet the impact on mobility
   of different non-pharmaceutical countermeasures in the earlier stages of
   the pandemic is not well-understood.
   Design: Trends were evaluated using Citymapper's mobility index covering
   2nd to 26th March 2020, expressed as percentages of typical usage
   periods from 0\% as the lowest and 100\% as normal. China and India were
   not covered. Multivariate fixed effects models were used to estimate the
   association of policies restricting movement on mobility before and
   after their introduction. Policy restrictions were assessed using the
   Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Stringency Index as well as measures
   coding the timing and degree of school and workplace closures, transport
   restrictions, and cancellation of mass gatherings.
   Setting: 41 cities worldwide.
   Main outcome measures: Citymapper's mobility index.
   Results: Mobility declined in all major cities throughout March. Larger
   declines were seen in European than Asian cities. The COVID-19
   Government Response Stringency Index was strongly associated with
   declines in mobility (r = - 0.75,p < 0.001). After adjusting for
   time-trends, we observed that implementing non-pharmaceutical
   countermeasures was associated with a decline of mobility of 10.0\% for
   school closures (95\% CI: 4.36 to 15.7\%), 15.0\% for workplace closures
   (95\% CI: 10.2 to 19.8\%), 7.09\% for cancelling public events (95\% CI:
   1.98 to 12.2\%), 18.0\% for closing public transport (95\% CI: 6.74 to
   29.2\%), 13.3\% for restricting internal movements (95\% CI: 8.85 to
   17.8\%) and 5.30\% for international travel controls (95\% CI: 1.69 to
   8.90). In contrast, as expected, there was no association between
   population mobility changes and fiscal or monetary measures or emergency
   healthcare investment.
   Conclusions: Understanding the effect of public policy on mobility in
   the early stages is crucial to slowing and reducing COVID-19
   transmission. By using Citymapper's mobility index, this work provides
   the first evidence about trends in mobility and the impacts of different
   policy interventions, suggesting that closure of public transport,
   workplaces and schools are particularly impactful.}},

Volume = {{79}},
Number = {{18}},
Month = {{SEP 10}},
Abstract = {{Earthquakes are one of the destructive natural disasters. Immediate
   emergency response in the first few hours is important for life rescue.
   The near real-time ground deformation maps generated after earthquakes
   are crucial for hazard assessments, which normally take a couple of
   hours or longer to be generated using conventional ways. In this study,
   we propose a near real-time coseismic ground deformation map generation
   system with the aim of assisting rapid seismic hazard evaluations and
   emergency responses. This framework adopts the source parameters
   published by seismological agencies and uses the empirical equations to
   generate the near real-time coseismic ground deformation maps. The
   source parameters of an earthquake, such as the focal mechanism, are
   programmatically accessed from the United States Geological Survey
   National Earthquake Information Center (USGS-NEIC) in a nearly real-time
   manner. The ground deformation estimated using empirical equations is
   integrated as self-adapting spatial data fusion and visualized on an
   interactive WebGIS platform. We develop the WebGIS platform, namely
   QuickDeform at https://www.insar.com.cn, and successfully applied the
   system to several recent large magnitude earthquakes. We find that the
   proposed framework functions robustly and proficiently to automatically
   generate the seismic deformation map within several minutes after the
   occurrence of an earthquake. The generated deformation map shows good
   agreement when compared to the data from real earthquakes. QuickDeform
   can be used as a volunteered geographic information platform for
   crowdsourcing disaster data for rescue and model validation.}},

Abstract = {{Traffic volumes are fundamental for evaluating transportation systems,

   other questions about how and where people bicycle and walk. In recent
   years, researchers and practitioners alike have been using crowdsourced
   data to supplement the non-motorized counts. As such, several methods
   and tools have been developed. The objective of this paper is to take
   advantage of new data sources that provide a limited and biased sample
   of trips and combine them with traditional counts to develop a practical
   tool for estimating annual average daily bicycle (AADB) counts. This
   study developed a direct-demand model for estimating AADB in Texas. Data
   from 100 stations, installed in 12 cities across the state, was used
   together with the crowdsourced Strava, roadway inventory, and American
   Community Survey data to develop the count model for estimating AADB.
   The results indicate that crowdsourced Strava data is an acceptable
   predictor of bicycle counts, and when used with the roadway functional
   class and number of high-income households in a block group, can provide
   quite an accurate AADB estimate (29\% prediction error).}},

Abstract = {{Wildlife species' habitats throughout North America are subject to
   direct and indirect consequences of climate change. Vulnerability
   assessments for the Intermountain West regard wildlife and vegetation
   and their disturbance as two key resource areas in terms of ecosystems
   when considering climate change issues. Despite the adaptability
   potential of certain wildlife, increased temperature estimates of 1.67-2
   degrees C by 2050 increase the likelihood and severity of droughts,
   floods, heatwaves and wildfires in Utah. As a consequence, resilient
   flora and fauna could be displaced. The aim of this study was to locate
   areas of habitat for an exemplary species, i.e., sage-grouse, based on
   current climate conditions and pinpoint areas of future habitat based on
   climate projections. The locations of wildlife were collected from
   Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) observations in addition to
   normal temperature and precipitation, vegetation cover and other
   ecosystem-related data. Four machine learning algorithms were then used
   to locate the current sites of wildlife habitats and predict suitable
   future sites where wildlife would likely relocate to, dependent on the
   effects of climate change and based on a timeframe of scientifically
   backed temperature-increase estimates. Our findings show that Random
   Forest outperforms other competing models, with an accuracy of 0.897,
   and a sensitivity and specificity of 0.917 and 0.885, respectively, and
   has great potential in Species Distribution Modeling (SDM), which can
   provide useful insights into habitat predictions. Based on this model,
   our predictions show that sage-grouse habitats in Utah will continue to
   decrease over the coming years due to climate change, producing a highly
   fragmented habitat and causing a loss of close to 70\% of their current
   habitat. Priority Areas of Conservation (PACs) and protected areas might
   be deemed insufficient to halt this habitat loss, and more effort should
   be put into maintaining connectivity between patches to ensure the
   movement and genetic diversity within the sage-grouse population. The
   underlying data-driven methodical approach of this study could be useful
   for environmentalists, researchers, decision-makers, and policymakers,

   appropriately (e.g., aggregated to areal units (e.g., neighbourhoods) to

   assessing the quality are required, particularly, the explicit linkage
   of data quality and relevant spatial scales, as there are no accepted
   standards or sampling controls. We present a data quality metric, the
   Spatial-comprehensiveness Index (S-COM), which can delineate feasible
   study areas or spatial extents based on the quality of uneven and
   dynamic geographically referenced VGI. This scale-sensitive approach to
   analyzing VGI is demonstrated over different grains with data from two
   citizen science initiatives. The S-COM index can be used both to assess
   feasible study extents based on coverage, user-heterogeneity, and
   density and to find feasible sub-study areas from a larger, indefinite

   various accuracy measures. Both its completeness and diversity patterns
   were then mapped and analyzed in terms of each prefecture-level division

   socioeconomic factors and the number of contributors, higher
   correlations were noted for diversity patterns than completeness
   patterns; thus, the diversity pattern is a better reflection of
   socioeconomic factors and the spatial patterns of contributors. (3) Both
   the completeness and the diversity patterns can be combined to better
   understand an OSM-based LULC dataset. These results indicate that it is
   useful to consider diversity as a supplement for intrinsically assessing
   the quality of an OSM-based LULC dataset. This analytical method can
   also be applied to other countries and regions.}},

Abstract = {{Though Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) has the advantage of
   providing free open spatial data, it is prone to vandalism, which may
   heavily decrease the quality of these data. Therefore, detecting
   vandalism in VGI may constitute a first way of assessing the data in
   order to improve their quality. This article explores the ability of
   supervised machine learning approaches to detect vandalism in
   OpenStreetMap (OSM) in an automated way. For this purpose, our work
   includes the construction of a corpus of vandalism data, given that no
   OSM vandalism corpus is available so far. Then, we investigate the
   ability of random forest methods to detect vandalism on the created
   corpus. Experimental results show that random forest classifiers perform
   well in detecting vandalism in the same geographical regions that were
   used for training the model and has more issues with vandalism detection
   in ``unfamiliar regions{''}.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{83}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Hurricanes are one of the most frequent and destructive disasters in the
   United States. The events are large scale and have relatively long-term
   impacts. Social networking platforms such as Twitter can provide
   real-time information for disaster managers and affected populations
   during large-scale disasters (e.g., hurricanes), but extracting useful
   information and interpreting data accurately for disaster management is
   still challenging. Sentiment analysis of social media data helps detect
   the concerns of affected people and understand individuals' responses on
   the ground at unprecedented scales, but the method is known to be
   domain-dependent. The same words or expressions can indicate opposite
   sentiments in different domains. This paper proposes a domain-specific
   sentiment analysis approach specifically for tweets posted during
   hurricanes (DSSA-H). DSSA-H can retrieve hurricane-relevant tweets with
   a trained supervised-learning classifier, Random Forest (RF), and
   classify the sentiment of hurricane-relevant tweets based on a
   domain-adversarial neural network (DANN). We built a dataset of tweets
   posted during six recent hurricanes and applied the DSSA-H approach for
   sentiment analysis. After evaluation, we found that each classifier
   (i.e., RF and DANN) outperforms baseline classifiers and that DSSA-H
   outperforms two high-performing general sentiment classification
   approaches when classifying sentiments of tweets posted during
   hurricanes. We also applied DSSA-H in examining sentiment patterns
   across six recent hurricanes in the U.S. This domain-specific sentiment
   analysis approach can be used by the first responders and affected
   communities to more accurately and rapidly detect crises and emergent
   events, allocate resources, and assess disaster's impact during
   hurricanes. DSSA-H contributes to an intelligent and adaptive disaster
   information system for the data-rich human and the built environment
   system.}},

Abstract = {{Indigenous knowledge of place is not well-served by today's digital
   geospatial technologies, such as spatial data, maps, spatial databases,

   Indigenous knowledge of place and digital geospatial technologies. Our
   analysis is structured around three key gaps in past work: (a) the
   overrepresentation of digital data about space, rather than knowledge of
   place; (b) a lack of facility to differentiate access to knowledge and
   enable Indigenous data sovereignty; (c) a lack of facility to support
   and sustain relationships between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples.
   The paper further identifies and explores recent research topics in the
   field of geographic information science (GI science) with relevance to
   addressing these gaps. This includes identifying new serendipitous
   synergies with previously unconnected research areas, such as research
   into location privacy, uncertainty, qualitative spatial reasoning, or
   distributed spatial computing. The conclusions acknowledge that our

Abstract = {{Understanding urban spatial pattern of land use is of great significance
   to urban land management and resource allocation. Urban space has strong
   heterogeneity, and thus there were many researches focusing on the
   identification of urban land use. The emergence of multiple new types of
   geospatial data provide an opportunity to investigate the methods of
   mapping essential urban land use. The popularization of street view
   images represented by Baidu Maps is benificial to the rapid acquisition
   of high-precision street view data, which has attracted the attention of
   scholars in the field of urban research. In this study, OpenStreetMap
   (OSM) was used to delineate parcels which were recognized as basic
   mapping units. A semantic segmentation of street view images was
   combined to enrich the multi-dimensional description of urban parcels,
   together with point of interest (POI), Sentinel-2A, and Luojia-1
   nighttime light data. Furthermore, random forest (RF) was applied to
   determine the urban land use categories. The results show that street
   view elements are related to urban land use in the perspective of
   spatial distribution. It is reasonable and feasible to describe urban
   parcels according to the characteristics of street view elements. Due to
   the participation of street view, the overall accuracy reaches 79.13\%.
   The contribution of street view features to the optimal classification

   We instead measured the distance between the location recorded by an

Abstract = {{In this paper we demonstrate a framework for urban flood modeling with
   community mapped data, particularly suited for flood risk management in

   stages: data acquisition with survey design and quality assurance, model
   development and model implementation for flood prediction. We
   demonstrate that data acquisition based on community mapping can be
   affordable, comprehensible, quality assured and open source, making it
   applicable in resource-strained contexts. The framework was demonstrated
   and validated on a case study in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The results
   obtained show that the community mapped data supports flood modeling on
   a level of detail that is currently inaccessible in many data-scarce
   environments. The results obtained also show that the community mapping
   approach is appropriate for datasets that do not require extensive
   training, such as flood extent surveys where it is possible to
   cross-validate the quality of reports given a suitable number and
   density of data points. More technically advanced features such as
   dimensions of urban drainage system elements still require trained
   mappers to create data of sufficient quality. This type of mapping can,
   however, now be performed in new contexts thanks to the development of
   smartphones. Future research is suggested to explore how community

Abstract = {{A landscape generally consists of both natural and human-made elements
   of a land area. Human representations of landscapes can cover a wide
   range of expressions, from figurative paintings to photography and
   natural language expressions. However, the way humans perceive,
   describe, and value a given landscape is still a difficult task to
   address. The research developed in this paper introduces a volunteered
   geographic information (VGI) framework whose objective is to provide an
   interface for an interactive description of a given landscape. A series
   of qualitative and quantitative measures/metrics are developed to
   support such descriptions; they encompass several dimensions such as
   salience, topological and direction relations, solid angle, and
   distance. The framework is evaluated by a series of experiments that
   determine the respective roles of each metric aiming to describe a
   landscape in the VGI environment.}},

Abstract = {{Despite advances in mapping technologies and spatial data capabilities,
   global mapping inequalities are not declining. Inequalities in the
   coverage, quality, and currency of mapping persist, with significant
   gaps in remote and rural parts of the Global South. These regions,
   representing some of the most economically and resource-disadvantaged
   societies in the world, need high-quality mapping to aid in the delivery
   of essential services, such as health care, in response to severe
   challenges such as poverty, conflict, and global climate change.
   Volunteered geographic information (VGI) has shown potential as a
   solution to mapping inequalities. Contributions have largely been made
   in urban areas or in response to acute emergencies (e.g., earthquakes or
   floods), however, leaving rural regions that suffer from chronic
   humanitarian crises undermapped. An alternative solution is needed that
   harnesses the power of volunteer mapping more effectively to address
   regions in most need. Machine learning holds promise. In this article we
   propose centaur VGI, a hybrid system that combines the spatial cognitive
   abilities of human volunteers with the speed and efficiency of a
   machine. We argue that centaur VGI can contribute to mitigating some of
   the political and technological factors that produce inequalities in VGI
   mapping coverage and do so in the context of a case study in Acholi,
   northern Uganda, an inadequately mapped region in which the authors have
   been working since 2017 to provide outreach health care services to
   victims of major limb loss during conflict.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Rights, legal regulations, and practices often arise from societal and
   scientific developments, and societal transformations may originate from
   new legal regulations as well. Basic rights can be re-defined with
   advancements in science and technology. In such an evolutional loop,
   where mutual supply is obvious, combined legal and technological
   frameworks should be exercised and developed for practicing human
   rights. The main aim of this article is to propose a conceptual and
   methodological framework for the improvement of disability rights in the
   light of recent advancements in geographic information science
   (GIScience), in particular for those with motor disabilities, for whom
   questions related to ``where{''} are essential. The concept of
   disability is discussed, considering different aspects, and a new
   methodological framework is proposed in which Geographic Information
   Systems (GIS), volunteered geographic information (VGI) and citizen
   science are at the core. In order to implement the framework at the
   national and international levels, a spatial data model should be
   developed first. The new data collection and interpretation approaches
   based on VGI, citizen science, and machine learning methods may help to
   realize equal rights for people with motor disabilities, by enabling
   improved access to education, health, and travel.}},

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART D-TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{84}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Persistent lack of non-motorized traffic counts can affect the
   evidence-based decisions of transportation planning and safety-concerned
   agencies in making reliable investments in bikeway and other
   non-motorized facilities. Researchers have used various approaches to
   estimate bicycles counts, such as scaling, direct-demand modeling, time
   series, and others. In recent years, an increasing number of studies
   have tried to use crowdsourced data for estimating the bicycle counts.
   Crowdsourced data only represents a small percentage of cyclists. This
   percentage, on the other hand, can change based on the location,
   facility type, meteorological, and other factors. Moreover, the
   autocorrelation observed in bicycle counts may be different from the
   autocorrelation structure observed among crowdsourced platform users,
   such as Strava. Strava users are more consistent; hence, the time series
   count data may be stationary, while bicycle demand may vary based on
   seasonal factors. In addition to seasonal variation, several
   time-invariant contributing factors (e.g., facility type, roadway
   characteristics, household income) affect bicycle demand, which needs to
   be accounted for when developing direct demand models. In this paper, we
   use a mixed-effects model with autocorrelated errors to predict daily
   bicycle counts from crowdsourced data across the state of Texas.
   Additionally, we supplement crowdsourced data with other spatial and
   temporal factors such as roadway facility, household income, population
   demographics, population density and weather conditions to predict
   bicycle counts. The results show that using a robust methodology, we can
   predict bicycle demand with a 29\% margin of error, which is
   significantly lower than merely scaling the crowdsourced data (41\%).}},

Abstract = {{We study the problem of landuse characterization at the urban-object
   level using deep learning algorithms. Traditionally, this task is
   performed by surveys or manual photo interpretation, which are expensive
   and difficult to update regularly. We seek to characterize usages at the
   single object level and to differentiate classes such as educational
   institutes, hospitals and religious places by visual cues contained in
   side-view pictures from Google Street View (GSV). These pictures provide
   geo-referenced information not only about the material composition of
   the objects but also about their actual usage, which otherwise is
   difficult to capture using other classical sources of data such as
   aerial imagery. Since the GSV database is regularly updated, this allows
   to consequently update the landuse maps, at lower costs than those of
   authoritative surveys. Because every urban-object is imaged from a
   number of viewpoints with street-level pictures, we propose a
   deep-learning based architecture that accepts arbitrary number of GSV
   pictures to predict the fine-grained landuse classes at the object
   level. These classes are taken from OpenStreetMap. A quantitative
   evaluation of the area of ile-de-France, France shows that our model
   outperforms other deep learning-based methods, making it a suitable
   alternative to manual landuse characterization.}},

Abstract = {{Unstructured geo-text annotations volunteered by users of web map
   services enrich the basic geographic data. However, irrelevant geo-texts
   can be added to the web map, and these geo-texts reduce utility to
   users. Therefore, this study proposes a method to detect uncorrelated
   geo-text annotations based on Voronoi k-order neighborhood partition and
   auto-correlation statistical models. On the basis of the geo-text
   classification and semantic vector transformation, a quantitative
   description method for spatial autocorrelation was established by the
   Voronoi weighting method of inverse vicinity distance. The Voronoi
   k-order neighborhood self-growth strategy was used to detect the minimum
   convergence neighborhood for spatial autocorrelation. The Pearson method
   was used to calculate the correlation degree of the geo-text in the
   convergence region and then deduce the type of geo-text to be filtered.
   Experimental results showed that for given geo-text types in the study
   region, the proposed method effectively calculated the correlation
   between new geo-texts and the convergence region, providing an effective
   suggestion for preventing uncorrelated geo-text from uploading to the

Abstract = {{The research presented in this paper proposes a thematic network
   approach to explore rich relationships between places. We connect places
   in networks through their thematic similarities by applying topic
   modeling to the textual volunteered geographic information (VGI)
   pertaining to the places. The network approach enhances previous
   research involving place clustering using geo-textual information, which
   often simplifies relationships between places to be either in-cluster or
   out-of-cluster. To demonstrate our approach, we use as a case study in
   Manhattan (New York) that compares networks constructed from three
   different geo-textural data sources-TripAdvisor attraction reviews,
   TripAdvisor restaurant reviews, and Twitter data. The results showcase
   how the thematic similarity network approach enables us to conduct
   clustering analysis as well as node-to-node and node-to-cluster
   analysis, which is fruitful for understanding how places are connected
   through individuals' experiences. Furthermore, by enriching the networks
   with geodemographic information as node attributes, we discovered that
   some low-income communities in Manhattan have distinctive restaurant
   cultures. Even though geolocated tweets are not always related to place
   they are posted from, our case study demonstrates that topic modeling is
   an efficient method to filter out the place-irrelevant tweets and

   Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI), or the Neogeography paradigm.
   Economically, OSM development can be beneficial for governments,
   especially in developing countries such as Iran, where financial support
   is limited. This paper analyzes the spatial pattern, evolution, density,
   and diversity of OSM road (OSMr) networks in Iran between 2008 and 2016
   and looks to find casual relations between the OSM and census
   statistics. This is due to the fact that OSMr completeness reflects the
   importance of OSM data in human life. The diversity of OSM roads further
   reflects the concerns, requirements, and worthiness of clients about
   different roads' information. The results show that the road network in
   Iran considerably increased from 2008 to 2016, with road length
   increasing to 489,400 km in 2016 from 4300 km in 2008. In addition, road
   density grew while road diversity and evenness declined, which could be
   due to an increase in main roads. These results propose a more
   considerable need for a more comprehensive approach using VGI to
   supplement gaps in authoritative data in developing countries.}},

Abstract = {{Social media provides citizens and officials with important sources of
   information during times of crisis. This data article makes available
   labeled, storm-related social media data collected over a six-hour
   period during a severe storm and F1 tornado that struck Central
   Pennsylvania on May 1st, 2017. Three datasets were collected from
   Twitter using location, keyword, and network filtering techniques,
   respectively. Only 2\% of the 22,706 total tweets overlap among the
   datasets, providing researchers with a broader scope of information than
   normally available when collecting tweets using location (i.e.,
   geotag-based) and keyword filtering alone or in combination during a
   crisis. Each data collection technique is described in detail, including
   network filtering which collects data from networks of social media
   users associated with a geographic area.
   The datasets are manually labeled for information content and toponym
   usage. The 22,706 tweet IDs, dehydrated for privacy, are labeled for
   relevance (storm-related and off-topic) and 19 types of storm-related
   information organized into six categories: infrastructure damage,
   service disruption, personal experience, weather updates, weather
   forecasts, and weather warnings. Data are also labeled for toponym usage
   (with or without toponyms), location (local, remote, and generic
   toponyms), and granularity (hyperlocal, municipal, and regional
   toponyms). The comprehensively labeled datasets provide researchers with
   opportunities to analyze crisis-related information behaviors and
   volunteered location information behaviors during a hyperlocal crisis
   event, as well as develop and evaluate automated filtering, geolocation,
   and event detection techniques that can aid citizens and crisis
   responders. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Title = {{Defining and spatially modelling cultural ecosystem services using

Journal = {{ECOSYSTEM SERVICES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{43}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Cultural ecosystem services (CES) are some of the most valuable
   contributions of ecosystems to human well-being. Nevertheless, these
   services are often underrepresented in ecosystem service assessments.
   Defining CES for the purposes of spatial quantification has been
   challenging because it has been difficult to spatially model CES.
   However, rapid increases in mobile network connectivity and the use of
   social media have generated huge amounts of crowdsourced data. This
   offers an opportunity to define and spatially quantify CES. We
   inventoried established CES conceptualisations and sources of
   crowdsourced data to propose a CES definition and typology for spatial
   quantification. Furthermore, we present the results of three spatial
   models employing crowdsourced data to measure CES on Texel, a coastal
   island in the Netherlands. Defining CES as information-flows best
   enables service quantification. A general typology of eight services is
   proposed. The spatial models produced distributions consistent with
   known areas of cultural importance on Texel. However, user
   representativeness and measurement uncertainties affect our results.
   Ethical considerations must also be taken into account. Still,
   crowdsourced data is a valuable source of information to define and
   model CES due to the level of detail available. This can encourage the
   representation of CES in ecosystem service assessments.}},

Journal = {{SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{28}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Developing countries have ineffective and outdated land administration
   systems (LAS) which make it a challenge to properly register, manage and
   secure tenure for local communities. Moreover, limited maintenance
   budgets prevalent in these countries make it difficult for organizations
   to conduct regular systematic updates of geographic information. For a
   LAS to remain useful, it must reflect realities on the ground, and this
   can only be achieved if land information is reported regularly. However,
   if changes in the land are not captured in properly administered land
   registers, LAS lose societal relevance and are eventually replaced by
   informal systems. Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) can address
   these challenges by providing a timely, affordable, flexible, inclusive,
   up-to-date, and fit for purpose land information to support the limited
   current systems. However, the consideration and integration of such
   external sources relies on the quality and credibility of contributed
   datasets by the public. The public whom in most cases are non-geographic
   experts can contribute datasets of varying quality and detail, resulting
   in the reluctance of officials to utilize VGI in their databases.
   Therefore, this study proposes a Kappa statistical measure methodology:
   a consensus-based measure of agreement to establish `proxy' quality and
   credibility of VGI. The methodology was successfully implemented in a
   case study of Botswana to demonstrate its effectiveness in establishing
   trust and confidence of contributed datasets by the public. The
   innovative approach to Kappa presented here, minimizes the need for
   ground truthing of VGI data.}},

Abstract = {{Upgrading slum settlements has been a priority for President Joko Widodo
   since he took office in 2014. The government's national slum-upgrading
   programme, announced in 2015, aims to provide access to clean water,
   sanitation, and better housing in at least 38,000 ha of slums across
   Indonesian cities. Data collection for this project currently involves
   using paper forms to complete neighbourhood and household surveys in
   slums to develop baseline data. Aside from the laborious processing
   involved, paper-based survey data also lack positional accuracy and
   comprehensive information and cannot be integrated with community and
   government data. Ineffective data collection and mapping hinders the
   optimum use of slum baseline data. Improving data accuracy and tool
   usability is essential for effective and efficient programme
   implementation. This research utilised a digital survey app known as ODK
   and collaborative mapping to validate the results of surveys in the
   slums in Yogyakarta, Palu, and Malang. Field survey results were plotted
   into the following three different mapping platforms: a combination of
   Google Fusion Tables and Google Maps API for Yogyakarta, storytelling
   maps with ArcGIS Online for Palu, and OpenLayers API for Malang.
   Usability interviews revealed that community facilitators agreed on the
   effectiveness, efficiency, learnability, and utility of the digital

Abstract = {{Volunteered geographic information can be used to predict regional
   desirability. A common challenge regarding previous works is that
   intuitive empirical models, which are inaccurate and bring in perceptual
   bias, are traditionally used to predict regional desirability. This
   results from the fact that the hidden interactions between user online
   check-ins and regional desirability have not been revealed and clearly
   modelled yet. To solve the problem, a novel neural network model
   `RegNet' is proposed. The user check-in history is input into a neural
   network encoder structure firstly for redundancy reduction and feature
   learning. The encoded representation is then fed into a hidden-layer
   structure and the regional desirability is predicted. The proposed
   RegNet is data-driven and can adaptively model the unknown mappings from
   input to output, without presumed bias and prior knowledge. We conduct
   experiments with real-world datasets and demonstrate RegNet outperforms
   state-of-the-art methods in terms of ranking quality and prediction
   accuracy of rating. Additionally, we also examine how the structure of
   encoder affects RegNet performance and suggest on choosing proper sizes
   of encoded representation. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of
   data-driven methods in modelling the hidden unknown relationships and
   achieving a better performance over traditional empirical methods.}},

Abstract = {{With the recent rise of open government and open data initiatives,
   governments are increasingly adopting new approaches of citizen
   participation to support a more democratic, transparent, and inclusive
   government system. Among other forms of citizen participation,
   Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) is one approach to connecting
   citizens and government. Accepting VGI as a way to update government
   data or collect near-real-time information from citizens can create a
   partner-like relationship where citizens voluntarily contribute time and
   effort to support government actions. However, as a relatively new
   approach to citizen participation and data collection, VGI requires
   evaluation from the perspective of governments. This research
   investigates the challenges and opportunities that governments have
   found through the implementation of VGI projects. Results are drawn from
   interviews conducted with 19 government organizations, revealing
   organizational and technical challenges that limit the adoption of VGI.
   Organizational challenges are associated with government mindset,
   implementation, and project management, while technical challenges
   involve development of the system and quality of data. Given these

Abstract = {{Are nearby places (e.g., cities) described by related words? In this
   article, we transfer this research question in the field of lexical
   encoding of geographic information onto the level of intertextuality. To
   this end, we explore Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) to model
   texts addressing places at the level of cities or regions with the help
   of so-called topic networks. This is done to examine how language
   encodes and networks geographic information on the aboutness level of
   texts. Our hypothesis is that the networked thematizations of places are
   similar, regardless of their distances and the underlying communities of
   authors. To investigate this, we introduce Multiplex Topic Networks
   (MTN), which we automatically derive from Linguistic Multilayer Networks
   (LMN) as a novel model, especially of thematic networking in text
   corpora. Our study shows a Zipfian organization of the thematic universe
   in which geographical places (especially cities) are located in online
   communication. We interpret this finding in the context of cognitive
   maps, a notion which we extend by so-called thematic maps. According to
   our interpretation of this finding, the organization of thematic maps as
   part of cognitive maps results from a tendency of authors to generate
   shareable content that ensures the continued existence of the underlying
   media. We test our hypothesis by example of special wikis and extracts
   of Wikipedia. In this way, we come to the conclusion that geographical
   places, whether close to each other or not, are located in neighboring
   semantic places that span similar subnetworks in the topic universe.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Social media (SM) can be an invaluable resource in terms of
   understanding and managing the effects of catastrophic disasters. In
   order to use SM platforms for public participatory (PP) mapping of
   emergency management activities, a bias investigation should be
   undertaken with regard to the data related to the study area (urban,
   regional or national, etc.) to determine the spatial data dynamics.
   Thus, such determinations can be made on how SM can be used and
   interpreted in terms of PP. In this study, the city of Istanbul was
   chosen for social media data research area, as it is one of the most
   crowded cities in the world and expecting a major earthquake. The
   methodology for the data investigation is: 1. Obtain data and engage
   sampling, 2. Identify the representation and temporal biases in the data
   and normalize it in response to representation bias, 3. Identify general
   anomalies and spatial anomalies, 4. Manipulate the trend of the dataset
   with the discretization of anomalies and 5. Examine the spatiotemporal
   bias. Using this bias investigation methodology, citizen footprint
   dynamics in the city were determined and reference maps (most likely
   regional anomaly maps, representation maps, time-space bias maps, etc.)
   were produced. The outcomes of the study can be summarized in four
   steps. First, highly active users generate the majority of the data and
   removing this data as a general approach within a pseudo-cleaning
   process means concealing a large amount of data. Second, data
   normalization in terms of activity levels, changes the anomaly outcome
   resulting from diverse representation levels of users. Third,
   spatiotemporally normalized data present strong spatial anomaly tendency
   in some parts of the central area. Fourth, trend data is dense in the
   central area and the spatiotemporal bias assessments show the data
   density varies in terms of the time of day, day of week and season of
   the year. The methodology proposed in this study can be used to extract
   the unbiased daily routines of the social media data of the regions for
   the normal days and this can be referred for the emergency or unexpected
   event cases to detect the change or impacts.}},

Journal = {{ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The data generated by social media such as Twitter are classified as big
   data and the usability of those data can provide a wide range of
   resources to various study areas including disaster management, tourism,
   political science, and health. However, apart from the acquisition of
   the data, the reliability and accuracy when it comes to using it concern
   scientists in terms of whether or not the use of social media data (SMD)
   can lead to incorrect and unreliable inferences. There have been many
   studies on the analyses of SMD in order to investigate their
   reliability, accuracy, or credibility, but that have not dealt with the
   filtering techniques applied to with the data before creating the
   results or after their acquisition. This study provides a methodology
   for detecting the accuracy and reliability of the filtering techniques
   for SMD and then a spatial similarity index that analyzes spatial
   intersections, proximity, and size, and compares them. Finally, we offer
   a comparison that shows the best combination of filtering techniques and
   similarity indices to create event maps of SMD by using the Getis-Ord
   Gi{*} technique. The steps of this study can be summarized as follows:
   an investigation of domain-based text filtering techniques for dealing
   with sentiment lexicons, machine learning -based sentiment analyses on
   reliability, and developing intermediate codes specific to domain-based
   studies; then, by using various similarity indices, the determination of
   the spatial reliability and accuracy of maps of the filtered social
   media data. The study offers the best combination of filtering, mapping,
   and spatial accuracy investigation methods for social media data,
   especially in the case of emergencies, where urgent spatial information
   is required. As a result, a new similarity index based on the spatial
   intersection, spatial size, and proximity relationships is introduced to
   determine the spatial accuracy of the fine-filtered SMD. The motivation
   for this research is to develop the ability to create an incidence map
   shortly after a disaster event such as a bombing. However, the proposed
   methodology can also be used for various domains such as concerts,
   elections, natural disasters, marketing, etc.}},

Abstract = {{User-generated map data is increasingly used by the technology industry
   for background mapping, navigation and beyond. An example is the
   integration of OpenStreetMap (OSM) data in widely-used smartphone and
   web applications, such as Pokemon GO (PGO), a popular augmented reality
   smartphone game. As a result of OSM's increased popularity, the
   worldwide audience that uses OSM through external applications is
   directly exposed to malicious edits which represent cartographic
   vandalism. Multiple reports of obscene and anti-semitic vandalism in OSM
   have surfaced in popular media over the years. These negative news
   related to cartographic vandalism undermine the credibility of
   collaboratively generated maps. Similarly, commercial map providers
   (e.g., Google Maps and Waze) are also prone to carto-vandalism through
   their crowdsourcing mechanism that they may use to keep their map
   products up-to-date. Using PGO as an example, this research analyzes
   harmful edits in OSM that originate from PGO players. More specifically,
   this paper analyzes the spatial, temporal and semantic characteristics
   of PGO carto-vandalism and discusses how the mapping community handles
   it. Our findings indicate that most harmful edits are quickly discovered
   and that the community becomes faster at detecting and fixing these
   harmful edits over time. Gaming related carto-vandalism in OSM was found
   to be a short-term, sporadic activity by individuals, whereas the task
   of fixing vandalism is persistently pursued by a dedicated user group
   within the OSM community. The characteristics of carto-vandalism
   identified in this research can be used to improve vandalism detection
   systems in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Greece is one of the few European countries that has not yet a fully
   operating Cadastre at national coverage. Cadastral surveying and
   property registration have been completed only for about 8\% of the
   Greek territory, which includes about 18\% of the total property rights.
   At the remaining areas, cadastral surveying and property registration is
   still under development and is expected to be completed by the end of
   2021. The cadastral survey is a participatory procedure in which
   property right holders, or their representatives, are expected to
   declare the land parcels on which they have property rights and submit
   all documents that prove these rights. The time frame available for the
   declaration is 3 months, which is specific for each municipality. Right
   holders are now enabled to provide both spatial and descriptive
   information, regarding their properties and property rights, without the
   need of a professional. That includes the parcel's boundary lines along
   with the legal documents required to validate the declaration. Each
   right holder, or a representative, has the option to submit a
   declaration over the internet through a web application without the need
   of a professional. Within the frame of a PhD research, several concerns
   were addressed such as usability, security, and scalability in order for
   the outcome to support its scope while respecting binding constrains. As
   a result, two web applications have been created to officially support
   the Hellenic Cadaster property rights declaration process. The suggested
   approach was considered a big success in terms of both public acceptance
   and usability as shown from the statistics collected during the first
   eight months of its formal operation.}},

Abstract = {{Land use and land cover (LULC) mapping is often undertaken by national
   mapping agencies, where these LULC products are used for different types
   of monitoring and reporting applications. Updating of LULC databases is
   often done on a multi-year cycle due to the high costs involved, so
   changes are only detected when mapping exercises are repeated.
   Consequently, the information on LULC can quickly become outdated and
   hence may be incorrect in some areas. In the current era of big data and
   Earth observation, change detection algorithms can be used to identify
   changes in urban areas, which can then be used to automatically update
   LULC databases on a more continuous basis. However, the change detection
   algorithm must be validated before the changes can be committed to
   authoritative databases such as those produced by national mapping
   agencies. This paper outlines a change detection algorithm for
   identifying construction sites, which represent ongoing changes in LU,
   developed in the framework of the LandSense project. We then use
   volunteered geographic information (VGI) captured through the use of
   mapathons from a range of different groups of contributors to validate
   these changes. In total, 105 contributors were involved in the
   mapathons, producing a total of 2778 observations. The 105 contributors
   were grouped according to six different user-profiles and were analyzed
   to understand the impact of the experience of the users on the accuracy
   assessment. Overall, the results show that the change detection
   algorithm is able to identify changes in residential land use to an
   adequate level of accuracy (85\%) but changes in infrastructure and
   industrial sites had lower accuracies (57\% and 75 \%, respectively),
   requiring further improvements. In terms of user profiles, the experts
   in LULC from local authorities, researchers in LULC at the French
   national mapping agency (IGN), and first-year students with a basic
   knowledge of geographic information systems had the highest overall
   accuracies (86.2\%, 93.2\%, and 85.2\%, respectively). Differences in
   how the users approach the task also emerged, e.g., local authorities
   used knowledge and context to try to identify types of change while
   those with no knowledge of LULC (i.e., normal citizens) were quicker to
   choose `Unknown' when the visual interpretation of a class was more
   difficult.}},

Abstract = {{Missing data in Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) are an
   unavoidable consequence of data collection by non-experts, guided by
   only vague and informal mapping guidelines. While various Missing Value
   Imputation (MVI) techniques have been proposed as data cleansing
   strategies, they have primarily targeted numerical data attributes in
   non-spatial databases. There remains a significant gap in methods for
   imputing nominal attribute values (e.g., Street Name) in map databases.
   Here, we present an imputation algorithm called the Membership
   Imputation Algorithm (MIA), targeting spatial databases and enabling
   imputation of nominal values in spatially referenced records. By
   targeting membership classes of spatial objects, MIA harnesses
   spatio-temporal characteristics of data and proposes efficient
   heuristics to impute the class name (i.e., a membership). Experimental
   results show that the proposed algorithm is able to impute the
   membership with high levels of accuracy (over 94\%) when assigning
   Street Name(s), across highly diverse regional contexts. MIA is
   effective in challenging spatial contexts such as street intersections.
   Our research serves as a first step in highlighting the effectiveness of
   spatio-temporal measures as a key driver for nominal imputation
   techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Cities are complex systems connected to economic, ecological, and
   demographic conditions and change. They are also characterized by
   diverging perceptions and interests of citizens and stakeholders. Thus,
   in the arena of urban planning, we are in need of approaches that are
   able to cope not only with urban complexity but also allow for
   participatory and collaborative processes to empower citizens. This to
   create democratic cities. Connected to the field of smart cities and
   citizens, we present in this paper, the prototype of an urban digital
   twin for the 30,000-people town of Herrenberg in Germany. Urban digital
   twins are sophisticated data models allowing for collaborative
   processes. The herein presented prototype comprises (1) a 3D model of
   the built environment, (2) a street network model using the theory and
   method of space syntax, (3) an urban mobility simulation, (4) a wind
   flow simulation, and (5) a number of empirical quantitative and
   qualitative data using volunteered geographic information (VGI). In
   addition, the urban digital twin was implemented in a visualization
   platform for virtual reality and was presented to the general public
   during diverse public participatory processes, as well as in the
   framework of the ``Morgenstadt Werkstatt{''} (Tomorrow's Cities
   Workshop). The results of a survey indicated that this method and
   technology could significantly aid in participatory and collaborative
   processes. Further understanding of how urban digital twins support
   urban planners, urban designers, and the general public as a
   collaboration and communication tool and for decision support allows us
   to be more intentional when creating smart cities and sustainable cities
   with the help of digital twins. We conclude the paper with a discussion
   of the presented results and further research directions.}},

Title = {{Estimation of Wastewater Discharges by Means of OpenStreetMap Data}},
Journal = {{WATER}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{For the optimization of sewer networks and integration of water
   management in urban planning, estimations of wastewater discharges at a
   high spatial resolution are a key boundary condition. In many cases,
   these data are not available or, for reasons of data protection and
   company secrecy, the data are not accessible for research purposes.
   Therefore, procedures are needed to determine the volume of wastewater
   with high spatial resolution, based on freely accessible data. The
   approach presented here uses mainly OpenStreetMap (OSM) data, combined
   with a dataset of the German official topographic-cartographic
   Information System (ATKIS), to estimate the volume of wastewater on a
   building level. By comparison with daily values of the dry weather
   inflow at pumping stations and sewage treatment plants, it is shown that
   the method can generate realistic results, if target inflows exceed 50
   m(3)/d. Difficulties due to the effect of commuting and the individual
   use of the buildings have to be considered, as well as data-quality
   issues in the OSM dataset. As an application example, the generated
   wastewater discharges are spatially joined with land-use plans. The
   resulting wastewater yield factors serve as input data for
   decision-support tools in urban water planning or modeling tasks.}},

Journal = {{HEALTH \& PLACE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{62}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Health researchers and policy-makers increasingly use volunteered
   geographic information (VGI) to analyze spatial variation in health and
   wellbeing and to develop interventions. As socially constructed data,
   health VGI reflect the people who perceive issues and choose to report
   them, and the digital systems that structure the reporting process. We
   propose a conceptual framework that describes the interlocking effects
   of socioeconomic, behavioral, geographic, and technological processes on
   VGI accuracy and credibility. GIS and statistical methods are used to
   analyze social and geographical biases in health-related VGI through a
   case study of bed bug complaint data from New York City's 311 system.
   Reports of bed bug infestation from 311 are mapped and modeled to
   uncover associations with socioeconomic and built environment
   characteristics. Factors associated with bed bug report credibility are
   examined by comparing characteristics of confirmed reports with those
   for reports in which inspectors found no evidence of infestation
   (negative reports). A multilevel model of credibility incorporating
   report-, building-, and tract-level variables reveals strong
   geographical and socioeconomic biases, with negative reports generated
   more frequently from high-value residential buildings located in
   high-income neighborhoods with predominately white, non-Hispanic
   populations. Using 311 data for all bed bug reports, rather than
   confirmed reports, obscures the burden of these pests in high poverty
   neighborhoods and diminishes socioeconomic disparities. Mistaken
   reporting also has economic costs, as each report triggers an inspection
   by city inspectors that entails time, monetary, and opportunity costs.}},

   100,000 visitors, tourists' images focused on landscapes (54\%) or
   biodiversity (50\%), with fewer images including tourists (23\%), mainly

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results from a quality and usability analysis of
   participatory land registration (PaLaR) in Indonesia's rural areas,
   focusing on data quality, cost, and time. PaLaR was designed as a
   systematic community-centered land titling project collecting requisite
   spatial and legal data. PaLaR was piloted in two communities situated in
   Tanggamus and Grobogan districts in Indonesia. The research compared
   spatial data accuracy between two approaches, PaLaR and the normal
   systematic land registration approach (PTSL) with respect to point
   accuracy and polygon area. Supplementary observations and interviews
   were undertaken in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the spatial
   and legal data collection, as well as logical consistency of the data
   collected by the community committee, using a mobile application.
   Although the two pilots showed a lower spatial accuracy than the normal
   method (PTSL), PaLaR better suited local circumstances and still
   delivered complete spatial and legal data in a more effective means. The
   accuracy and efficiency of spatial data collection could be improved
   through the use of more accurate GNSS antennas and a seamless connection

   What are the motivations behind this mapping endeavor? We analyze

Journal = {{GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{21}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Owing to the huge number of species observations that can be collected
   by nonprofessional scientists, ``citizen science{''} has great potential
   to contribute to scientific knowledge on invasive alien species (IAS).
   Citizen science has existed for centuries, but the recent adoption of
   information and communications technology (ICT) in this field (e.g. web-
   or mobile application-based interfaces for citizen training and data
   generation) has led to a massive surge in popularity, mainly due to
   reduced geographic barriers to citizen participation. Several challenges
   exist, however, to effectively utilize citizen-generated data for
   monitoring IAS (or other species of interest) at the global scale. Here,
   we conducted a systematic analysis of citizen science initiatives
   collecting IAS data using ICT, hoping to better understand their
   scientific contributions and challenges, their similarities/differences,
   and their interconnections. Through a search of the Scopus database, we
   identified 26 initiatives whose data had been used in scientific
   publications related to IAS, and based our analyses on these
   initiatives. The most common scientific uses of these citizen science
   data were to visualize the spatial distribution of IAS, better
   understand their behaviour/phenology, and elucidate citizen science data
   quality issues. To alleviate data quality concerns, most initiatives
   (19/26) had mechanisms for verifying citizen observations, such as
   user-submitted photographs. While many initiatives collected similar
   data parameters for each species observation, only 54\% of the
   initiatives had a practice of data sharing. This lack of data sharing
   causes fragmentation of the citizen-generated IAS data, and is likely
   inhibiting the wider usage of the data for scientific studies on IAS
   involving large geographic scales (e.g. regional or global) and/or broad
   taxonomic scopes. To reduce this fragmentation and better consolidate
   the collected citizen science data, finally we provide some general data
   sharing guidelines for citizen science initiatives as well as individual
   volunteers. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Marine Volunteered Geographic Information (informally ``crowdsourced

   the official chart has been rare, mainly due to lack of calibration and
   other metadata that would satisfy liability concerns. As an alternative
   to these ideas, a data collection system is proposed which, by design,
   can auto-calibrate and provide other data quality guarantees, and
   thereby generate data that by construction should be qualified for
   hydrographic use. This idea is termed here Trusted Community Bathymetry
   (TCB). A design for such a system is outlined, and its performance
   demonstrated experimentally through a prototype system based on a
   low-cost, post-processed GNSS receiver and NMEA data logger. By
   comparison against NGS control and survey-grade GNSS equipment, it is
   shown that the TCB system achieves centimeter to decimeter-level
   positioning in 3D, auto-calibrates vertical offsets to the sonar
   transducer within a decimeter, and provides realtime uncertainty
   estimates for ellipsoid-referenced soundings. Additionally, in an

Abstract = {{Location-based games have become popular in recent years, with Pokemon
   Go and Ingress being two very prominent examples. Some location-based
   games, known as Serious Games, go beyond entertainment and serve
   additional purposes such as data collection. Such games are also found
   in the OpenStreetMap context and playfully enrich the project's
   geodatabase. Examples include Kort and StreetComplete. This article
   examines the role of spatially structured scoring systems as a
   motivational element. It is analysed how spatial structure in scoring
   systems is correlated with changes observed in the game behaviour. For
   this purpose, our study included two groups of subjects who played a
   modified game based on StreetComplete in a real urban environment. One
   group played the game with a spatially structured scoring system and the
   other with a spatially random scoring system. We evaluated different
   indicators and analysed the players' GPS trajectories. In addition, the
   players filled out questionnaires to investigate whether they had become
   aware of the scoring system they were playing. The results obtained show
   that players who are confronted with a spatially structured scoring
   system are more likely to be in areas with high scores, have a longer
   playing time, walk longer distances and are more willing to take
   detours. Furthermore, discrepancies between the perception of a possible
   system in the scoring system and corresponding actions were revealed.
   The results are informative for game design, but also for a better
   understanding of how players interact with their geographical context
   during location-based games.}},

Abstract = {{Many people use smartphone cameras to record their living environments
   through captured images, and share aspects of their daily lives on
   social networks, such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. These
   platforms provide volunteered geographic information (VGI), which
   enables the public to know where and when events occur. At the same
   time, image-based VGI can also indicate environmental changes and
   disaster conditions, such as flooding ranges and relative water levels.
   However, little image-based VGI has been applied for the quantification
   of flooding water levels because of the difficulty of identifying water
   lines in image-based VGI and linking them to detailed terrain models. In
   this study, flood detection has been achieved through image-based VGI
   obtained by smartphone cameras. Digital image processing and a
   photogrammetric method were presented to determine the water levels. In
   digital image processing, the random forest classification was applied
   to simplify ambient complexity and highlight certain aspects of flooding
   regions, and the HT-Canny method was used to detect the flooding line of
   the classified image-based VGI. Through the photogrammetric method and a
   fine-resolution digital elevation model based on the unmanned aerial
   vehicle mapping technique, the detected flooding lines were employed to
   determine water levels. Based on the results of image-based VGI
   experiments, the proposed approach identified water levels during an
   urban flood event in Taipei City for demonstration. Notably, classified
   images were produced using random forest supervised classification for a
   total of three classes with an average overall accuracy of 88.05\%. The
   quantified water levels with a resolution of centimeters (<3-cm
   difference on average) can validate flood modeling so as to extend
   point-basis observations to area-basis estimations. Therefore, the
   limited performance of image-based VGI quantification has been improved
   to help in flood disasters. Consequently, the proposed approach using
   VGI images provides a reliable and effective flood-monitoring technique
   for disaster management authorities.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an end-to-end methodology that can be used in the

   deep learning process which enables a helicopter landing site analysis
   through the identification of soccer fields. The method trains a deep
   learning autoencoder with the help of volunteered geographic information
   and satellite images. The process is mostly automated, it was developed
   to be applied in a time- and resource-constrained environment and keeps
   the human factor in the loop in order to control the final decisions. We
   show that through this process the cognitive load (CL) for an expert
   image analyst will be reduced by 70\%, while the process will
   successfully identify 85.6\% of the potential landing sites. We conclude
   that the suggested methodology can be used as part of a disaster

Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The paper proposes a transparent approach for mapping the status of
   environmental phenomena from multisource information based on both soft
   computing and machine learning. It is transparent, intended as human
   understandable as far as the employed criteria, and both knowledge and
   data-driven. It exploits remote sensing experts' interpretations to
   define the contributing factors from which partial evidence of the
   environmental status are computed by processing multispectral images.
   Furthermore, it computes an environmental status indicator (ESI) map by
   aggregating the partial evidence degrees through a learning mechanism,
   exploiting volunteered geographic information (VGI). The approach is
   capable of capturing the specificities of local context, as well as to
   cope with the subjectivity of experts' interpretations. The proposal is
   applied to map the status of standing water areas (i.e., water bodies
   and rivers and human-driven or natural hazard flooding) using
   multispectral optical images by ESA Sentinel-2 sources. VGI comprises
   georeferenced observations created both in situ by agronomists using a
   mobile application and by photointerpreters interacting with a
   geographic information system (GIS) using several information layers.
   Results of the validation experiments were performed in three areas of
   Northern Italy characterized by distinct ecosystems. The proposal showed
   better performances than traditional methods based on single spectral

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{There is an ongoing discussion about the applicability of social media
   data in scientific research. Moreover, little is known about the
   feasibility to use these data to capture Quality-of-Life (QoL). This
   study explores the use of social media in QoL research by capturing and
   mapping people's perceptions about their life based on geo-located
   Twitter data. The methodology is based on a mixed-method approach,
   combining manual coding of the messages, automated classification, and
   spatial analysis. Bristol is used as a case study, with a dataset
   containing 1,374,706 geotagged Tweets. Based on the manual coding
   results, three QoL domains were analysed. Results show the difference
   between Bristol wards in number and type of QoL perceptions in every
   domain, spatial distribution of positive and negative perceptions, and
   differences between the domains. Furthermore, results from this study
   are compared to the official QoL survey results from Bristol,
   statistically and spatially. Overall, three main conclusions are
   underlined. First, to an extent, Twitter data can be used to evaluate
   QoL. Second, based on people's perceptions, there is a difference in QoL
   between neighbourhoods in Bristol. And, third, Twitter messages can be
   used to complement QoL surveys, but not act as a proxy for traditional
   survey results. The main contribution of this study is in recognising
   the potential Twitter data have in QoL research. This potential lies in
   producing additional knowledge about QoL that can be placed in a
   planning context and effectively used to improve the decision-making
   process and enhance quality-of-life of residents.}},

   importance of different land use categories. Finally, we show that using
   OSM's granular point of interest data allows for better predictions than
   the broader categories typically used in studies of transportation and

Abstract = {{ABSTARCT With rapid growth in bicycling, timely and spatially rich
   bicycling infrastructure data are essential for understanding
   determinants of ridership, equity of access, and potential for future
   developments. OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a collaborative global map that was
   built by volunteers and is promising for active transportation research.
   In this article, we use OSM to inventory bicycling infrastructure in six
   Canadian cities, compare it to municipal open data, and provide guidance
   for practitioners using OSM data. We conducted an evaluation of OSM and
   open data, overall and for four categories of bicycle infrastructure:
   cycle tracks; on-street bicycle lanes; paths (bicycle only or multiuse);
   and local street bikeways. We found that the concordance in terms of
   total length of OSM infrastructure to open data infrastructure very high
   in two of the six cities (< +/- 2\%), and reasonably high in all cities
   (maximum difference +/- 30\%). Concordance for infrastructure categories
   was highest for on-street bicycle lanes, which were the most common, and
   easily identifiable type of bicycle infrastructure in the OSM data, and
   lowest for cycle tracks and local street bikeways, both of which are new
   or relatively rare infrastructure types in some Canadian cities. In some
   cases, OSM was more detailed and timely than open data. A challenge in
   OSM is consistent tagging of bicycle infrastructure types. We encourage
   practitioners to consider OSM data for multicity studies, but to be
   mindful of potential inconsistencies in attribution and local
   definitions. We also recommend users of OSM to publish data queries for
   repeatability.}},

   The analyzes reflect three different periods (until 1997, between 1998

   creation of Brazilian National SDI (in 2008) had an impact on the

   coverage of this reference data. One of them is the use of new data
   sources such as Volunteered Geographic Information, especially in areas
   with outdated mapping or without mapping, as has already been used in

Pages = {{45-58}},
Abstract = {{Investigating perceived air quality (AQ) in urban areas is a rather new
   topic of interest. Papers presenting results from studies on perception
   of AQ have thus far focused on the individual characteristics leading to
   a certain AQ perception or have compared personal perception with
   on-site measurements. Here we present a novel approach, namely applying
   volunteered geographic information (VGI) technologies in urban AQ
   monitoring. We present two smartphone applications that have been
   developed and applied in two EU projects (FP7 CITI-SENSE and H2020
   hackAIR) to obtain citizens' perception of AQ. We focus on observations
   reported through the smartphone apps for the greater Oslo area in
   Norway. In order to evaluate whether the reports on perceived AQ contain
   information about the actual spatial patterns of AQ, we carried out a
   comparison of the perception data against the output from the
   high-resolution urban AQ model EPISODE. The results indicate an
   association between modelled annual average pollutant concentrations and
   the provided perception reports. This demonstrates that the spatial
   patterns of perceived AQ are not entirely random but follow to some
   extent what would be expected due to proximity of emission sources and
   transport. This information shows that VGI about citizens' perception of
   AQ has the potential to identify areas with low environmental quality

   images supported by the road vector. After that, a superpixel method is
   applied to improve the road areas by fusing the superpixels with the
   previous results. Experiments are performed on the satellite images from

Abstract = {{Urban areas tend to be warmer than their rural surroundings, well-known
   as the ``urban heat island{''} effect. Higher nocturnal air temperature
   (T-air) is associated with adverse effects on human health, higher
   mortality rates, and higher energy consumption. Prediction of the
   spatial distribution of T-air is a step toward the ``Smart City{''}
   concept, providing an early warning system for vulnerable populations.
   The study of the spatial distribution of urban T-air was thus far
   limited by the low spatial resolution of traditional data sources.
   Volunteered geographic information provides alternative data with higher
   spatial density, with citizen weather stations monitoring T-air
   continuously in hundreds or thousands of locations within a single city.
   In this article, the aim was to predict the spatial distribution of
   nocturnal T-air in Berlin, Germany, one day in advance at a 30-m
   resolution using open-source remote sensing and geodata from Landsat and
   Urban Atlas, crowdsourced T-air data, and machine learning (ML) methods.
   Results were tested with a ``leave-one-date-out{''} training scheme

   algorithms were compared-Random Forest (RF), Stochastic Gradient

   error (RMSE) for testing(crowd) of 1.16 degrees C (R-2 = 0.512) and RMSE
   for testing(ref) of 1.97 degrees C (R-2 = 0.581). Overall, the most

   morphometric parameters and albedo. The proposed method relies on
   open-source datasets and can, therefore, be adapted to many cities

Year = {{2020}},
Number = {{20}},
Pages = {{65-70}},
Abstract = {{Advancements in technology over the last two decades have changed how
   spatial data are created and used. In particular, in the last decade,
   volunteered geographic information (VGI), i.e., the crowdsourcing of
   geographic information, has revolutionized the spatial domain by
   shifting the map-making process from the hands of experts to those of
   any willing contributor. Started in 2004, OpenStreetMap (OSM) is the
   pinnacle of VGI due to the large number of volunteers involved and the
   volume of spatial data generated. While the original objective of OSM
   was to create a free map of the world, its uses have shown how the
   potential of such an initiative goes well beyond map-making: ranging
   from projects such as the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap (HOT) project, that
   understands itself as a bridge between the OSM community and
   humanitarian responders, to collaborative projects such as Mapillary,
   where citizens take street-level images and the system aims to automate
   mapping. A common trend among these projects using OSM is the fact that
   the community dynamic tends to create spin-off projects. Currently, we
   see a drive towards projects that support sustainability goals using
   OSM. We discuss some such applications and highlight challenges posed by
   this new paradigm. We also explore the most promising future uses of
   this increasingly popular participatory phenomenon.}},

Abstract = {{As the world's largest crowdsourcing-based street view platform,
   Mapillary has received considerable attention in both research and
   practical applications. By February 2019, more than 20,000 users
   worldwide contributed approximately 6.3 million kilometers of
   streetscape sequences. In this study, we attempted to get a deep insight
   into the Mapillary project through an exploratory analysis from the
   perspective of contributors, including the development of users, the
   spatiotemporal analysis of active users, the contribution modes
   (walking, cycling, and driving), and the devices used to contribute. It
   shows that inequality exists in the distribution of contributed users,
   similar to that in other volunteered geographic information (VGI)
   projects. However, the inequality in Mapillary contribution is less than
   in OpenStreetMap (OSM). Compared to OSM, the other main difference is
   that the data collection demonstrated obvious seasonal variation because
   contributions to OSM can be accomplished on a computer, whereas images
   have to be captured on the streets for Mapillary, and this is
   considerably affected by seasonal weather.}},

   methodology with South East Queensland Flood tweets}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{42}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Social media was underutilised in disaster management practices, as it
   was not seen as a real-time ground level information harvesting tool
   during a disaster. In recent years, with the increasing popularity and
   use of social media, people have started to express their views,
   experiences, images, and video evidences through different social media
   platforms. Consequently, harnessing such crowdsourced information has
   become an opportunity for authorities to obtain enhanced situation
   awareness data for efficient disaster management practices. Nonetheless,
   the current disaster-related Twitter analytics methods are not versatile
   enough to define disaster impacts levels as interpreted by the local
   communities. This paper contributes to the existing knowledge by
   applying and extending a well-established data analysis framework, and
   identifying highly impacted disaster areas as perceived by the local
   communities. For this, the study used real-time Twitter data posted
   during the 2010-2011 South East Queensland Floods. The findings reveal
   that: (a) Utilising Twitter is a promising approach to reflect citizen
   knowledge; (b) Tweets could be used to identify the fluctuations of
   disaster severity over time; (c) The spatial analysis of tweets
   validates the applicability of geo-located messages to demarcate highly
   impacted disaster zones.}},

Title = {{Consistency assessment for open geodata integration: an ontology-based
   approach}},
Journal = {{GEOINFORMATICA}},
Abstract = {{Integrating heterogeneous geospatial data sources is important in
   various domains like smart cities, urban planning and governance, but
   remains a challenging research problem. In particular, the production of
   high-quality integrated data from multiple sources requires an
   understanding of their respective characteristics and a systematic
   assessment of the consistency within and between the data sources. In
   order to perform the assessment, the data has to be placed on a common
   ground. However, in practice, heterogeneous geodata are often provided
   in diverse formats and organized in significantly different structures.
   In this work, we propose a framework that uses an ontology-based
   approach to overcome the heterogeneity by means of a domain ontology, so
   that consistency rules can be evaluated at the unified ontological
   representation of the data sources. In our case study, we use open
   governmental data from Open Data Portals (ODPs) and volunteered
   geographic information from OpenStreetMap (OSM) as two test data sources
   in the area of the province of South Tyrol, Italy. Our preliminary
   experiment shows that the approach is effective in detecting
   inconsistencies within and between ODP and OSM data. These findings
   provide valuable insights for a better combined usage of these datasets.}},

Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{107}},
Pages = {{99-112}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Housing developments on the peri-urban fringe of Australian towns and
   cities create complexities for bushfire management due to the
   intermingling of natural, rural and urban spaces. To address the risk of
   bushfire, policies and practices have promoted and encouraged landowner
   responsibility for bushfire mitigation actions and behaviours. Using a
   postal survey, interviews and focus groups, we examine perceptions and
   actions regarding bushfire preparedness from the viewpoints of
   individual residents, landowners, and the local fire and environmental
   authorities on the Lower Eyre Peninsula of South Australia. Respondents
   living on larger sized allotments were more likely to perceive that
   their property was vulnerable to bushfire than those living on
   residential-sized allotments. Larger holdings tend to have more
   fire-susceptible vegetation than the smaller properties located in
   fringe suburbs, which seems to confer to those latter residents a sense
   of greater safety from bushfires. On the other hand, residents on larger
   blocks reported higher levels of bushfire management knowledge and
   expressed stronger connections to the place where they live, which
   influenced their willingness to work to mitigate bushfire risk.
   Importantly, there is a disconnection between such individual landholder
   preparedness for bushfire and that of the broader community. Individual
   actions often do not translate into collective responses, suggesting
   that a greater sense of shared responsibility will need to develop to
   enable effective mitigation of regional bushfire risk at a regional
   scale.}},

Abstract = {{This article explores the potential of web-based participatory mapping
   tools for urban planning purposes and spatial information creation in

   While an increasing use of mapping tools is found in developed

   a lack of information, human and financial resources. In the context of

Abstract = {{Senior citizens are commonly regarded as the vulnerable class of

Abstract = {{Recommender systems (RS), as supportive tools, filter information from a
   massive amount of data based on the determined preferences. Most of the
   RS require information about the context of users such as their
   locations. In such cases, location-aware recommender systems (LARS) can
   be employed to suggest more personalized items to the users. The most
   current research projects on LARS focus on the development of
   algorithms, evaluation methods and applications. However, the role of
   up-to-date spatial databases in LARS is not a well-researched area. The
   up-to-date spatial information would potentially improve the accuracy of
   items which are recommended by LARS. Volunteered geographic information
   (VGI) could be a low-cost source of up-to-date spatial information for
   LARS. This article proposes an approach to enrich spatial databases of
   LARS by VGI. Since not all records of VGI are fitted for use in LARS, a
   mechanism is developed to identify useful information. Some VGI data
   sets refer to existing spatial data in the database while other VGI data
   sets are shared for the first time. Therefore, the proposed method
   assessed the quality of VGI with reference source (for VGI which is
   existed in the database) and VGI without reference source (for VGI which
   is shared for the first time). To demonstrate the feasibility of the
   proposed approach, a mobile application has been developed to recommend
   suitable restaurants to the users based on their geospatial locations.
   The evaluation of the method indicates that VGI can potentially enhance
   the functionality of the LARS in predicting the users? interests.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{NOV 7}},
Abstract = {{Landslides disrupt livelihoods, cause loss of human lives and damages to
   property and infrastructure. In the case of Nepal, the destructive
   impact of landslides has been steadily increasing as a result of the
   rising occupation of marginal land and extreme weather events caused by
   climate change. In particular, the impacts of seasonal, shallow
   landslides have been underestimated due to underreporting, and lack
   appropriate policy response. Within this paper, we argue that citizen
   science - the practice of incorporating the general public in the
   process of knowledge co-production - may help address this issue by
   increasing the knowledge base of stakeholders at different levels. We
   present the preliminary results from an interdisciplinary scoping study
   of two landslide sites in Western Nepal, in Bajhang and Bajura, where
   the Landslide-EVO research project, including a citizen science
   component, is currently being implemented. The aim of the project is to
   innovate participatory environmental monitoring and to generate evidence
   to support resilience. Our exploratory qualitative investigation
   outlines the strategies currently employed by the local communities that
   continue living in the landslide affected areas. These include
   demographic shifts and patterns, land use changes and occupational
   diversification. We argue that these existing local adaptation and
   mitigation practices compound a wealth of experiential knowledge. Based
   on evidence from literature, as well as our first-hand experience of
   starting citizen science activities in the both landslide sites, we
   argue that citizen science has the potential to build on local knowledge
   base and strengthen the adaptive capacities of different level
   stakeholders. Our theoretical contribution is the proposed typology of
   citizen-science interventions. We distinguish between community science,
   participatory environmental monitoring and virtual citizen science,
   providing examples of how they can benefit stakeholders at different
   levels and/or different types of research. Finally, we examine the ways
   in which different types of citizen science could be applied in our case
   study sites, specifying the conditions under which they can attain
   maximum usefulness.}},

Abstract = {{Volunteered geographic information (VGI) encourages citizens to
   contribute geographic data voluntarily that helps to enhance geospatial

   research examines the hypothesis of evaluating the proficiency of the
   contributor to assess the credibility of the data contributed. The
   proposed framework consists of two phases, namely, an exploratory data
   analysis phase and a learning phase. The former explores OSM data
   history to perform feature selection, resulting in ``OSM Metadata{''}
   summarized using principal component analysis. The latter combines
   unsupervised and supervised learning through K-means for user-clustering
   and multi-class logistic regression for user classification. We

Title = {{Validation of spatial multicriteria decision analysis results using
   public participation GIS}},
Journal = {{APPLIED GEOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2019}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Spatial or GIS-based Multicriteria Decision Analysis (GIS-MCDA)
   incorporates a mixed set of theories, methods and tools in order to
   combine geospatial data with decision makers' judgments for the purpose
   of generating information required in spatial decision making. However,
   given the complex nature of spatial decision making processes,
   contradicting preferences of experts regarding the proper evaluation
   criteria to be used as well as uncertainty of inputs, the GIS-MCDA
   results may not be perfectly matched with the community preferences.
   Consequently, ensuring that the outcomes of decision-making processes
   are indeed consistent with the needs, values and preferences of the
   public is of critical importance. Accordingly, this study proceeds to
   employ Public Participation GIS (PPGIS) or citizen-generated information
   as reference data to validate the results of GIS-MCDA processes. This
   validation is carried out by means of certain spatial indices including
   total coverage, geometric intersection, central distances and
   statistical indices. To this end, the issue of selecting the optimal
   sites for the establishment of restaurants in Babolsar, Mazandaran
   province, was selected as the case study. The study proceeded by
   initially determining the optimal locations of restaurants based on
   expert opinion and via the GISbased Best-Worst multicriteria method.
   Next, a Web-based PPGIS tool was designed and implemented, enabling
   citizens to draw the optimal sites for restaurant establishment.
   Finally, the optimal locations determined via the multicriteria method
   (in three suitable, moderate and unsuitable classes) were compared and
   validated with PPGIS in accordance with the corresponding spatial
   indices. Although the suitable class of the GIS-MCDA output map
   (expert-derived restaurant sites), indicating preferences of experts,
   had the highest level of complete coverage (0.1\%) and intersection
   (2.6\%) with PPGIS (citizen-derived restaurant sites) as opposed to the
   other two classes, the validation results indicate a rather low level of
   consistency between experts' solution and citizen opinions in the
   designation of proper sites for the establishment of restaurants.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Renovation of Urban Blighted Areas (UBAs) plays a vital role in the
   improvement of Urban Quality of Life (UQL), notably in developing
   countries. Due to socio-economic and legal issues in UBAs, the
   renovation process cannot be sufficiently realized without the
   intervention of both public and private sectors. As active involvement
   of owners, investors and urban managers in urban renovation increases
   the success of renewal projects, more considerable attention has been
   paid to owner-investor participatory models in the last few decades. In
   order to promote participatory urban renewal processes, a Spatial
   (GIS-based) Decision Support System (SDSS) has been developed. The
   primary objective of proposed SDSS is to present a general framework for
   the involvement of owners, investors, and urban managers in UBA
   processes. Through the integration of Public Participation Geographic
   Information System (PPGIS) with Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA),
   the proposed SDSS provides an appropriate tool for the facilitation of
   participatory renewal procedures in UBAs. In addition to entering,
   storing, manipulating, analyzing and representing spatial data related
   to UBAs, the system provides further features for stakeholders including
   spatial negotiation, weighting, prioritization, validation, monitoring,
   and decision rule capabilities. The SDSS has been implemented in Tehran,
   and its quality has been validated from the perspective of developers,
   experts, and end users (owners and investors) in accordance with the
   ISO/IEC\_9126 standard. Based on three group's opinion, the system is
   relatively acceptable in terms of functionality, reliability, usability,
   efficiency, maintainability, and portability in facilitating the urban
   renewal process.}},

Abstract = {{For most protected areas visitor data is limited, even for popular
   activities such as mountain biking, walking and running. With the
   exponential increase in volunteered geographic information, it is now
   possible to assess visitation to parks by people using social media. The
   number of routes posted to MapMyFitness, Strava and Wikiloc were used to
   assess the relative popularity of 40 national parks in South East
   Queensland, Australia for mountain biking, walking and running. Then,
   using generalised linear models, the topographic, geographic, management
   and environmental variables that best predicted park popularity among
   users were identified. There were more than 450,000 visits to the parks,
   with 98\% of routes posted on Strava. Distance (road and direct
   distance) from large urban areas best predicted visitation using routes
   from MapMyFitness and Strava with three parks within 2 km of urban areas
   experiencing over 70,000 visits (Strava). For urban parks, recreational
   trail length best predicted usage, while for more remote parks, the
   direct distance to urban areas remained the most important factor. In
   contrast, people using the adventure platform Wikiloc preferred more
   remote parks with rugged terrain. The results highlight factors
   affecting park popularity including distance. With the expansion and
   densification of cities, including in Australia, urban and peri-urban
   parks are likely to experience increasing levels of use for
   fitness-based activities while more remote parks may remain attractive
   among people focused on adventure.}},

Abstract = {{The increase in floods and flash floods over the last decades has
   motivated researchers to develop improved methodologies for flood risk
   prevention and warning. Flood forecasting models available today have
   evolved technologically but are subject to limitations due to the lack
   of data and limited community participation. This paper presents the
   Hydrological Alert Model with Participatory Basis (HAMPB) model, an
   approach for integrating water level data reported by citizens, which
   has the advantage of being inexpensive and potentially highly available,
   with traditional data to improve flood forecasting. The model
   assimilates spatiotemporal water levels measured in the field when they
   are available through a real-time estimator. We added random
   perturbations of up to |10| and |15| cm to those data using the Monte
   Carlo Method to mimic the uncertainty in citizen science data
   collection. Applying the HAMPB model for urban nested-scale catchments
   (0.11 km(2) <= Area <= 21.84 km(2)) in Brazil shows: (a) significant
   improvements in flood simulations when field data was assimilated even
   considering the volunteered data uncertainty; (b) capability to update
   simulations in more than one point in the semi-distributed hydrological
   model by a regionalization method; and (c) flood hazard indexes and

Abstract = {{Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) has become the predominant strategy for
   pre-emptively countering the havoc threatened by natural hazards,
   complementing traditional disaster management, and recovery activities.
   An important component of DRR activities is community involvement,
   imbuing the community with a sense of ownership of the risk reduction
   process, and thus increasing resilience to deal with natural hazards.
   Though the desirability for community engagement is acknowledged, the
   differing hazards, environments and community contexts, all pose many
   obstacles to enabling meaningful participation. This paper describes a
   participative, community-oriented initiative for DRR in a context of the
   most common hazard faced by communities worldwide, that of flooding. A
   novel platform is presented which embraces participatory science
   principles in facilitating active community engagement in all stages of
   the flooding lifecycle. It is demonstrated how observations contributed
   by a community can contribute both to the practical mitigation of the
   effects of flooding and the calibration of inundation models. The
   novelty of the platform lies in its emphasis on mitigation activities
   during the pre-flood stage, as well as its innovative use of image
   capture for enabling the safe assessment of water levels by the

Abstract = {{This study proposes that the structure of visitor flows within a

   generated by visitors. In particular, destination network metrics (i.e.,
   density, in-degree centralization, out-degree centralization,
   betweenness centralization, and global clustering coefficient) for 29
   Florida counties were derived from 4.3 million geotagged photos found on
   the photo sharing service Flickr and then correlated with
   visitor-related spending reported by the Florida Department of Revenue.
   The results of regression analyses indicate that density, out-degree
   centralization, and in-degree centralization are negatively correlated
   with total visitor-related spending within a destination, while
   betweenness centralization is found to have a positive relationship.
   Based on these findings, it is concluded that the economic value
   generated by tourism is constrained by the destination network structure
   of supply-side and demand-side interactions. Further, it is argued that
   a ``network orchestrator{''} approach to management can be used to

Abstract = {{BackgroundGlobal warming has reduced the adaptability of the people
   living in subtropical regions to cope up with cold stress due to
   lengthening of hot days and shortening of transition period from hot to
   cold weather. However, existing studies on measuring cold stress are
   based on biometeorological indices designed for temperate regions. This
   may overestimate the impact of wind chill on mortality risk in
   subtropical cities.MethodsThis study developed an Adjusted Wind Chill
   Equivalent Temperature (AWCET) index. A spatially-controlled
   time-stratified approach was applied to evaluate the ability of AWCET
   for estimating cold mortality in subtropical cities, based on a
   mortality dataset (2008-2012) in Hong Kong.ResultsThe use of AWCET could
   indicate increase in all-cause, cardiovascular, respiratory, and
   cancer-related mortality risk during the days with average temperature<=
   1st {[}11.0 degrees C], <= 3rd {[}12.6 degrees C] and<= 5th {[}13.4
   degrees C] percentiles. The results were stable and consistent based on
   both log-linear and curve-linear relationships between AWCET and
   mortality risk. AWCET was also compared with the New Wind Chill
   Equivalent Temperature (NWCET) designed for temperate regions, and has
   found that higher magnitude of mortality risk would be found when using
   AWCET for assessing all-cause and cause-specific mortality in Hong Kong,
   for days with average temperature<= 1st, <= 3rd and<= 5th
   percentiles.ConclusionsAWCET is validated to be effective to access cold
   mortality in the context of subtropical cities. The use of AWCET may
   enhance the cold weather warning system in subtropical cities, as a
   supplementary tool to help demonstrating small administrative-level
   perceived temperature with volunteered geographic information.}},

Abstract = {{Social media images are a novel source of data to assess how people view

   sociocultural values relating to ecosystem services including those

   images, including for remote environments, we analysed the content of
   images posted to Flickr by people visiting a national park that contains
   the highest mountain in the southern hemisphere, Mt. Aconcagua, in
   Argentina, South America. The saliency of aesthetic landscapes,
   recreation, social relations and fresh-water provisioning was high
   across the 334 images posted to Flickr by 104 visitors to the Park, but
   location mattered. Images from visitors in easily accessible day-use
   areas were significantly more likely to include content that reflects
   biodiversity-existence, geology, culture and education services, while
   the content of images from remote areas was more likely to reflect
   social relations and fresh-water provision services. Comparisons of the
   content of images from Mt. Aconcagua with other studies in Europe, South

Abstract = {{In the last decade, the crowdsourced geographic information platform,
   OpenStreetMap (OSM), has become a critical tool for emergency response
   efforts during large-scale crisis events such as hurricanes, typhoons
   and earthquakes. Events such as the 2010 Haiti earthquake, have
   attracted massive organized relief responses on the OSM platform. During
   these events, new and experienced OSM contributors have helped map
   critical infrastructure necessary for relief efforts. While much is
   understood about how OSM users organized and contributed during these
   large-scale events, little has been researched as to how contributors
   respond to smaller scale events. This study investigates how OSM users
   contribute to the map in response to small-scale crisis events by
   comparing OSM user contributions from four recent building fire
   incidents located in Western and Non-Western countries and areas of
   varying degrees of map completeness. Analysis determined whether there
   was an increase in OSM contributions in the immediate aftermath of an
   incident and characterized these contributors as serious or casual
   mappers, local to or remote from the incident, and what kinds of
   features or attributes are being updated. Results from this research
   showed an increase in user contributions for most incidents in the 30
   days after the incident, with 41-98\% of contributions occurring in the
   first 10 days after an event for some study areas. Based on each
   contributor editing history, most contributors were classified as being
   serious, remote mappers. This research contributes to a growing body of

Abstract = {{The internet has become an integral part of social activism. The
   widespread nature of movements such as \#OccupyWallStreet and
   \#BlackLivesMatter on social media demonstrate the web's efficacy in
   raising awareness on social issues. These movements often have their
   detractors, however, and online debate on racial protest in particular
   is often vigorous. While the \#BlackLivesMatter movement has drawn
   considerable attention in sociological circles, little work has been
   conducted on how content manifests itself over space. In this article, I
   undertake a place-based approach to studying the factors driving
   \#BlackLivesMatter and counter-protest content (e.g., \#AllLivesMatter)
   through geolocated tweets in Louisiana and Texas Census Designated and
   Incorporated Places (i.e. cities). I find that the production of content
   meshes with color-blind racial theory and aligns with some offline
   processes, but perhaps not in the ways that one might expect. Percent
   black and percent Asian have a positive association with the production
   of both \#BlackLivesMatter and \#AllLivesMatter content, while percent
   white and percent Hispanic have a negative association. The approach
   presented is novel in that it utilizes tweets with general location and
   information from users' profile descriptions. The post hoc analysis
   demonstrates how bifurcating the data based on spatial and temporal
   characteristics can reveal subtle but, informative trends, yet results
   should be interpreted cautiously.}},

Abstract = {{Data contributed by a large number of non-experts is increasingly used
   to validate and curate land cover data, with location-based games (LBGs)
   developed for this purpose generating particular interest. We here
   present our findings on StarBorn, a novel LBG with a strong focus on
   game play. Users conquer game-tiles by visiting real-world locations and
   collecting land cover data. Within three months, StarBorn generated
   13,319 land cover classifications by 84 users. Results show that data
   are concentrated around users' daily life spaces, agreement among users
   is highest for urban and industry land cover, and user-generated land
   cover classifications exhibit high agreement with an authoritative data
   set. However, we also observe low user retention rates and negative
   correlations between number of contributions and agreement rates with an
   authoritative land cover product. We recommend that future work consider
   not only game play, but also how motivational aspects influence behavior
   and data quality. We conclude that LBGs are suitable tools for
   generating cost-efficient in-situ land cover classifications.}},

Abstract = {{Sports has an important role for the health of present societies and the

   neighboring settlement areas, which use the facility. Entropy can be
   used as a criterion for the quantitative measure of spatial information

Abstract = {{Rescue requests during large-scale urban flood disasters can be
   difficult to validate and prioritise. High-resolution aerial imagery is
   often unavailable or lacks the necessary geographic extent, making it
   difficult to obtain real-time information about where flooding is
   occurring. In this paper, we present a novel approach to map the extent
   of urban flooding in Harris County, Texas during Hurricane Harvey
   (August 25-30, 2017) and identify where people were most likely to need
   immediate emergency assistance. Using Maximum Entropy, we predict the
   probability of flooding based on several spatially-distributed physical
   and socio-economic characteristics coupled with crowdsourced data. We
   compare the results against two alternative flood datasets available
   after Hurricane Harvey (i.e., Copernicus satellite imagery and riverine
   flood depths estimated by FEMA), and we validate the performance of the
   model using a 15\% subset of the rescue requests, Houston 311 flood
   calls, and inundated roadways. We find that the model predicts a much
   larger area of flooding than was shown by either Copernicus or FEMA when
   compared against the locations of rescue requests, and that it performs
   well using both a subset of rescue requests (AUC 0.917) and 311 calls
   (AUC 0.929) but is less sensitive to inundated roads (AUC 0.721).}},

Month = {{SEP 18}},
Abstract = {{Citizen science for disaster risk reduction (DRR) holds huge promise and
   has demonstrated success in advancing scientific knowledge, providing
   early warning of hazards, and contributed to the assessment and
   management of impacts. While many existing studies focus on the
   performance of specific citizen science examples, this paper goes beyond
   this approach to present a systematic global mapping of citizen science
   used for DRR in order to draw out broader insights across diverse
   methods, initiatives, hazards and country contexts. The systematic
   mapping analyzed a total of 106 cases of citizen science applied to DRR
   across all continents. Unlike many existing reviews of citizen science
   initiatives, relevance to the disaster risk context led us to `open up'
   our mapping to a broader definition of what might constitute citizen
   science, including participatory research and narrative-based
   approaches. By taking a wider view of citizen science and opening up to
   other disciplinary practices as valid ways of knowing risks and hazards,
   we also capture these alternative examples and discuss their relevance
   for aiding effective decision-making around risk reduction. Based on
   this analysis we draw out lessons for future research and practice of
   citizen science for DRR including the need to: build interconnections
   between disparate citizen science methods and practitioners; address
   multi-dimensionality within and across hazard cycles; and develop
   principles and frameworks for evaluating citizen science initiatives
   that not only ensure scientific competence but also attend to questions
   of equity, responsibility and the empowerment of those most vulnerable

Volume = {{231}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Accuracy assessment and land cover mapping have been inexorably linked
   throughout the first 50 years of publication of Remote Sensing of
   Environment. The earliest developers of land-cover maps recognized the
   importance of evaluating the quality of their maps, and the methods and
   reporting format of these early accuracy assessments included features
   that would be familiar to practitioners today. Specifically,
   practitioners have consistently recognized the importance of obtaining
   high quality reference data to which the map is compared, the need for
   sampling to collect these reference data, and the role of an error
   matrix and accuracy measures derived from the error matrix to summarize
   the accuracy information. Over the past half century these techniques
   have undergone refinements to place accuracy assessment on a more
   scientifically credible footing. We describe the current status of
   accuracy assessment that has emerged from nearly 50 years of practice
   and identify opportunities for future advances. The article is organized
   by the three major components of accuracy assessment, the sampling
   design, response design, and analysis, focusing on good practice
   methodology that contributes to a rigorous, informative, and honest
   assessment. The long history of research and applications underlying the
   current practice of accuracy assessment has advanced the field to a
   mature state. However, documentation of accuracy assessment methods
   needs to be improved to enhance reproducibility and transparency, and
   improved methods are required to address new challenges created by
   advanced technology that has expanded the capacity to map land cover

Abstract = {{Volunteered geographic information (VGI) contains valuable field
   observations that represent the spatial distribution of geographic
   phenomena. As such, it has the potential to provide regularly updated
   low-cost field samples for predictively mapping the spatial variations
   of geographic phenomena. The predictive mapping of geographic phenomena
   often requires representative samples for high mapping accuracy, but
   samples consisting of VGI observations are often not representative as
   they concentrate on specific geographic areas (i.e. spatial bias) due to
   the opportunistic nature of voluntary observation efforts. In this
   article, we propose a representativeness-directed approach to mitigate
   spatial bias in VGI for predictive mapping. The proposed approach
   defines and quantifies sample representativeness by comparing the
   probability distributions of sample locations and the mapping area in
   the environmental covariate space. Spatial bias is mitigated by
   weighting the sample locations to maximize their representativeness. The
   approach is evaluated using species habit suitability mapping as a case
   study. The results show that the accuracy of predictive mapping using
   weighted sample locations is higher than using unweighted sample
   locations. A positive relationship between sample representativeness and
   mapping accuracy is also observed, suggesting that sample
   representativeness is a valid indicator of predictive mapping accuracy.
   This approach mitigates spatial bias in VGI to improve predictive
   mapping accuracy.}},

Volume = {{29}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Pluvial flooding is caused by intense rainfall events that overwhelm
   drainage systems and do not allow excess water to be absorbed by soils
   or water infrastructure. We examined the spatial characteristics of
   pluvial flooding in Portland, OR (2010-2017) by using citizen-reported
   flooding data. We used a spatially dense network of 5-min interval
   rainfall measurement to examine the relationship between the size of
   3-day storm events and the frequency of flooding reports that were
   normalized by the population density at the census block group scale.
   Seventy percent of flooding reports were generated at smaller storm
   sizes of 5 cm or less over a 3-day period due to these storm sizes
   occurring more frequently across the observed time period. The flood
   reports were mainly clustered in the hilly west side, lower far north,
   central, and southeast regions of the city regardless of the time of
   year reports were generated. The flood reports were highest at the
   beginning of the wet season and decreased throughout the wet season.
   Flood reports were negatively associated with elevation variables. We

Abstract = {{In recent years, volunteered-geographic-information (VGI) image data
   have served as a data source for various geographic applications,
   attracting researchers to assess the quality of these images. However,
   these applications and quality assessments are generally focused on
   images associated with geolocation through textual annotations, which is
   only part of valid images to them. In this paper, we explore the
   distribution pattern for most relevant VGI images of specific landmarks
   to extend the current quality analysis, and to provide guidance for
   improving the data-retrieval process of geographic applications.
   Distribution is explored in terms of two aspects, namely, semantic
   distribution and spatial distribution. In this paper, the term semantic
   distribution is used to describe the matching of building-image tags and
   content with each other. There are three kinds of images
   (semantic-relevant and content-relevant, semantic-relevant but
   content-irrelevant, and semantic-irrelevant but content-relevant).
   Spatial distribution shows how relevant images are distributed around a
   landmark. The process of this work can be divided into three parts: data
   filtering, retrieval of relevant landmark images, and distribution
   analysis. For semantic distribution, statistical results show that an
   average of 60\% of images tagged with the building's name actually
   represents the building, while 69\% of images depicting the building are
   not annotated with the building's name. There was also an observation
   that for most landmarks, 97\% of relevant building images were located
   within 300 m around the building in terms of spatial distribution.}},

Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The problem of discovering regions that support particular
   functionalities in an urban setting has been approached in literature
   using two general methodologies: top-down, encoding expert knowledge on
   urban planning and design and discovering regions that conform to that
   knowledge; and bottom-up, using data to train machine learning models,
   which can discover similar regions. Both methodologies face limitations,
   with knowledge-based approaches being criticized for scalability and
   transferability issues and data-driven approaches for lacking
   interpretability and depending heavily on data quality. To mitigate
   these disadvantages, we propose a novel framework that fuses a
   knowledge-based approach using design patterns and a data-driven
   approach using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling in three
   different ways: Functional regions discovered using either approach are
   evaluated against each other to identify cases of significant agreement
   or disagreement; knowledge from patterns is used to adjust topic
   probabilities in the learning model; and topic probabilities are used to
   adjust pattern-based results. The proposed methodologies are
   demonstrated through the use case of identifying shopping-related
   regions in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. Results show that the
   combination of pattern-based discovery and topic modeling extraction
   helps uncover discrepancies between the two approaches and smooth
   inaccuracies caused by the limitations of each approach.}},

Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The southeastern coast of China suffers many typhoon disasters every
   year, causing huge casualties and economic losses. In addition,
   collecting statistics on typhoon disaster situations is hard work for
   the government. At the same time, near-real-time disaster-related
   information can be obtained on developed social media platforms like
   Twitter and Weibo. Many cases have proved that citizens are able to
   organize themselves promptly on the spot, and begin to share disaster
   information when a disaster strikes, producing massive VGI (volunteered
   geographic information) about the disaster situation, which could be
   valuable for disaster response if this VGI could be exploited
   efficiently and properly. However, this social media information has
   features such as large quantity, high noise, and unofficial modes of
   expression that make it difficult to obtain useful information. In order
   to solve this problem, we first designed a new classification system
   based on the characteristics of social medial data like Sina Weibo data,
   and made a microblogging dataset of typhoon damage with according
   category labels. Secondly, we used this social medial dataset to train
   the deep learning model, and constructed a typhoon disaster mining model
   based on a deep learning network, which could automatically extract
   information about the disaster situation. The model is different from
   the general classification system in that it automatically selected
   microblogs related to disasters from a large number of microblog data,

Abstract = {{Further attention should be paid to contextualizing the spaces and

   maps from the bottom up as well as the top down. The motivations of
   amateur cartographers, the contexts in which map-making takes place, and
   the technological processes involved are all important factors to
   consider when examining how and why maps are produced. Empirical
   ethnographic evidence from a study of OpenStreetMap and humanitarian
   ``mapping parties{''} is presented here to demonstrate how the often
   overlooked cultures of amateur map-making offer novel perspectives on
   who contemporary map-makers are and what motivates them to map. It is
   shown that amateur map-making is a broad category that includes
   close-knit hobby communities and more diverse groups of enthusiastic
   volunteers. As cartography continues to open up and become more
   accessible through a range of digital mapping technologies, studying
   these shifts will be important for understanding how and why the role of

   better analyze this effect. However, such datasets are large and have
   heterogeneous characteristics requiring visual-interactive applications

   comprehend the influencing causes and their effects. Subsequently, we

Abstract = {{Digital technologies that allow large numbers of laypeople to contribute
   to humanitarian action facilitate the deepening adoption and adaptation
   of private-sector logics and rationalities in humanitarianism. This is
   increasingly taking place through philanthro-capitalism, a process in
   which philanthropy and humanitarianism are made central to business
   models. Key to this transformation is the way private businesses find
   supporting ``digital humanitarian{''} organisations such as Standby Task
   Force to be amenable to their capital accumulation imperatives.
   Private-sector institutions channel feelings of closeness to aid
   recipients that digital humanitarian technologies enable, in order to
   legitimise their claims to ``help{''} the recipients. This has
   ultimately led to humanitarian and state institutions re-articulating
   capitalist logics in ways that reflect the new digital humanitarian
   avenues of entry. In this article, I characterise this process by
   drawing out three capitalist logics that humanitarian and state
   institutions re-articulate in the context of digital humanitarianism, in
   an emergent form of philanthro-capitalism. Specifically, I argue that
   branding, efficiency, and bottom lines take altered forms in this
   context, in part being de-politicised as a necessary condition for their
   adoption. This de-politicisation involves normalising these logics by
   framing social and political problems as technical in nature and thus
   both beyond critique and amenable to digital humanitarian
   ``solutions{''}. I take this line of argumentation to then re-politicise
   each of these logics and the capitalist relations that they entail.}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims to qualify the behaviour of contributors to
   OpenStreetMap (OSM), a volunteered geographic information (VGI) project,

   contributor's interactions in a more comprehensive way. First, we define
   a multigraph that combines existing spatial collaboration networks from
   the literature with new graphs that illustrate collaboration based on
   specific aspects of the VGI modes of contribution through semantics,
   geometry and topology. Indeed, the ways that contributors interact with
   one another through editing, completion, or even consumption may provide
   additional information on each user's operation mode and therefore, on
   the quality of the contributed data. Social collaborations drawn from
   indirect criteria - for example, comparisons between contributors'
   activity areas - can also be contemplated under another network. Second,
   the resulting multigraph is analysed using data mining approaches to
   characterise individuals and identify behavioural groups. The
   implementation of a multiplex network based on an OSM data sample and an
   initial analysis make it possible to identify useful behaviours for data
   qualification. The initial results characterise some contributors as
   pioneers, moderators and truthful contributors, according to their
   special roles in the graphs. Mapping elements that include these
   contributors' participation are likely to be reliable data}},

Abstract = {{Wikimapia is a major privately owned volunteered geographic information

   years, Wikimapia has attracted hundreds of thousands of contributors and
   collected millions of data points, including towns, restaurants, lakes
   and tourist attractions (http://wikimapia.org). Unlike OpenStreetMap,
   Wikimapia adopts a placial' perspective, favouring rich descriptions
   over detailed geometries and encouraging the collection of textual and
   visual content about places with approximate footprints. In this
   article, we first trace the origin and development of Wikimapia as a
   for-profit project, intimately linked with search engine advertising.
   Drawing on an in-depth interview with a former developer, we analyse
   project's data model and characteristics of its community. As Wikimapia
   discussions are rife with copyright issues, we discuss the project's
   intellectual property, as well as its strategies for quality management.
   Second, we focus on the popularity of the project, which is crucial to
   the longevity and sustainability of VGI projects. Using behavioural data
   from Google Trends, we trace a geography of Interest in Wikimapia,
   comparing with that in OpenStreetMap, from a temporal and spatial
   perspective. While OpenStreetMap attracts more interest in high-income
   countries, Wikimapia emerges as relatively more popular in low- and
   middle-income countries, countering the received notion of VGI as a
   Global North phenomenon. Our study suggests that Wikimapia's popularity

Abstract = {{Reliable techniques to generate accurate data sets of human built-up

   e.g., for humanitarian organizations. In this paper, we investigated the
   complementary value of crowdsourcing and deep learning to fill the data
   gaps of existing earth observation-based (EO) products. To this end, we
   propose a novel workflow to combine deep learning (DeepVGI) and
   crowdsourcing (MapSwipe). Our strategy for allocating classification
   tasks to deep learning or crowdsourcing is based on confidence of the
   derived binary classification. We conducted case studies in three
   different sites located in Guatemala, Laos, and Malawi to evaluate the
   proposed workflow. Our study reveals that crowdsourcing and deep
   learning outperform existing EO-based approaches and products such as
   the Global Urban Footprint. Compared to a crowdsourcing-only approach,
   the combination increased the quality (measured by Matthew's correlation
   coefficient) of the generated human settlement maps by 3 to 5 percentage
   points. At the same time, it reduced the volunteer efforts needed by at

Abstract = {{The sharing of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) tracks on the

   Individually these tracks present a poor positional accuracy because

   solution. This study analyses this possibility using a wide set of
   tracks obtained in known conditions. We emulated those tracks obtained
   by Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) users and we compared the

   accurate source. Additionally, we analyse the displacement of other axes
   obtained by varying several parameters such as the number of tracks and
   their length or by dividing the route into sections in function of

Abstract = {{Crime occurrence is an ever-increasing social problem of Tehran city.
   Crime management for this city requires social action, public
   participation or community-oriented policing. In this regard,
   Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) systems can be of great support

   society can act as active, intelligent, responsible, location-aware,
   mobile, and distributed sensors in order to monitor and report local
   crimes and generate crime data. Analysis of such data can be
   substantially helpful in crime management within Tehran. Therefore, the
   objective of this study is to develop a VGI-based system as a means for
   crime management in District \# 22 of Tehran. Using this system,
   citizens and police departments can accurately report and analyze
   various information such as precise location, type, photo, date and
   time. Citizens' feedbacks indicate that the system is easy-to-use
   (highly 55\%, very highly 31\%), suitable for reporting and presenting
   crime data (highly 90\%) and reducing crime rates (highly 40\%, very
   highly 35\%), all the while providing an attractive user interface
   (highly 25\%, moderately 45\%). However, most citizens stated that the
   system is highly dependent in its need for prior knowledge (highly
   75\%). On the other hand, evaluation results by police departments show
   that the system facilitates the entire crime management process.}},

   The VGI does not usually include information about the positional

   positions. Consequently, the assessment is based on a field test that
   consisted of a vehicle which travelled a highway with a set of Global

   contributors. These devices captured positions of trackpoints with a
   time interval of 1 second. Additionally, a more accurate geodetic
   RTK-GNSS receptor controlled these positions. The paper describes the
   methodology employed, taking into account several parameters such as the
   acquisition time interval, the accuracy of control positions, etc. The
   results have demonstrated the viability of the methodology applied, the
   possible use of VGI in order to determine the speed values of the
   trackpoints and the possible improvement in the accuracy achieved with
   the increase of the distance between trackpoints (and as a consequence

Abstract = {{In the past decade, Volunteered Geographic Information(VGI) has emerged

   anew recommender tool which evaluates the positional plausibility of
   incoming POI registrations in OSM by generating near real-timevalidation
   scores. Similar to machine learning techniques, the tool discovers,
   stores and reapplies binary distance-basedcoexistence patterns between
   one specific POI and its surrounding objects. To clarify the idea, basic
   concepts about analysing coexistence patterns including design

   government agencies in Canada to progress, it is important to identify
   the Canada-specific barriers and constraints. This study offers a new
   perspective from Canadian government emergency management agencies to
   address this gap. Through a series of semi-structured interviews with 15
   government officials from 14 agencies, this study identifies the primary
   challenges and constraints faced by Canadian agencies looking to adopt
   crisis crowdsourcing. Results indicate that organizational factors,
   policies, and federal legislation in Canada present barriers to crisis
   crowdsourcing (including crowdsourcing through social media) adoption
   within agencies at various levels of government. Based on these results,
   recommendations are made to support the adoption of crisis crowdsourcing
   amongst Canadian government agencies.}},

Abstract = {{Death tolls and economic losses from natural hazards continue to rise in
   many parts of the world. With the aim to reduce future impacts from
   natural disasters it is crucial to understand the variability in space
   and time of the vulnerability of people and economic assets. In this
   paper we quantified the temporal dynamics of socio-economic
   vulnerability, expressed as fatalities over exposed population and
   losses over exposed GDP, to climate-related hazards between 1980 and
   2016. Using a global, spatially explicit framework that integrates
   population and economic dynamics with one of the most complete natural
   disaster loss databases we quantified mortality and loss rates across
   income levels and analyzed their relationship with wealth. Results show
   a clear decreasing trend in both human and economic vulnerability, with
   global average mortality and economic loss rates that have dropped by
   6.5 and nearly 5 times, respectively, from 1980-1989 to 2007-2016. We
   further show a clear negative relation between vulnerability and wealth,
   which is strongest at the lowest income levels. This has led to a
   convergence in vulnerability between higher and lower income countries.
   Yet, there is still a considerable climate hazard vulnerability gap
   between poorer and richer countries.}},

Abstract = {{Volunteered geographic information (VGI) refers to geospatial data that

   linked data and thesaurus. The method has two stages, one automatic and
   one manual. The automatic stage links VGI contributions to places that
   are of interest to users. In the manual stage, a thesaurus in the hydric
   domain was built based on terms found in VGI. Finally, a process is
   proposed, which returns semantically similar VGI contributions based on
   queries made by users. To verify the viability of the proposed method,
   contributions from the VGI system Gota D'agua, related to water waste

Abstract = {{Inorganic sediment is not the only solid-fraction component of river
   flows; flows may also carry significant amounts of large organic
   material (i.e. large wood), but the characteristics of these wood-laden
   flows (WLFs) are not well understood yet. With the aim to shed light on
   these relatively unexamined phenomena, we collected home videos showing
   natural flows with wood as the main solid component. Analyses of these
   videos as well as the watersheds and streams where the videos were
   recorded allowed us to define for the first time WLFs, describe the main
   characteristics of these flows and broaden the definition of wood
   transport regimes (adding a new regime called here hypercongested wood
   transport). According to our results, WLFs may occur repeatedly, in a
   large range of catchment sizes, generally in steep, highly confined
   single thread channels in mountain areas. WLFs are typically highly
   unsteady and the log motion is non-uniform, as described for other
   inorganic sediment-laden flows (e.g. debris flows). The conceptual
   integration of wood into our understanding of flow phenomena is
   illustrated by a novel classification defining the transition from clear
   water to hypercongested, wood and sediment-laden flows, according to the
   composition of the mixture (sediment, wood, and water). We define the
   relevant metrics for the quantification and modelling of WLFs, including
   an exhaustive discussion of different modelling approaches (i.e.
   Voellmy, Bingham and Manning) and provide a first attempt to simulate
   WLFs. We draw attention to WLF phenomena to encourage further field,
   theoretical, and experimental investigations that may contribute to a
   better understanding of flows in river basins, leading to more accurate
   predictions, and better hazard mitigation and management strategies. (c)

Abstract = {{Landuse characterization is important for urban planning. It is
   traditionally performed with field surveys or manual photo
   interpretation, two practices that are time-consuming and
   labor-intensive. Therefore, we aim to automate landuse mapping at the
   urban-object level with a deep learning approach based on data from
   multiple sources (or modalities). We consider two image modalities:
   overhead imagery from Google Maps and ensembles of ground-based pictures
   (side-views) per urban-object from Google Street View (GSV). These
   modalities bring complementary visual information pertaining to the
   urban-objects. We propose an end-to-end trainable model, which uses
   OpenStreetMap annotations as labels. The model can accommodate a
   variable number of GSV pictures for the ground-based branch and can also
   function in the absence of ground pictures at prediction time. We test
   the effectiveness of our model over the area of Ile-de-France, France,
   and test its generalization abilities on a set of urban-objects from the
   city of Nantes, France. Our proposed multimodal Convolutional Neural
   Network achieves considerably higher-accuracies than methods that use a
   single image modality, making it suitable for automatic landuse map
   updates. Additionally, our approach could be easily scaled to multiple

Abstract = {{The World Urban Database and Access Portal Tools (WUDAPT) project has

   derived from the OSM database and combined with seasonal LCZ maps.
   Therefore a methodology was developed and tested for Hamburg, Germany,

   applied to combine the inputs from OSM with each of the seasonal LCZ

   Study of the Social Risks of Floods in Central Spain}},
Journal = {{WATER}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Calibration and validation of flood risk maps at a national or a
   supra-national level remains a problematic aspect due to the limited
   information available to carry out these tasks. However, this validation
   is essential to define the representativeness of the results and for end
   users to gain confidence in them. In recent years, the use of
   information derived from social networks is becoming generalized in the
   field of natural risks as a means of validating results. However, the
   use of data from social networks also has its drawbacks, such as the
   biases associated with age and gender and their spatial distribution.
   The use of information associated with phone calls to Emergency Services
   (112) can resolve these deficiencies, although other problems are still
   latent. For example, a bias does exist in the relationship between the
   size of the population and the number of calls to the Emergency
   Services. This last aspect determines that global regression models have
   not been effective in simulating the behavior of related variables
   (calls to Emergency Services-Potential Flood Risk). Faced with this
   situation, the use of local regression models (such as locally estimated
   scatterplot smoothing (LOESS)) showed satisfactory results in the
   calibration of potential flood risk levels in the Autonomous Community
   of Castilla-La Mancha (Spain). This provides a new methodological path
   to the calibration studies of flood risk cartographies at national and
   supra-national levels. The results obtained through LOESS local
   regression models allowed us to establish the correct relationship
   between categorized potential risk levels and the inferred potential
   risk. They also permitted us to define the cases in which said levels
   differed ostensibly and where potential risk due to floods assigned to
   those municipalities led to a lower level of confidence. Therefore,
   based on the number of calls to the Emergency Service, we can categorize
   those municipalities that should be the subject of a more detailed study
   and those whose classification should be revised in future updates.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents an approach to road network extraction in remote
   sensing images. In our earlier work, we worked on the extraction of the
   road network using a multi-agent approach guided by Volunteered
   Geographic Information (VGI). The limitation of this VGI-only approach
   is its inability to update the new road developments as it only follows
   the VGI. In this work, we employ a deep learning approach to update the
   road network to include new road developments not captured by the
   existing VGI. The output of the first stage is used to train a
   Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in the second stage to generate a
   general model to classify road pixels. Post-processing is used to
   correct the undesired artifacts such as buildings, vegetation,
   occlusions, etc. to generate a final road map. Our proposed method is
   tested on the satellite images acquired over Abu Dhabi, United Arab
   Emirates and the aerial images acquired over Massachusetts, United
   States of America, and is observed to produce accurate results.}},

Abstract = {{Urban nature reserves are increasingly popular for recreational
   activities but who uses them, for what activities, and when and where do
   visitors go? Volunteered geographic information has only recently
   started to be used by managers to examine patterns of trail use in
   reserves. As yet, little is known about the benefits and limitations of
   this type of data. Therefore, we compared how mountain bikers, runners
   and walkers use popular reserves (Daisy Hill Conservation Park, Venman
   Bushland National Park and Bayview Conservation Area) close to Brisbane,
   Australia, based on extracted route data from the fitness tracking
   application MapMyFitness. Routes for all three activity types were
   displayed and analysed using ArcGIS. Mountain biking was more popular
   (49\% of the 948 routes), than walking (27\%) or running (24\%) across
   the three reserves. Route data was effective at predicting the relative
   popularity of specific trails with significant linear regressions when
   compared with fixed-point trail counts (R-2 = 0.681). Bikers went
   further, used a greater range of trail combinations and used more
   reserves per trip than the other two activities. Weekends were popular
   for all three activities, but more so for biking (57\%), than walking
   (44\%), or running (43\%). The results highlight how volunteered
   geographic information complements other trail data allowing urban
   planners and managers to better assess visitor movements in reserves. A
   number of specific management challenges were identified, such as bikers
   using more areas within and across the reserves, and in some cases, the
   use of private land and unauthorised access points.}},

Abstract = {{Volunteered geographic information (VGI) is crowdsourced information
   that can enrich and enhance research and applications based on

   and positional accuracy is a fundamental basis for the VGI quality
   assurance. A buffer-zone method can be used for its assessment, but the
   buffer radius in this technique is subjectively specified; as result,
   different selections of the buffer radius lead to different positional
   accuracies. To solve this problem, a statistically defined buffer zone
   for the positional accuracy assessment in VGI is proposed in this study.
   To facilitate practical applications, we have also developed an
   iterative method to obtain a theoretically defined buffer zone. In
   addition to the positional accuracy assessment, we have derived a
   measure of positional quality, which comprises the assessment of
   positional accuracy and the level of confidence in such assessment
   determined with respect to a statistically defined buffer zone. To
   illustrate and substantiate the theoretical arguments, both numerical
   simulations and real-life experiments are performed using OpenStreetMap.

Abstract = {{So-called prismatic 3D building models, following the level-of-detail
   (LOD) 1 of the OGC City Geography Markup Language (CityGML) standard,
   are usually generated automatically by combining building footprints
   with height values. Typically, high-resolution digital elevation models
   (DEMs) or dense LiDAR point clouds are used to generate these building
   models. However, high-resolution LiDAR data are usually not available
   with extensive coverage, whereas globally available DEM data are often
   not detailed and accurate enough to provide sufficient input to the
   modeling of individual buildings. Therefore, this paper investigates the
   possibility of generating LOD1 building models from both volunteered
   geographic information (VGI) in the form of OpenStreetMap data and
   remote sensing-derived geodata improved by multi-sensor and multi-modal
   DEM fusion techniques or produced by synthetic aperture radar
   (SAR)-optical stereogrammetry. The results of this study show several
   things: First, it can be seen that the height information resulting from
   data fusion is of higher quality than the original data sources.
   Secondly, the study confirms that simple, prismatic building models can
   be reconstructed by combining OpenStreetMap building footprints and
   easily accessible, remote sensing-derived geodata, indicating the
   potential of application on extensive areas. The building models were
   created under the assumption of flat terrain at a constant height, which
   is valid in the selected study area.}},

Journal = {{ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Transport decision-making problems are typically spatially based and
   involve a set of feasible alternatives with multiple evaluation
   criteria. Besides, transport decisions affect citizens' quality of life,
   as well as specific interests of general stakeholders (e.g., transport
   companies), thus needing a participatory approach to decision-making.
   Geographic Information Systems (GIS) have the ability to visualize
   spatial data and represent the impact of location based transport
   alternatives, thus helping experts to conduct robust assessments.
   Moreover, with the recent diffusion of Volunteered Geographic
   Information (VGI) and development of Public Participatory GIS (PPGIS)
   platforms, the process can be enhanced thanks to the collection of a
   large amount of updated spatial data and the achievement of an active
   community participation. In this study, we provide an overview based on
   a structured literature review of the use of VGI and PPGIS in transport
   studies, exploring the fields of application, role played by GIS, level
   of public involvement and decision stage at which they are applied. From
   the overview's results, we propose a general framework for the
   evaluation of transport alternatives using GIS from a multiple
   stakeholder point of view; the main conclusion is the usefulness of the

Abstract = {{The volunteered geographic information (VGI) collected in OpenStreetMap
   (OSM) has been used in many applications. Extracting multilane roads and
   establishing a high level of expressed detail play important roles in
   the field of automated cartographic generalization. An accurate and
   detailed extraction process benefits geographic analysis, urban region
   division, and road network construction, as well as transportation
   applications services. The road networks in OSM have a high level of
   detail and complex structures; however, they also include many duplicate
   lines, which degrade the efficiency and increase the difficulty of
   extracting multilane roads. To resolve these problems, this work
   proposes a machine-learning-based approach, in which the road networks
   are first converted from lines to polygons. Then, various geometric
   descriptors, including compactness, width, circularity, area, perimeter,
   complexity, parallelism, shape descriptor, and width-to-length ratio,
   are used to train a random forest (RF) classifier and identify the
   candidates. Finally, another RF is trained to evaluate the candidates
   using all the geometric descriptors and topological features; the
   outputs of this second trained RF are the predicted multilane roads. An

Abstract = {{Digital communication tools for information sharing are being
   increasingly used in governance, including green space governance and
   natural resource management and planning. Citizens' resources in the
   form of knowledge, skills, as well as their collaboration with
   authorities have been identified in the governance literature as crucial
   elements in sustainable development. Technical advancement in internet
   communication technology (ICT) presents novel opportunities for engaging
   and leveraging civic knowledge and skills into different levels of
   governance. These options are still largely unexplored in governance
   research on urban green infrastructure (UGI). In this paper, we analyse
   three different digital tools (e-tools) from the perspective of a
   Scandinavian planning context. We explore how e-tools can support UGI
   governance and the perceived barriers. The e-tools explored are three
   digital platforms with a focus on public participation related to UGI.
   The three e-tools are map-based, i.e., users share information on
   digital maps: so-called Volunteered Geographic Information. Here, we
   call them place-based e-tools.
   We explore and analyse their adoption into UGI governance, the
   institutional contexts that affect them and also discuss potential of
   e-tools in place-based governance. Our findings indicate that the
   analysed tools all facilitate UGI governance in terms of engaging
   citizens in use, management, and planning of UGI. However, there are
   challenges to be aware of, such as the digital divide and the importance
   of clear participatory frameworks. We conclude that place-based e-tools
   have potential for UGI governance and that there is potential to
   strengthen links to `place', while continuously testing and challenging
   new opportunities as technology rapidly develops.}},

Abstract = {{OpenStreetCam and Mapillary are two increasingly popular online services
   centered on providing street-level imagery through close association
   with the OpenStreetMap platform and crowdmapping community. While both
   services provide crowdsourced street-level imagery, the differences in
   their aims and operations present an opportunity to discuss the various
   ways in which commercialization dynamics and crowdmapping practices are
   reshaping each other in the geoweb. This is significant because
   crowdmapping relies on massive distributed pools of unpaid labor, and is
   often characterized by a discourse and identity of community-centered
   sharing that eschews profit-seeking as a central motive. While the use
   of OpenStreetMap by commercial products is not new, the emergence of
   crowdsourced street-level imagery is an innovation with significant
   consequences. Projects like Mapillary and OpenStreetCam have the
   potential to both change the collaborative dynamics that drive
   OpenStreetMap, and simultaneously disrupt the state of street-level
   imagery ecosystem, which has been dominated by a single private
   provider: Google Street View. In light of this, crowdourced street-level
   imagery should be assessed, not only in technical terms, but through the
   full range of its political-economic ramifications. To this end, in this
   article we examine the role of commercialization in crowdmapped
   street-level imagery through a property regimes framework. Using this
   approach, we identify, analyze, and critique the allocation of rights,
   roles, and economic value within these services, thus shedding light on

   accuracy criterion to assesses the fitness of the OSM data for producing

   monitoring and applications in environmental planning and governance.
   The literature testifies to a very rapid growth in the field, with

Abstract = {{This work addresses motivation for participating in volunteered

   the core process of a VGIS, fails to create value and its main advantage

   present a conceptual framework to assist in designing engagement
   strategies to motivate and facilitate goal-oriented participation. To
   this end, we examine the relation between Maslow's human needs and VGI,
   its different goals, and current studies on motivation. We analyze
   intrinsic and internalized motivation, focusing on the needs outlined in
   self-determination theory. Finally, we apply Vroom's expectancy theory

   efforts to motivate should be aligned with the project rationale, and an
   engagement process consisting of three main actions: Enroll, Grow and
   Retain. With this framework, future VGIS developments can have a

Abstract = {{This study presents results from an on-going social map service pilot
   that supports a national mapping agency (NMA) in data collection.
   Results from the pilot show that a VGI map service benefits both
   citizens and the NMA; the data quality is high enough to suit the needs
   of an NMA; citizens obtain a means to contribute and be involved in
   ameliorating maps. The social map service works also as a
   citizen-to-citizen communication channel as all the contributions are
   immediately visible to all users. Based on the results of this study,
   VGI should be further integrated with NMA processes in the future. One
   way of improving the integration are via services offered to both
   citizens and NMA employees that borrow features from existing social
   network services but also from popular games. Commenting, voting and
   gamification elements can be integrated with the VGI services to benefit
   both citizens and NMAs. Due to the numerous challenges of VGI the
   European national mapping agencies involvement in using citizens as data
   collectors is low. It is, however, within the NMA's grasp to develop the
   role of VGI in NMA processes further and to make VGI collection fun.}},

Abstract = {{Obtaining insights about the dynamics of urban structure is crucial to
   the framing of the context within the smart city. This paper focuses on
   urban areas of interest (UAOI), a concept that provides functional
   definitions of a city's spatial structure. Traditional sources of social
   data can rarely capture these aspects at scale while spatial information
   on the city alone does not capture how the population values different
   parts of the city and in different ways. Hence, we leverage volunteered
   geographic information (VGI) to overcome some of the limits of
   traditional sources in providing urban structural and functional
   insights. We use a special type of VGImetadata from geotagged Flickr
   imagesto identify UAOIs and exploit their temporal and spatial
   attributes. To do this, we propose a methodological strategy that
   combines hierarchical density-based spatial clustering for applications
   with noise and the -shape' algorithm to quantify the dynamics of UAOIs
   in Inner London for a period 2013-2015 and develop an innovative
   visualisation of UAOI profiles from which UAOI dynamics can be explored.
   Our results expand and improve upon the previous literature on this
   topic and provide a useful reference for urban practitioners who might

Abstract = {{Geographic data are used by United Kingdom (UK) defence for purposes
   including peacekeeping, humanitarian aid and disaster relief, and
   fighting wars. The geographic extent of defence data covers the world,
   with greater focus directed towards areas considered to be of current

   via National Mapping Agencies, but there is now increasing interest in
   the potential of crowdsourced geographic data to supplement
   authoritative data where they are not available, outdated or incomplete.
   Volunteered geographic information (VGI) and social media have the
   potential to provide this needed missing information. This paper
   presents initial work carried out in identifying the potential of
   crowdsourced geographic information in defence. We first provide a short
   description of the role of UK defence and review the existing literature
   on crowdsourced geographic information in defence, as well as generic
   VGI quality assessment methods. We then explore the potential of
   crowdsourced data in real-world applications: the conflation of VGI and
   social media with official data for effective decision-making in war
   zones, and the potential for crowdsourcing to increase effective
   collaboration between machines and humans in disaster situations. Based
   on our review, we outline specific research challenges for deploying
   crowdsourced geographic information in defence, focussing on data
   quality and fitness-for-purpose assessment. Defence-specific constraints
   include the need for rapid quality assessment processes and the need to
   communicate high-quality information effectively in situations where
   rapid decision-making is required. Ethical issues are also of

Abstract = {{The exodus of displaced populations is a recurring historical
   phenomenon, and the ongoing Syrian humanitarian crisis is its latest
   incarnation. During such mass migration events, information is an
   essential commodity. Of particular importance is geographical (e.g.,
   pathways and refugee camps) and social (e.g., refugee activities and
   networking) information. Traditionally, such information had been
   produced and disseminated by authorities, but a new paradigm is
   emerging: Web 2.0 and mobile computing technologies enable the involved
   stakeholder communities to produce, access, and consume
   migration-related information. The purpose of this article is to put
   forward a new typology for understanding the factors around migration
   and to examine the potential of crowd-generated dataespecially open data
   and volunteered geographic informationto study such events. Using the
   recent wave of migration to Europe from the Middle East and northern
   Africa as a case study, we examine how migration-related information can
   be dynamically mined and analyzed to study the migrants' pathways from
   their home countries to their destination sites, as well as the
   conditions and activities that evolve during the migration process.
   These new data sources can provide a deeper and more fine-grained
   understanding of the migration process, often in real-time, and often
   through the eyes of the communities affected by it. Nevertheless, this
   also raises significant methodological and technical challenges for
   their future use associated with potential biases, data quality issues,

   ground objects from satellite images but rely on numerous labels for
   training for each specific task. We solve this problem by fusing
   multiple freely accessible crowdsourced geographic data and propose an
   active learning-based CNN training framework named MC-CNN to deal with
   the quality issues of the labels extracted from these data, including
   incompleteness (e.g., some kinds of object are not labeled) and
   heterogeneity (e.g., different spatial granularities). The method is
   evaluated with building mapping in South Malawi and road mapping in
   Guinea with level-18 satellite images provided by Bing Map and
   volunteered geographic information from OpenStreetMap, MapSwipe, and
   OsmAnd. The results based on multiple metrics, including Precision,
   Recall, F1 Score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic

Abstract = {{Large and unofficial data sets, for instance those gathered from social
   media, are increasingly being used in geographical research and explored
   as decision support tools for policy development. Social media data have
   the potential to provide new insight into phenomena about which there is
   little information from conventional sources. Within this context, this
   paper explores the potential of social media data to evaluate the
   aesthetic management of landscape. Specifically, this project utilises
   the perceptions of visitors to the Pennine Way National Trail, which
   passes through land managed under the Environmental Stewardship Scheme
   (ESS). The method analyses sentiment in trail users' public Twitter
   messages (tweets) with the aim of assessing the extent to which the ESS
   maintains landscape character within the trail corridor. The method
   demonstrates the importance of filtering social media data to convert it
   into useful information. After filtering, the results are based on 161
   messages directly related to the trail. Although small, this sample
   illustrates the potential for social media to be used as a cheap and
   increasingly abundant source of information. We suggest that social
   media data in this context should be seen as a resource that can
   complement, rather than replace, conventional data sources such as
   questionnaires and interviews. Furthermore, we provide guidance on how
   social media could be effectively used by conservation bodies, such as
   Natural England, which are charged with the management of areas of

   developed and tested a participatory mapping methodology utilizing the
   open data catalogues and cloud computing capacity to map the previously
   unknown extent and species composition of forest plantations in the
   Southern Highlands area of Tanzania, a region experiencing a rapid
   growth of smallholder-owned woodlots. A large set of reference data,
   focusing on forest plantation coverage, species and age information
   distribution, was collected in a two-week participatory GIS campaign
   where 22 Tanzanian experts interpreted very high-resolution satellite
   images in Google Earth with the Open Foris Collect Earth tool developed
   by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. The
   collected samples were used as training data to classify a multi-sensor
   image stack of Landsat 8 (2013-2015), Sentinel-2 (2015-2016), Sentinel-1
   (2015), and SRTM derived elevation and slope data layers into a 30 m
   resolution forest plantation map in Google Earth Engine. The results
   show that the forest plantation area was estimated with high overall
   accuracy (85\%). The interpretation accuracy of local experts was high
   considering general definition of forest plantation declining with
   increased details in interpretation attributes. The results showcase the
   unique value of local expert participation, enabling the collection of
   thousands of reference samples over a large geographical area in a short
   period of time simultaneously building the capacity of the experts.
   However, sufficient training prior to the data collection is crucial for
   the interpretation success especially when detailed interpretation is
   conducted in complex landscapes. Since the methodology is built on

Abstract = {{With the unprecedented availability of satellite data and the rise of
   global binary maps, the collection of shared reference data sets should
   be fostered to allow systematic product benchmarking and validation.
   Authoritative global reference data are generally collected by experts
   with regional knowledge through photo-interpretation. During the last
   decade, crowdsourcing has emerged as an attractive alternative for rapid
   and relatively cheap data collection, beckoning the increasingly
   relevant question: can these two data sources be combined to validate
   thematic maps? In this article, we compared expert and crowd data and
   assessed their relative agreement for cropland identification, a land
   cover class often reported as difficult to map. Results indicate that
   observations from experts and volunteers could be partially conflated
   provided that several consistency checks are performed. We propose that
   conflation, i.e., replacement and augmentation of expert observations by
   crowdsourced observations, should be carried out both at the sampling
   and data analytics levels. The latter allows to evaluate the reliability
   of crowdsourced observations and to decide whether they should be
   conflated or discarded. We demonstrate that the standard deviation of
   crowdsourced contributions is a simple yet robust indicator of
   reliability which can effectively inform conflation. Following this
   criterion, we found that 70\% of the expert observations could be
   crowdsourced with little to no effect on accuracy estimates, allowing a
   strategic reallocation of the spared expert effort to increase the
   reliability of the remaining 30\% at no additional cost. Finally, we
   provide a collection of evidence-based recommendations for future hybrid
   reference data collection campaigns.}},

   repetitively and may support the formation of a cognitive map of the
   environment. In the present study, we investigated the relation between
   salience, meaningfulness and recognition performance of OpenStreetMap
   (OSM) pictograms and the potential effects of the visual complexity of
   pictograms on these usability characteristics. Salience was measured via
   eye fixations on specific pictograms, meaningfulness with an explicit
   continuous scale and recognition performance with a yes/no recognition
   memory paradigm. Statistical analyses showed that pictograms drew more
   visual attention if they were visually complex or if their meaning was
   inapprehensible or ambiguous. Less apprehensible pictograms were also
   recognized more often. Interestingly, the data indicated that longer
   fixations could lead to worse recognition performance. Long fixations on
   a pictogram may increase the likelihood of false recognition in
   subsequent situations where the pictogram is no longer valid or
   relevant. Based on the findings, we suggest balancing the meaningfulness
   and visual complexity of contiguous pictograms to enhance their
   recognition and to provide an optimal level of salience of single
   objects.}},

Title = {{A Cluster Graph Approach to Land Cover Classification Boosting}},
Journal = {{DATA}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 10}},
Abstract = {{When it comes to land cover classification, the process of deriving the
   land classes is complex due to possible errors in algorithms,
   spatio-temporal heterogeneity of the Earth observation data, variation
   in availability and quality of reference data, or a combination of
   these. This article proposes a probabilistic graphical model approach,
   in the form of a cluster graph, to boost geospatial classifications and
   produce a more accurate and robust classification and uncertainty
   product. Cluster graphs can be characterized as a means of reasoning
   about geospatial data such as land cover classifications by considering
   the effects of spatial distribution, and inter-class dependencies in a
   computationally efficient manner. To assess the capabilities of our
   proposed cluster graph boosting approach, we apply it to the field of
   land cover classification. We make use of existing land cover products
   (GlobeLand30, CORINE Land Cover) along with data from Volunteered
   Geographic Information (VGI), namely OpenStreetMap (OSM), to generate a
   boosted land cover classification and the respective uncertainty
   estimates. Our approach combines qualitative and quantitative components
   through the application of our probabilistic graphical model and
   subjective expert judgments. Evaluating our approach on a test region in
   Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, our approach was able to boost the
   overall land cover classification accuracy by 1.4\% when compared to an
   independent reference land cover dataset. Our approach was shown to be
   robust and was able to produce a diverse, feasible and spatially
   consistent land cover classification in areas of incomplete and
   conflicting evidence. On an independent validation scene, we
   demonstrated that our cluster graph boosting approach was generalizable
   even when initialized with poor prior assumptions.}},

   10 years have been analysed, showing a predominance of cycling
   activities on trails of up to 50 km in length. Using cluster analysis
   and a hotspot approach, we found that the highest intensities of use are
   concentrated in less than 1\% of the area studied, while a high
   dispersion of track start/finish points suggests low but scattered
   pressure all over the site. Spatial analysis reveals a number of spatial
   interactions, including the use of official trails, trespassing on
   reserves and potential nuisance to birdlife. This information is useful
   for site managers and helps them design sustainable practices. By
   applying the same analysis using VGI and data mining to other Natura

Abstract = {{The number of applications associated with OpenStreetMap (OSM), one of

   `up-to-date'. However, limited by the ability of the providers, the

   on how to assess the quality of OSM via deep learning and
   high-resolution remote imagery. First, considering that high-resolution
   remote sensing imagery is clear enough for recognizing buildings, we
   proposed using multi-task deep-convolutional networks to extract
   buildings in pixel level. The extracted buildings were converted into
   polygons with geographical coordinates, which were treated as reference
   data. Then, OSM footprint data were matched with the reference data.
   Quality was assessed in terms of both positional accuracy and data
   completeness. Finally, the building footprint data of OSM for the city
   of Las Vegas, Nevada, USA, were evaluated. The experiments show that the
   proposed method can assess OSM effectively and accurately. The results
   show that building extracted by the proposed method can be treated as a
   new data source for assessing OSM quality and can also be used for urban
   planning in regions where OSM lacks building data.}},

Abstract = {{Geographic Information Systems (GIS) can serve as a planning tool to
   promote community health at many levels, such as the policy,
   organizational and public levels. The Brownfields to Healthfields (B2H)
   program involves creating new opportunities to support community public
   health, including the development of park spaces and new hospital
   facilities. However, there was no existing portal for organizations to
   access a map of brownfields data to meet the required criteria of the
   organization in seeking a space for transformation to a
   ``healthfield{''} or other public services facility. Since the various
   types of community and demographic data were scattered, it was necessary
   to combine the data in a web application available to all stakeholders.
   This paper discusses the utilization of a new concept of operation,
   which includes participative and volunteered approaches that are
   addressed to include the contribution of various stakeholder groups, and
   to further improve planning for public health.}},

Abstract = {{Crowdsourcing geographic information has been a massive phenomenon that
   look place over the last two decades and that changed dramatically the
   diffusion of geographic data in society. The availability and readiness
   of geographic information is paramount in practically all software
   systems and services and this is strongly determined by the drive of
   people putting energy in data collection and improvement. Understanding
   the motivations of people to participate in this process is fundamental
   to leverage the design of new systems able to increase satisfaction and
   productivity. The introduction of game mechanisms in geographic
   crowdsourcing is the theme that we face in this research. The so-called
   gamification of applications has been widely used as a stimulant for
   involving people in serious activities that are hidden behind the gaming
   facade. Cooperation and competition are key factors that are promoted
   through the game. We synthesize a conceptual model that collects the
   main gaming techniques tailored for geographic data and that is the
   basis for the development of a gamification library. As a proof of
   concept, we deploy an Android app for geometric data collection inside
   buildings and test it in a university setting.}},

Abstract = {{Number of studies covering major data aspects of OpenStreetMap (OSM) for

   However, this is not the case for developing ones mainly because of low
   data availability in OSM. This study presents a time-series spatial
   analysis of Turkey OSM dataset, a developing country, between the year
   2007 and 2015 to understand how the dataset has developed with time and
   space. Five different socio-economic factors of the region are tested to
   find their relationship, if any, with dataset growth. An east-west
   spatial trend in data density is observed within the country. Population
   Density and Literacy Level of the region are found be the factors
   controlling it. It has also been observed that the street network of the
   region has followed the Exploration and Densification evolutionary
   model. High participation inequality is found within the OSM mappers,
   with only 5 of them responsible for the country's 50\% geo-data upload.
   Furthermore, it is found that these mappers use other Volunteered
   Geographic Information (VGI) and government open-dataset to feed into

   Understanding how cyclists travel and how to encourage cycling requires

   we use data from the activity tracking app Strava to examine where

   the data by comparing the observed link flows to the link flows which
   would have resulted if people took the shortest route. Comparing these
   flows gives some expected results, for example, that people like to
   cycle along the river, as well as some unexpected results, for example,
   that some routes with cycling infrastructure are avoided by cyclists.

   where, due to high traffic, potential conflicts between different user

   mountain forest districts located in the Sudetes Mountains: Szklarska
   Poreba and Swieradow, which due to their tourist values and an extensive
   network of hiking and cycling trails arouse society's interest. In the
   area, 2896 unique activities divided into cycling, running and hiking
   were registered. It was shown that 7.3\% of the length of routes used by
   pedestrians, 13.6\% of the length of routes for runners and 11.0\% of
   the length of routes for cyclists are characterized by high intensity of
   traffic, while 30.3\%, 28.4\% and 37.7\% of routes for the indicated
   groups, respectively, are characterized by medium intensity of traffic.
   On other routes, low intensity of utilization was observed. Existing
   hiking and cycling trails were pointed out as the most frequently used
   routes. The specially designed bicycle routes, the so-called `Single

   data can be used to monitor traffic in forest areas and constitute one
   of the elements of the decision support system (DSS). A certain weakness
   of VGI data from the sports applications used in this study could be the
   lack of the possibility of creating user profiles. Consequently that

Abstract = {{OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a free map that can be created, edited, and
   updated by volunteers globally. The quality of OSM datasets is therefore
   of great concern. Extensive studies have focused on assessing the
   completeness (a quality measure) of OSM datasets in various countries,
   but very few have been paid attention to investigating the OSM building
   dataset in China. This study aims to present an analysis of the
   evolution, completeness and spatial patterns of OSM building data in
   China across the years 2012 to 2017. This is done using two quality
   indicators, OSM building count and OSM building density, although a
   corresponding reference dataset for the whole country is not freely
   available. Development of OSM building counts from 2012 to 2017 is
   analyzed in terms of provincial- and prefecture-level divisions. Factors
   that may affect the development of OSM building data in China are also
   analyzed. A 1 x 1 km(2) regular grid is overlapped onto urban areas of
   each prefecture-level division, and the OSM building density of each
   grid cell is calculated. Spatial distributions of high-density grid
   cells for prefecture-level divisions are analyzed. Results show that:
   (1) the OSM building count increases by almost 20 times from 2012 to
   2017, and in most cases, economic (gross domestic product) and OSM road
   length are two factors that may influence the development of OSM
   building data in China; (2) most grid cells in urban areas do not have
   any building data, but two typical patterns (dispersion and aggregation)
   of high-density grid cells are found among prefecture-level divisions.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study is to evaluate operational methods for
   creating a particular type of urban vegetation map-one focused on
   vegetation over rooftops (VOR), specifically trees that extend over
   urban residential buildings. A key constraint was the use of passive
   remote sensing data only. To achieve this, we (1) conduct a review of
   the urban remote sensing vegetation classification literature, and we
   then (2) discuss methods to derive a detailed map of VOR for a study
   area in Calgary, Alberta, Canada from a late season, high-resolution
   airborne orthomosaic based on an integration of Geographic Object-Based
   Image Analysis (GEOBIA), pre-classification filtering of image-objects
   using Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI), and a machine learning
   classifier. Pre-classification filtering lowered the computational
   burden of classification by reducing the number of input objects by
   14\%. Accuracy assessment results show that, despite the presence of
   senescing vegetation with low vegetation index values and deep shadows,
   classification using a small number of image-object spectral attributes
   as classification features (n = 9) had similar overall accuracy (88.5\%)
   to a much more complex classification (91.8\%) comprising a
   comprehensive set of spectral, texture, and spatial attributes as
   classification features (n = 86). This research provides an example of
   the very specific questions answerable about precise urban locations
   using a combination of high-resolution passive imagery and freely
   available VGI data. It highlights the benefits of pre-classification
   filtering and the judicious selection of features from image-object
   attributes to reduce processing load without sacrificing classification

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Air quality has had a significant impact on public health, the
   environment and eventually on the economy of countries for decades.
   Effectively mitigating air pollution in urban areas necessitates
   accurate air quality exposure information. Recent advancements in sensor
   technology and the increasing popularity of volunteered geographic
   information (VGI) open up new possibilities for air quality exposure
   assessment in cities. However, citizens and their sensors are put in
   areas deemed to be subjectively of interest (e.g., where citizens live,
   school of their kids or working spaces), and this leads to missed
   opportunities when it comes to optimal air quality exposure assessment.
   In addition, while the current literature on VGI has extensively
   discussed data quality and citizen engagement issues, few works, if any,
   offer techniques to fine-tune VGI contributions for an optimal air
   quality exposure assessment. This article presents and tests an approach
   to minimise land use regression prediction errors on citizen-contributed
   data. The approach was evaluated using a dataset (N = 116 sensors) from
   the city of Stuttgart, Germany. The comparison between the existing
   network design and the combination of locations selected by the
   optimisation method has shown a drop in spatial mean prediction error by
   52\%. The ideas presented in this article are useful for the systematic
   deployment of VGI air quality sensors, and can aid in the creation of
   higher resolution, more realistic maps for air quality monitoring in

   these maps were compared to unmodified maps. Eye movement analyses
   revealed that in the reduced maps, areas offside the route were fixated
   less often. Route recognition performance was not affected by the map

Abstract = {{Detecting events using social media data is important for timely
   emergency response and urban monitoring. Current studies primarily use
   semantic-based methods, in which bursts of certain semantic signals are
   detected to identify emerging events. Nevertheless, our consideration is
   that a social event will not only affect semantic signals but also cause
   irregular human mobility patterns. By introducing depictive features,
   such irregular patterns can be used for event detection. Consequently,
   in this paper, we develop a novel, comprehensive workflow for event
   detection by mining the geographical patterns of VGI. This workflow
   first uses data geographical topic modeling to detect the hashtag
   communities with VGI semantic data. Both global and local indicators are
   then constructed by introducing spatial autocorrelation measurements. We
   then adopt an outlier test and generate indicator maps to
   spatiotemporally identify the potential social events. This workflow was
   implemented using a real-world dataset (104,000 geo-tagged photos) and
   the evaluation was conducted both qualitatively and quantitatively. A
   set of experiments showed that the discovered semantic communities were
   internally consistent and externally differentiable, and the
   plausibility of the detected events was demonstrated by referring to the
   available ground truth. This study examined the feasibility of detecting
   events by investigating the geographical patterns of social media data

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The increasing availability of volunteered geographic information (VGI)
   enables novel studies in many scientific domains. However, inconsistent
   VGI can negatively affect these studies. This paper describes a workflow
   that checks the consistency of Volunteered Phenological Observations
   (VPOs) while considering the synchrony of observations (i.e., the
   temporal dispersion of a phenological event). The geographic
   coordinates, day of the year (DOY) of the observed event, and the
   accumulation of daily temperature until that DOY were used to: (1)
   spatially group VPOs by connecting observations that are near to each
   other, (2) define consistency constraints, (3) check the consistency of
   VPOs by evaluating the defined constraints, and (4) optimize the
   constraints by analysing the effect of inconsistent VPOs on the
   synchrony models derived from the observations. This workflow was tested
   using VPOs collected in the Netherlands during the period 2003-2015. We
   found that the average percentage of inconsistent observations was low
   to moderate (ranging from 1\% for wood anemone and pedunculate oak to
   15\% for cow parsley species). This indicates that volunteers provide
   reliable phenological information. We also found a significant
   correlation between the standard deviation of DOY of the observed events
   and the accumulation of daily temperature (with correlation coefficients
   ranging from 0.78 for lesser celandine, and 0.60 for pedunculate oak).
   This confirmed that colder days in late winter and early spring lead to
   synchronous flowering and leafing onsets. Our results highlighted the
   potential of synchrony information and geographical context for checking
   the consistency of phenological VGI. Other domains using VGI can adapt
   this geocomputational workflow to check the consistency of their data,

Abstract = {{Reporting on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is complex given
   the wide variety of governmental and NGO actors involved in development
   projects as well as the increased number of targets and indicators.
   However, data on the wide variety of indicators must be collected
   regularly, in a robust manner, comparable across but also within
   countries and at different administrative and disaggregated levels for
   adequate decision making to take place. Traditional census and household
   survey data is not enough. The increase in Small and Big Data streams
   have the potential to complement official statistics. The purpose of
   this research is to develop and evaluate a framework to characterize a
   data ecosystem in a developing country in its totality and to show how
   this can be used to identify data, outside the official statistics
   realm, that enriches the reporting on SDG indicators. Our method
   consisted of a literature study and an interpretative case study (two
   workshops with 60 and 35 participants and including two questionnaires,
   over 20 consultations and desk research). We focused on SDG 6.1.1.
   (Proportion of population using safely managed drinking water services)
   in rural Malawi. We propose a framework with five dimensions (actors,
   data supply, data infrastructure, data demand and data ecosystem
   governance). Results showed that many governmental and NGO actors are
   involved in water supply projects with different funding sources and
   little overall governance. There is a large variety of geospatial data
   sharing platforms and online accessible information management systems
   with however a low adoption due to limited internet connectivity and low
   data literacy. Lots of data is still not open. All this results in an
   immature data ecosystem. The characterization of the data ecosystem
   using the framework proves useful as it unveils gaps in data at
   geographical level and in terms of dimensionality (attributes per water
   point) as well as collaboration gaps. The data supply dimension of the
   framework allows identification of those datasets that have the right
   quality and lowest cost of data extraction to enrich official
   statistics. Overall, our analysis of the Malawian case study illustrated
   the complexities involved in achieving self-regulation through
   interaction, feedback and networked relationships. Additional
   complexities, typical for developing countries, include fragmentation,
   divide between governmental and non-governmental data activities,
   complex funding relationships and a data poor context.}},

Abstract = {{Subjective risk perception during urban cycling has been mostly

   using both opportunistically available crowd-sourced data (i.e.,
   volunteered geographic information or VGI) as well as more established
   but rarely investigated authoritative data as predictors of subjective
   cycling risk. We achieve this by correlating indicators of cycling risk
   extracted from both VGI and authoritative data for two different German
   cities with participants' risk estimates assessed in laboratory-based
   virtual reality experiments. In Case 1, 15 participants (mostly
   undergraduate students with a mean age of 22 years old; nine of them

   evidence that parameters extracted from VGI (e.g., the semantic severity

   authoritative data sources (e.g., accident statistics or Space Syntax
   measures) represent valid indicators for the subjectively perceived risk

   check-in visits, using multiple linear regressions. Despite potential
   biases in the use of social media data, using a park typology, we found
   that the number of visits was significantly different among different
   types of parks. While cultural relics parks and large urban parks had
   larger numbers of visits, neighborhood parks had higher visitation rates
   per unit of area. Park size and entrance fees were associated with
   increased numbers of visits for all types of parks. For parks that
   mainly serve local residents, the distance to urban center significantly

Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1550-1572}},

Abstract = {{OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a free global map dataset that was created by
   volunteers around the world. This inevitably means that there are a
   number of quality issues with the final OSM product, however. Extensive
   research has therefore been carried out to assess the quality of this
   product by applying a range of measures versus reference datasets, but
   little effort to date has been focused on quantitative quality
   estimation without reference datasets. The aim of this study is
   therefore to quantitatively estimate the completeness of street blocks
   in an OSM dataset. This was accomplished by initially exploring the
   relationship between geometric indicators (i.e., area, perimeter, and
   density) and street block completeness in an OSM road dataset, before
   these relationships were applied to quantitatively estimate completeness
   in other datasets. The results of this study show that: (1) street block
   completeness is positively correlated with density and negatively
   correlated with area and perimeter; and (2) in most cases, estimated
   completeness values for all street blocks within an OSM road dataset do

Abstract = {{Gridded time series of climatic variables are key inputs to phenological
   models used to generate spatially continuous indices and explore the
   influence of climate variability and change on plant development at
   broad scales. To date, there have been few efforts to evaluate how the
   particular source and spatial resolution (i.e., scale) of the input data
   might affect how phenological models and associated indices track
   variations and shifts at the continental scale. This study represents
   the first such assessment, based on cloud computing and volunteered
   phenological observations. It focuses on established extended spring
   indices (SI-x) that estimate day of year (DOY) for first leaf (FL)
   emergence and first bloom (FB) emergence in plants particularly
   sensitive to accumulation of warmth in early to mid-spring. We compared
   and validated gridded SI-x products obtained using Daymet (at 1, 4, 35,
   and 100 km spatial resolution) and gridMET (at 4, 35, and 100 km)
   temperature data. These products were used to estimate temporal trends
   in DOY for FL and FB in the coterminous United States (CONUS) from 1980
   to 2016. The SI-x products, and their resulting patterns and trends
   across CONUS, affected more by the source of input data than their
   spatial resolution. SI-x estimates DOY of FL and FB are about 3 and 4
   weeks more accurate, respectively, using Daymet than gridMET. This leads
   to significant differences, and even contradictory, rates of change in
   DOY driven by Daymet versus gridMET temperatures, even though both data
   sources exhibit advancement in DOY of FL and FB across most regions in
   CONUS. SI-x products generated from gridMET poorly estimate the timing
   of spring onset, whereas Daymet SI-x products and actual volunteered
   observations are moderately correlated (r = 0.7). Daymet better captures
   temperature regimes, particularly in the western United States, and is
   more appropriate for generating high-resolution SI-x indices at
   continental scale.}},

Abstract = {{Many datasets nowadays contain links between geographic locations and
   natural language texts. These links can be geotags, such as geotagged
   tweets or geotagged Wikipedia pages, in which location coordinates are
   explicitly attached to texts. These links can also be place mentions,
   such as those in news articles, travel blogs, or historical archives, in
   which texts are implicitly connected to the mentioned places. This kind
   of data is referred to as geo-text data. The availability of large
   amounts of geo-text data brings both challenges and opportunities. On
   the one hand, it is challenging to automatically process this kind of
   data due to the unstructured texts and the complex spatial footprints of
   some places. On the other hand, geo-text data offers unique research
   opportunities through the rich information contained in texts and the
   special links between texts and geography. As a result, geo-text data
   facilitates various studies especially those in data-driven geospatial
   semantics. This paper discusses geo-text data and related concepts. With
   a focus on data-driven research, this paper systematically reviews a
   large number of studies that have discovered multiple types of knowledge

Abstract = {{There is an increase in the awareness of the importance of spatial data
   in epidemiology and exposure assessment (EA) studies. Most studies use
   governmental and ordnance surveys, which are often expensive and

   Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) mapping project. Yet very few
   environmental epidemiological and EA studies have used OSM as a source
   for road data. Since VGI data is either noncommercial or governmental,
   the validity of OSM is often questioned. We investigate the robustness
   and validity of OSM data for use in epidemiological and EA studies. We
   compared OSM and Governmental Major Road Data (GRD) in three different
   regions: Massachusetts, USA; Bern, Switzerland; and Beer-Sheva, South
   Israel. The comparison was done by calculating data completeness,
   positional accuracy, and EA using traditional exposure methods. We found
   that OSM data is fairly complete and accurate in all regions. The
   results in all regions were robust, with Massachusetts showing the best
   fits (R-2 0.93). Results in Bern (R-2 0.78) and Beer-Sheva (R-2 0.77)

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In this work, we present a system that generates customized pedestrian
   routes entirely based on data from OpenStreetMap (OSM). The system
   enables users to define to what extent they would like the route to have
   green areas (e.g., parks, squares, trees), social places (e.g., cafes,
   restaurants, shops) and quieter streets (i.e., with less road traffic).
   We present how the greenness, sociability, and quietness factors are
   defined and extracted from OSM as well as how they are integrated into a
   routing cost function. We intrinsically evaluate customized routes from
   one-thousand trips, i.e., origin-destination pairs, and observe that
   these are, in general, as we intended-slightly longer but significantly
   more social, greener, and quieter than the respective shortest routes.
   Based on a survey taken by 156 individuals, we also evaluate the
   system's usefulness, usability, controlability, and transparency. The
   majority of the survey participants agree that the system is useful and
   easy to use and that it gives them the feeling of being in control
   regarding the extraction of routes in accordance with their greenness,

   limited quality and quantity and generated building maps for a 50,000
   km(2) area. Resulting maps are in strong agreement with existing
   settlement maps and require a fraction of the manual input needed for
   the latter. The VGI-based maps will provide support across multiple

Abstract = {{Quantitative approximations of community-level recovery are a mainstay

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{72}},
Pages = {{42-56}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Integrating updates from timely sources such as volunteered geographic
   information (VGI) into the spatial data maintained at official agencies
   is becoming a more demanding requirement but presents many challenges.
   This paper proposes an approach to addressing the technical challenge of
   propagating updates from timely sources (e.g. OpenStreetMap) to spatial
   data maintained at separate map scales. The main idea is to establish a
   multiple representation database (MRDB) for datasets at different scales
   and time to facilitate incremental update, where linkages between
   corresponding objects at different datasets are made explicit. First,
   two ways in which the timely sources can be integrated into official
   data for incremental update are discussed. To derive the linkages
   between different datasets, a data matching procedure based on computer
   vision is presented and fine-tuned to match data in different scale
   ranges. Furthermore, the generalization history used to produce smaller
   scale data from the larger ones in official data is inferred based on
   the linkages, and is then used to guide the update propagation. Finally,
   a framework for incremental generalization in MRDBs is proposed, where
   crucial issues like strategies for update propagation, cartographic
   generalization, and the so-called `chain reaction' are addressed. The
   framework is implemented as a fully automated process where operators
   like simplification, enlargement, compression, displacement and
   typification are incorporated into the incremental update process. By
   testing the framework against real world data sets (i.e. OpenStreetMap
   and official data at 1:10k, 1:50k and 1:100k), we show that the updates
   are integrated consistently into existing data in terms of spatial
   relations and cartographic quality. Our work suggests that making use of
   timely sources by official mapping agencies and companies in a
   continuous or event-driven data update is technically feasible, with
   further improvement and extensions discussed.}},

   Daiichi power plant nuclear accident.
   The methodology performs a series of interpolations between the U.S.
   government and contributed datasets at specific temporal windows and at
   corresponding spatial locations. The coefficients found for all the
   different temporal windows are aggregated and interpolated using
   quadratic regressions to generate a time dependent calibration function.
   Normal background radiation, decay rates, and missing values are taken
   into account during the analysis.
   Results show that the standard Safecast static transformation function
   overestimates the official measurements because it fails to capture the
   presence of two different Cesium isotopes and their changing magnitudes
   with time. A model is created to predict the ratio of the isotopes from
   the time of the accident through 2020. The proposed time dependent
   calibration takes into account this Cesium isotopes ratio, and it is
   shown to reduce the error between U.S. government and contributed data.
   The proposed calibration is needed through 2020, after which date the
   errors introduced by ignoring the presence of different isotopes will
   become negligible.}},

Abstract = {{Practitioners bemoan lack of data as one of the biggest obstacles to
   progress towards global sustainable development goals. This paper
   explores a scaled-up participatory method developed by YouthMappers, for
   creating missing geospatial data derived from remotely sensed imagery in
   order to contribute to persistent data needs in the context of the
   United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We explore the
   application of this method to a case related to SDG 3 on Health. We
   document how our approach centered on creating a global academic network
   designed to engage and empower university students and their faculty
   mentors to participate in broader efforts to create open, free spatial
   data on open platforms to inform humanitarian and development objectives
   outlined by the funding agency, the United States Agency for
   International Development (USAID). This approach expressly links supply
   and demand for geospatial knowledge by connecting specific needs for
   geographic information to specific development objectives in targeted
   places where USAID works to end extreme poverty. We discuss the
   rationale and context for the methodology as it draws from and builds
   upon prominent literature of participatory GIS (PGIS) and volunteered
   geographic information (VGI). We demonstrate how the mapping of building
   and road infrastructure in Mozambique and Kenya was carried out in order
   to provide information for an insecticide spray campaign to prevent
   malaria and protect public health. Throughout these efforts, steps are
   taken to ensure spatial data quality and to offer opportunities for
   youth volunteer embeddedness in mapping tasks and themes in places where
   students otherwise would not engage with real world data or connect with
   peers from different countries. We reflect on the opportunities and
   challenges for how this scaled-up ``remote participatory sensing{''}
   approach to spatial data creation can inform development projects in the
   context of the SDGs.}},

Abstract = {{There is evidence that the toll of death and destruction caused by
   natural hazards is rising. This is often ascribed to the impact of
   climate change that resulted in an increased frequency of extreme
   meteorological events. As a consequence, it is realistic to expect that
   the casualties and damages caused by floods will increase in the near
   future. Advanced weather forecast is a fundamental tool to predict the
   occurrence of floods and structural mitigation measures are crucial for
   flood protection. However, these strategies should be associate with
   tools to promote and increase natural-disaster awareness and
   nonstructural mitigation measures in the exposed population. To bridge
   this gap, we coupled innovative, ICT-based technologies with
   crowdsourcing. The idea is to exploit geospatial data gathered by
   citizens and volunteers with their own devices such as mobile phones to
   provide authorities with relevant information in case of flood
   emergencies. This paper describes the design and testing of an Android
   application named MAppERS (Mobile Applications for Emergency Response
   and Support), thought to enhance active participation and response of
   the population in territorial and flood-risk mitigation in
   Frederikssund, Denmark. The results of the piloting fully validate
   MAppERS as an effective tool to support the decision-making process

   textual stories, locations, and images can be acquired via portable
   devices. These data are georeferenced and presented to the public via
   web-mapping. Using photogrammetric modelling, acquired images are used
   to reconstruct heritage structures or artefacts into 3D digital models,
   which are then visualized on the SOCH web interface to enable public
   interaction. This end-to-end system incubates an online virtual

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The fact that an increasing number of people and local authorities are
   affected by natural hazards, especially floods, highlights the necessity
   of adequate mitigation and preparedness within disaster management. Many
   governments, though, have only insufficient monetary or technological
   capacities. One possible approach to tackle these issues is the
   acquisition of information by sketch maps complemented by
   questionnaires, which allows to digitally capture flood risk perception.
   We investigate which factors influence information collected by sketch
   maps and questionnaires in case studies in an area prone to pluvial
   flooding in Santiago de Chile. Our aim is to gain more information about
   the methods applied. Hereby, we focus on the spatial acquisition scale
   of sketch maps and personal characteristics of the participants, for
   example, whether they live at this very location of the survey
   (residents) or are pedestrians passing by. Our results show that the
   choice of the acquisition scale of the base map influences the amount
   and level of detail of information captured via sketch maps. Thus,
   detail base maps lead to more precise results when compared to reference
   data, especially in the case of residents. The results also reveal that
   the place of living of the respondents has an effect on the resulting
   information because on the neighborhood level the risk perception of
   residents is more detailed than the one of pedestrians. The study
   suggests that the integration of citizens via sketch maps can provide
   information about flood risk perception, and thus can influence the
   flood mitigation in the area.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims to put forth a new method to study the sociospatial

   restaurant ambience can be good indicators of socioeconomic status of
   the ambient population in different neighborhoods. To this end, we use
   Yelp user reviews to distinguish different neighborhoods in terms of
   their food purchases and identify resultant boundaries in 10 North

   well as a limited number of user check-ins and rating in those cities.
   We use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to select a set of
   potential features pertaining to food, drink and ambience from Yelp user
   comments for each geolocated restaurant. We then select those features
   which determine one's choice of restaurant and the rating that he/she

   identify neighborhoods where similar taste is practiced. We show that
   neighborhoods identified through our method show statistically

Abstract = {{Recent incremental trends in environmental pollutants alongside garbage
   disposals and wastes have undoubtedly affected the global visage of
   coastal areas. High population density, in conjunction with numerous
   tourists who visit coastal regions along with wastewater from factories,
   industrial centers, cities, agricultural activities, especially oil
   contaminants, are amongst major contributors to pollution in coastal
   areas. Fortunately, developing countries have recently instigated
   developmental procedures with the participation of the general public in
   an effort to protect the environment. Thus, one can perceive the
   importance of creating an appropriate system, which facilitates public
   participation in monitoring coastal environments. Such a system would
   notably provide solutions for many issues of pollution management in
   coastal regions. The purpose of this study is to design and implement a
   Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI)-based system through
   integration of concepts and methods from three areas of Geographic
   Information System (GIS), coastal pollution management, and public
   participation in order to monitor coastal pollution. After the
   implementation phase, Nowshahr port city, Mazandaran Province, Iran, was
   selected as the study area, wherein tourists, residents, and other
   present individuals were asked to report observable pollutants at their
   location. After a 3 day monitoring of coastal regions, 98 reports were
   registered in the system, indicating high amounts of contamination
   within the respective coastal area. 86\% of the total recorded reports
   were accounts of accumulation of garbage and other dispersed solid
   material such as foliage and tree trunks, which were somehow the main
   source of pollution. 10\% and 4\% of the remaining reports were related
   to the wastewater pollution and oil contaminants, respectively.
   According to survey results, 74\% of users were satisfied with ease of
   use and performance of system (26\% voted very good and 48\% voted good)
   amongst whom 67\% noted the system as an advantageous and effective tool
   for monitoring the coastal pollution (31\% cases of very good and 36\%
   cases of good).}},

   performance in a number of large test areas and thereby has been
   successfully utilized for the real-world data production in the area of

Volume = {{77}},
Pages = {{402-411}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Developing countries, especially in Africa are faced with a lack of
   formally registered land. Available limited records are outdated,
   inaccurate and unreliable, which makes it a challenge to properly
   administer and manage land and its resources. In the face of such
   problems, a large proportion of the population in developing countries
   depends on land and its resources for their sustenance. Developing
   countries are unable to adopt traditional land administration systems
   (LAS) due to their lack of capacity and financial constraints.
   Traditional LAS are characterised by expensive licence fees, procedures,
   and maintenance structures which are not feasible in developing
   countries. Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) has the potential to
   address these challenges by providing timely, affordable, up-to-date,
   flexible, and fit for purpose (FFP) land information to support the
   limited current systems. This paper investigates major aspects of
   developing a conceptual participatory framework for a FFP land
   administration based on VGI, and conducts a case study in how the system
   can be applied in local processes, in the context of customary land
   tenure system in Botswana. The aspects were successfully implemented in
   the case study area to demonstrate their applicability and roles they
   could play in ensuring that VGI is reliable and conforms to the legal
   and institutional regulations of Land Boards. It has further provided an
   understanding of how VGI can be collected, assessed, and utilized at
   Land Boards to improve key land transactions on a FFP basis.
   Furthermore, innovative approaches to Trust and Reputation Modelling
   (TRM) are presented, minimising the need for ground-truthing of VGI

Journal = {{ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{OpenStreetMap (OSM) is currently the largest openly licensed collection
   of geospatial data, widely used in many projects as an alternative to or
   integrated with authoritative data. One of the main criticisms against
   this dataset is that, being a collaborative product created mainly by
   citizens without formal qualifications, its quality has not been
   assessed and therefore its usage can be questioned for some
   applications. This paper provides a map matching method to check the
   spatial accuracy of the building footprint layer, based on a comparison
   with a reference dataset. Moreover, from the map matching and a
   similarity check, buildings can be detected and therefore an index of
   completeness can also be computed. This process has been applied in
   Lombardy, a region in Northern Italy, covering an area of 23,900 km(2)
   and comprising respectively about 1 million buildings in OSM and 2.8
   million buildings in the authoritative dataset. The results of the
   comparison show that the positional accuracy of the OSM buildings is at
   least compatible with the quality of the reference dataset at the scale
   of 1:5000 since the average deviation, with respect to the authoritative
   map, is below the expected tolerance of 3 m. The analysis of
   completeness, given in terms of the number of buildings appearing in the
   authoritative dataset and not present in OSM, shows an average
   percentage in the whole region equal to 57\%. However, worth noting that
   the opposite, namely the number of buildings in OSM and not in the
   reference dataset, is not zero, but corresponds to 9\%. The OSM building
   map can therefore be considered to be a valid base map for direct use
   (territorial frameworks, map navigation, urban analysis, etc.) and for
   derived use (background for the production of thematic maps) in all
   those cases where an accuracy corresponding to 1:5000 is required.
   Moreover it could be used for integrating the authoritative map at this
   scale (or smaller) where it is not complete and a rigorous quality
   certification in terms of metric precision is not required.}},

   a comprehensive list of relevant geospatial datasets, using uniquely
   designed meta-layers and feature catalogues. Moreover, we argue that
   these geospatial data can be collected and mapped by the local
   communities, through participatory approaches, thus not relying on
   authoritative engagement and data. This will contribute to the
   empowerment of communities, making them relevant stakeholders with
   valued contribution to the process. This paper outlines preliminary work
   related to concepts and ideas, whereas future work is planned to develop
   an elaborate and comprehensive GIS model, and conduct further spatial
   analysis in the framework of a small scale campaign.}},

Abstract = {{The most recent Global Slavery Index estimates that there are 40.3
   million people enslaved globally. The UN's Agenda 2030 for Sustainable
   Development Goal number 8, section 8.7 specifically refers to the issue
   of forced labour: ending modern slavery and human trafficking, including
   child labour, in all forms by 2025. Although there is a global political
   commitment to ending slavery, one of the biggest barriers to doing so is
   having reliable and timely, spatially explicit and scalable data on
   slavery activity. The lack of these data compromises evidence-based
   action and policy formulation. Thus, to meet the challenge of ending
   modern slavery new and innovative approaches, with an emphasis on
   efficient use of resources (including financial) are needed. This paper
   demonstrates the fundamental role of remote sensing as a source of
   evidence. We provide an estimate of the number of brick kilns across the
   `Brick Belt' that runs across south Asia. This is important because
   these brick kilns are known sites of modern-day slavery. This paper
   reports the first rigorous estimate of the number of brick kilns present
   and does so using a robust method that can be easily adopted by key
   agencies for evidence-based action (i.e. NGOs, etc.) and is based on
   freely available and accessible remotely sensed data. From this estimate
   we can not only calculate the scale of the slavery problem in the Brick
   Belt, but also calculate the impact of slavery beyond that of the
   enslaved people themselves, on, for example, environmental change and
   impacts on ecosystem services this links to other Sustainable
   Development Goals. As the process of achieving key Sustainable
   Development Goal targets will show, there are global benefits to ending
   slavery - this will mean a better world for everyone: safer, greener,
   more prosperous, and more equal. This is termed here a Freedom Dividend.

Abstract = {{Flood inundation probability is critical for situation awareness, flood
   mitigation, emergency response, and postevent damage assessment. Current
   flood inundation mapping approaches can be categorized into real-time
   (RT) and near-RT (NRT) processes based on the timing of data
   acquisition. However, the intrinsic limitations of each category largely
   hamper their applications for flood mapping. Taking the 2015 South
   Carolina flood in downtown Columbia as a case study, this paper proposes
   a flood inundation reconstruction model by enhancing the NRT normalized
   difference water index (NDWI) derived from remote sensing imagery with
   the RT data including stream gauge readings and social media (tweets).
   Splitting into three modules: water height module, global enhancement
   module, and local enhancement module, the proposed model first
   incorporates the gauge readings and the NDWI image to reconstruct a
   macroscale flood probability layer, which is then locally enhanced using
   the verified flood-related tweets. The final output of the model matches
   well with the U.S. Geological Survey inundation map and its surveyed
   high-water marks. Results suggest that by enhancing NRT imagery with RT
   data sources, the proposed flood inundation probability reconstruction
   model renders a more robust, spatially enhanced flood probability index
   for emergency responders to quickly identify areas in need of urgent
   attention.}},

Abstract = {{Volunteered geographic information (VGI) has fundamentally changed the
   way in which geoinformation is generated, distributed and handled. It
   entails manifold practices and discourses which are currently
   investigated from both affirmative and critical perspectives. Expanding
   on the range of theoretical approaches to VGI, this article explores the
   condition and the limits of VGI from a social theory perspective to
   explore the following questions: what is the basic structure of VGI both
   as a form of practice and a form of knowledge? What are aspects of
   integration and aspects of divergence with regard to VGI practices? Are
   there inherent limitations to VGI practices especially with regard to
   its emancipatory and educational potential? To approach these issues
   several established analytical frameworks are discussed, and a specific
   categorization of VGI's symbolic geographies as interaction content will
   be introduced. Based on this categorization two opposed types of
   interaction practice can be distinguished: While information on VGI
   gathering and processing as a part of interaction content is vital to a
   competent use and deeper understanding of the system
   ({''}self-explanatory{''}) many interface designs have a very limited
   output in order to promote user-friendliness ({''}easy-to-use{''}).
   While the latter may increase the popularity of VGI it also limits
   interaction language to everyday language, to familiar spatial
   vocabularies of place, city, region, landscape or nation-instead of
   mediating technology's spatialities or exploring more innovative ways of

   This article presents a case study from the Central Tablelands region of

   participatory development of a new online collaboration tool. The case
   study results highlight the significance of issues such as internet

   were not rated as highly as functions relating to data security, sharing

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 12}},
Abstract = {{Knowledge or rule-based approaches are needed for quality assessment and
   assurance in professional or crowdsourced geographic data. Nevertheless,
   many types of geographic knowledge are statistical in nature and are
   therefore difficult to derive rules that are meaningful for this
   purpose. The rules of continuity and symmetry considered in this paper
   can be thought of as two concrete forms of the first law of geography,
   which may be used to formulate quality measures at the individual level
   without referring to ground truth. It is not clear, however, how much
   the rules can be faithful. Hence, the main objective is to test if the
   rules are consistent with street network data over the world.
   Specifically, for the rule of continuity we identify natural streets
   that connect smoothly in a network, and measure the spatial order of
   information (e.g. names, highway level, speed, etc.) along the streets.
   The measure is based on spatial auto-correlation indicators adapted for
   one dimension. For the rule of symmetry, we device an algorithm that
   recognize parallel road pairs (e.g. dual carriageways), and examine to
   what extent attributes in the pairs are identical. The two rules are
   tested against 28 cities selected from OpenStreetMap data worldwide; two
   professional data sets are used to show more insights. We found that the
   rules are consistent with street networks from a wide range of cities of
   different characteristics, and also noted cases with varying degrees of
   agreement. As a side-effect, we discussed possible limitations of the
   autocorrelation indicators used, where cautions are needed when
   interpreting the results. In addition, we present techniques that
   performed the tests automatically, which can be applied to new data to
   further verify (or falsify) our findings, or extended as quality
   assurance tools to detect data items that do not satisfy the rules and
   to suggest possible corrections according to the rules.}},

Abstract = {{Statistics about citizen satisfaction regarding urban facilities and

   propose a cost-effective method for estimating citizen satisfaction

   Two indicators are proposed based on place data derived from the
   Foursquare social media application. Both indicators are based on the
   hypothesis that the higher the number of places is that belong to a
   facility or service type on social media, then the higher the
   satisfaction of citizens regarding this facility or service type will
   be. This hypothesis was tested by using the Eurobarometer survey data as
   reference. The accuracy assessment revealed strong and statistically
   significant linear relationships (R-2 > 0.6) between the reference
   percentage of very satisfied citizens and some categories (i.e. `'Sport
   facilities'', `'Cultural Categories,'' and Streets \& buildings). Other
   categories showed moderate and statistically significant linear
   relationships (i.e. Public spaces'' and Green spaces). Therefore, the
   proposed indicators provide estimates about citizen satisfaction with
   regard to these five categories. The new indicators can be used to
   better design public opinion surveys by making them more relevant to the
   public in terms of topics, space, and time.}},

Abstract = {{OpenStreetMap (OSM) has proven to serve as a promising free global
   encyclopedia of maps with an increasing popularity across different user
   communities and research bodies. One of the unique characteristics of
   OSM has been the availability of the full history of users'
   contributions, which can leverage our quality control mechanisms through
   exploiting the history of contributions. Since this aspect of
   contributions (i.e., historical contributions) has been neglected in the
   literature, this study aims at presenting a novel approach for improving
   the positional accuracy and completeness of the OSM road network. To do
   so, we present a five-stage approach based on a Voronoi diagram that
   leads to improving the positional accuracy and completeness of the OSM
   road network. In the first stage, the OSM data history file is retrieved
   and in the second stage, the corresponding data elements for each object
   in the historical versions are identified. In the third stage, data
   cleaning on the historical datasets is carried out in order to identify
   outliers and remove them accordingly. In the fourth stage, through
   applying the Voronoi diagram method, one representative version for each
   set of historical versions is extracted. In the final stage, through
   examining the spatial relations for each object in the history file, the
   topology of the target object is enhanced. As per validation, a
   comparison between the latest version of the OSM data and the result of
   our approach against a reference dataset is carried out. Given a case
   study in Tehran, our findings reveal that the completeness and
   positional precision of OSM features can be improved up to 14\%. Our
   conclusions draw attention to the exploitation of the historical archive
   of the contributions in OSM as an intrinsic quality indicator.}},

Abstract = {{As an important part of spatial data, the point feature has always been
   an essential element in web maps and navigation maps. With the
   development of location-based services and the rapid increase in
   volunteered geographic information and social media data, the amount of
   point data is increasing day by day, resulting in inevitable problems of
   overlay and congestion during visualization. Map generalization provides
   multiple algorithms that can be used to select, aggregate and make
   typification of points or point clusters. For the generalization of
   point data, however, the traditional stand-alone computing environment
   has difficulty with real-time realization. Currently, the rapid
   development of cloud computing technology provides a powerful support
   for improving the efficiency of map generalization. However, compared
   with the stand-alone environment, the data decomposition and the
   real-time display of point generalization in the cloud platform imposes
   higher requirements on the point generalization constraints, which play
   an important role in point-generalized process control. Based on the
   computational characteristics of the cloud platform, this paper analyzes
   the changes in point generalization constraints. In addition, our work
   proposes the constraints of point generalization based on the cloud
   platform and its construction method, builds a prototype system based on
   the Hadoop cloud platform. Our prototype system is tested using typical
   experimental data. Its efficiency and the quality of its results is
   examined. The results show that the efficiency and quality of point
   selection can be significantly improved by controlling the point
   generalization process with the generalization constraints in the cloud
   computing environment proposed in this paper. This paper provides a
   possible way for the realization of map generalization in the cloud
   computing environment. Its usability with real data and with many users
   accessing it will be the focus of further research.}},

Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The Landsat archives have been made freely available in 2008, allowing
   the production of high resolution built-up maps at the regional or
   global scale. In this context, most of the classification algorithms
   rely on supervised learning to tackle the heterogeneity of the urban
   environments. However, at a large scale, the process of collecting
   training samples becomes a huge project in itself. This leads to a
   growing interest from the remote sensing community toward Volunteered
   Geographic Information (VGI) projects such as OpenStreetMap (OSM).
   Despite the spatial heterogeneity of its contribution patterns, OSM
   provides an increasing amount of information on the earth's surface.
   More interestingly, the community has moved beyond street mapping to
   collect a wider range of spatial data such as building footprints, land
   use, or points of interest. In this paper, we propose a classification
   method that makes use of OSM to automatically collect training samples
   for supervised learning of built-up areas. To take into account a wide
   range of potential issues, the approach is assessed in ten Sub-Saharan
   African urban areas from various demographic profiles and climates. The
   obtained results are compared with: (1) existing high resolution global
   urban maps such as the Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) or the Human
   Built-up and Settlements Extent (HBASE); and (2) a supervised
   classification based on manually digitized training samples. The results
   suggest that automated supervised classifications based on OSM can
   provide performances similar to manual approaches, provided that OSM
   training samples are sufficiently available and correctly pre-processed.
   Moreover, the proposed method could reach better results in the near
   future, given the increasing amount and variety of information in the
   OSM database.}},

   used to model and predict flooding. However, advances in modelling
   techniques have not been matched by improvements in model validation.
   Validation of flood models remains challenging due to a lack of
   available spatially-explicit data; traditionally measured data and
   validation approaches reveal little about the ability of a model to
   simulate the complex dynamics of floodplain flows, including the
   pathways, timeline, and impacts of an event. In this paper we propose a
   novel method for the validation of hydraulic models of flooding using
   quantitative and qualitative Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI).
   This method uses VGI data to enhance traditionally measured validation
   data by reconstructing the observed dynamics of a flood, allowing
   validation of the temporal and spatial simulation of these dynamics. We
   illustrate the method using a case study from Corbridge in the northeast
   of England, using VGI collected through participatory research with
   people affected by severe flooding in 2015. The results of the study
   demonstrate that VGI data can be used for the effective reconstruction
   of flood event dynamics. The results also reveal that the proposed
   validation approach is able to identify underperformance in the model's
   simulation of event dynamics not evaluated by standard global
   performance measures. Such a lack of evaluation can have adverse
   consequences where dynamic model outputs are used locally to influence
   floodplain management. As a result, we propose a new framework for model
   validation, adopting a pragmatic and flexible approach to examining
   event dynamics using a diverse range of data.}},

Abstract = {{Recent years have witnessed an explosion of geospatial data, especially
   in the form of Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI). As a prominent
   example, OpenStreetMap (OSM) creates a free editable map of the world
   from a large number of contributors. On the other hand, social media
   platforms such as Twitter or Instagram supply dynamic social feeds at
   population level. As much of such data is geo-tagged, there is a high
   potential on integrating social media with OSM to enrich OSM with
   semantic annotations, which will complement existing objective
   description oriented annotations to provide a broader range of
   annotations. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive framework on
   integrating social media data and VGI data to derive knowledge about
   geographical objects, specifically, top relevant annotations from tweets
   for objects in OSM. We first integrate geo-tagged tweets with OSM data
   with scalable spatial queries running on MapReduce. We propose a
   frequency based method for annotating boundary based geographic objects
   (a polygon), and a probability based method for annotating point based
   geographic objects (Latitude and Longitude), with consideration of
   noise. We evaluate our methods using a large geo-tagged tweets corpus
   and representative geographic objects from OSM, which demonstrates
   promising results through ground-truth comparison and case studies. We
   are able to produce up to 80\% correct names for geographical objects
   and discover implicitly relevant information, such as popular
   exhibitions of a museum, the nicknames or visitors' impression to a
   tourism attraction.}},

Abstract = {{The emergence of volunteered geographic information (VGI) during the

   assessment of VGI quality and fitness-of-use is still a challenge
   because of the non-standardized and crowdsourced data collection
   process, as well as the unknown skill and motivation of the
   contributors. However, the frequent approach of assessing VGI quality
   against external data sources using ISO quality standard measures is
   problematic because of a frequent lack of available external (reference)
   data, and because for certain types of features, VGI might be more
   up-to-date than the reference data. Therefore, a VGI-intrinsic measure
   of quality is highly desirable. This study proposes such an intrinsic
   measure of quality by developing the concept of aggregated expertise
   based on the characteristics of a feature's contributors. The article
   further operationalizes this concept and examines its feasibility
   through a case study using OpenStreetMap (OSM). The comparison of model
   OSM feature quality with information from a field survey demonstrates
   the successful implementation of this novel approach.}},

Abstract = {{Many authors argue that issues related to interpretability, lack of data
   availability, and limited applicability in terms of policy analysis have
   hindered a more widespread use of accessibility indicators. Aiming to
   address these aspects, this paper presents two accessibility computation
   approaches applied to Nelson Mandela Bay in South Africa. The first
   approach, a household-based accessibility indicator, is designed to
   account for the high diversity both among the South African society and
   in terms of settlement patterns. Besides OpenStreetMap (OSM) as its main
   data source, this indicator uses a census and a travel survey to create
   a synthetic population of the study area. Accessibilities are computed
   based on people's daily activity chains. The second approach, an
   econometric accessibility indicator, relies exclusively on OSM and
   computes the accessibility of a given location as the weighted sum over
   the utilities of all opportunities reachable from that location
   including the costs of overcoming the distance. Neither a synthetic
   population nor travel information is used. It is found that the
   econometric indicator, although associated with much lower input data
   requirements, yields the same quality of insights regarding the
   identification of areas with low levels of accessibility. It also
   possesses advantages in terms of interpretability and policy
   sensitivity. In particular, its exclusive reliance on standardized and
   freely available input data and its easy portability are a novelty that
   can support the more widespread application of accessibility measures.}},

   their mapping skills), and landscape heterogeneity. There was no
   significant difference between male and female workers. Although field
   workers with more years of experience generally had higher mapping
   quality, the relationship was not statistically significant. We found
   differences in the rates of misclassification, omission, and commission
   errors between workers in different landscape types. We conclude that
   the error rates due to misclassification, omission, and commission were
   the lowest in more diverse landscapes (high number of different land use

Abstract = {{The emerging trends and technologies of surveying and mapping

   This paper addresses issues in the advancing toponym practice. First, we

Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{212}},
Pages = {{47-59}},

Abstract = {{Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) offers a potentially
   inexpensive source of reference data for estimating area and assessing
   map accuracy in the context of remote-sensing based land-cover
   monitoring. The quality of observations from VGI and the typical lack of
   an underlying probability sampling design raise concerns regarding use
   of VGI in widely-applied design-based statistical inference. This
   article focuses on the fundamental issue of sampling design used to
   acquire VGI. Design-based inference requires the sample data to be
   obtained via a probability sampling design. Options for incorporating
   VGI within design-based inference include: 1) directing volunteers to
   obtain data for locations selected by a probability sampling design; 2)
   treating VGI data as a ``certainty stratum{''} and augmenting the VGI
   with data obtained from a probability sample; and 3) using VGI to create
   an auxiliary variable that is then used in a model-assisted estimator to
   reduce the standard error of an estimate produced from a probability
   sample. The latter two options can be implemented using VGI data that
   were obtained from a non-probability sampling design, but require
   additional sample data to be acquired via a probability sampling design.
   If the only data available are VGI obtained from a non-probability
   sample, properties of design-based inference that are ensured by
   probability sampling must be replaced by assumptions that may be
   difficult to verify. For example, pseudo-estimation weights can be
   constructed that mimic weights used in stratified sampling estimators.
   However, accuracy and area estimates produced using these pseudo-weights
   still require the VGI data to be representative of the full population,
   a property known as ``external validity{''}. Because design-based
   inference requires a probability sampling design, directing volunteers
   to locations specified by a probability sampling design is the most
   straightforward option for use of VGI in design-based inference.
   Combining VGI from a non-probability sample with data from a probability
   sample using the certainty stratum approach or the model-assisted
   approach are viable alternatives that meet the conditions required for
   design based inference and use the VGI data to advantage to reduce
   standard errors.}},

Abstract = {{Crowdsourced knowledge websites such as Wikipedia and OpenStreetMap are
   increasingly attracting a critical literature which has highlighted the
   fact that the contributor bases of these sites are often
   geodemographically biased: drawn from more affluent and better educated
   segments of the population. However, while bias in contributors is well
   known, we know less about whether this also results in a bias in
   outcomes on these websites: or whether the partial portion of the
   population which does make contributions also works to ``fill in the
   blanks{''}, by adding knowledge about other less well-off neighbouring
   areas which have not attracted a contributor base. This article
   addresses the question of whether such ``neighbourhood effects{''} exist
   in practice. It makes use of a novel dataset of alcohol license data in
   the UK to assess variation in the completeness of the volunteer
   geographic information site OpenStreetMap. The results support existing
   literature in showing that completeness is related to demographics:
   areas with higher levels of wealth and education typically exhibit
   higher levels of completeness. The article then makes a novel
   contribution by showing evidence of the existence of neighbourhood
   effects: poorer regions with more affluent neighbours typically having
   higher levels of completeness than poorer regions which are also
   surrounded by poorer neighbours. The results suggest that crowdsourced
   knowledge websites can aspire to a kind of completeness even whilst user
   bases remain partial and biased.}},

Abstract = {{Crowdsourcing trajectory data is an important approach for accessing and

   for extracting road boundary information from crowdsourcing vehicle
   traces based on Delaunay triangulation (DT). First, an optimization and

   raw global positioning system (GPS) traces and interpolate the
   optimization segments adaptively to ensure there are enough tracking
   points. Second, constructing the DT and the Voronoi diagram within
   interpolated tracking lines to calculate road boundary descriptors using
   the area of Voronoi cell and the length of triangle edge. Then, the road
   boundary detection model is established integrating the boundary
   descriptors and trajectory movement features (e.g., direction) by DT.
   Third, using the boundary detection model to detect road boundary from
   the DT constructed by trajectory lines, and a regional growing method

   Experiments were conducted using the GPS traces of taxis in Beijing,

Abstract = {{Citizen-led movements producing scientific hazard data during disasters
   are increasingly common. After the Japanese earthquake-triggered tsunami
   in 2011, and the resulting radioactive releases at the damaged Fukushima
   Daiichi nuclear power plants, citizens monitored on-ground levels of
   radiation with innovative mobile devices built from off-the-shelf
   components. To date, the citizen-led Safecast project has recorded 50
   million radiation measurements worldwide, with the majority of these
   measurements from Japan. The analysis of data which are
   multi-dimensional, not vetted, and provided from multiple devices
   presents big data challenges due to their volume, velocity, variety, and
   veracity. While the Safecast project produced massive open-source
   radiation measurements at specific coordinates and times, the
   reliability and validity of the overall data have not yet been assessed.
   The nuclear disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear-power plant
   provides a case for assessing the Safecast data with official aerial
   remote sensing radiation data jointly collected by the governments of
   the United States and Japan. This study spatially analyzes and
   statistically compares the citizen-volunteered and government-generated
   radiation data. An assessment of the Safecast dataset requires several
   preprocessing steps. First, it was necessary to convert the data from
   the Safecast ionized radiation sensors since they were collected using
   different units of measure than the government data. Secondly, the
   normally occurring radiation and decay rates of cesium from deposition
   surveys were used to properly compare measurements in space and time.
   Finally, the GPS located points were selected within overlapping extents
   at multiple spatial resolutions. Quantitative measures were used to
   assess the similarity and differences in the observed measurements.
   Radiation measurements from the same geographic extents show similar
   spatial variations and statistically significant correlations. The
   results suggest that? actionable scientific data for disasters and
   emergencies can be inferred from non-traditional and not vetted data
   generated through citizen science projects. This project provides a
   methodology for comparing datasets of radiological measurements over
   time and space. Integrating data for assessment from different Earth
   sensing systems is paramount for societal and environmental problems.}},

Title = {{Using Volunteered Geographic Information to measure name changes of

   Libya case study}},

Abstract = {{Over the past few years, political systems have changed in several
   countries of the Middle East as a result of citizen revolutions on the
   ruling regimes. These geopolitical changes have had effects on the names
   of artificial geographical features, such as roads and schools. Many of
   the names, especially those that were associated with previous regimes,
   were changed to become associated with the revolutions, their dates,
   their leaders, or their martyrs. The recent change in the paradigm of
   Web use towards data sharing and crowd-sourcing in the Web 2.0 provides
   new opportunities to get insight into a local community's perception of
   political events. Crowd-sourced spatial data, often referred to as
   Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI), can be contributed and
   accessed through various websites and data repositories. These data can
   supplement traditional data sources, such as road maps hosted by
   governmental offices. Libya's governmental maps of urban infrastructure
   are scarce and incomplete. This provides an incentive for citizens and
   grassroots groups to collect and generate spatial data on their own and
   to express changed realities of feature names by the means of
   crowd-sourced mapping. Using two districts in Libya this study evaluates
   for five Web 2.0 platforms (OpenStreetMap, Wikimapia, Google Map Maker,
   Panoramio, and Flickr) to which extent VGI reflects name changes of
   geographical features as a result of the revolution in 2011. Other data
   sources, such as school directories posted by teachers on Facebook,
   serve as additional information for feature name change detection.
   Results show that the extent to which VGI reflects name changes based on
   the 2011 revolution in Libya varies strongly between VGI data sources.
   VGI provides a useful supplement to limited governmental resources to
   better understand how names of artificial geographical features are
   affected by changes in political systems.}},

Abstract = {{Pedestrian infrastructure is an essential part of the urban fabric.
   Typically, it is carefully planned and maintained by governments and
   local experts, who recognize the benefits to health, well-being, and
   even economics associated with a walkable environment. Pedestrian
   walkway characteristics, including running slope, cross slope, curb
   cuts, cross walks, sidewalk widths, and signalization are a part of the
   comprehensive design elements used by most municipalities. However,
   barriers or obstacles, including temporary obstructions, construction
   detours, and surface irregularities make this infrastructure difficult
   for individuals with a mobility impairment or vision impairment to use.
   Crowdsourcing can assist these individuals by providing information
   about transient and permanent navigation obstacles, through an
   accessibility mapping system. Accessibility mapping systems, several
   examples of which are discussed in this paper, provide routing functions
   to make navigation easier for individuals with a mobility impairment or
   vision impairment. A geocrowdsourced accessibility system can also
   identify deficiencies in a pedestrian network dynamically, and can
   provision routing and obstacle avoidance functions in real-time, with
   data about transient events provided by the public. This paper is based
   upon previous geocrowdsourced data quality studies, and presents a
   modeling methodology to identify high-value routing corridors in a
   dynamic geocrowdsourced accessibility system. The corridor measurement
   can help civic employees from city public works and transportation
   departments prioritize maintenance of a pedestrian infrastructure,
   including the rectification of obstacles identified through
   crowdsourcing. In this paper, we augment geocrowdsourcing data quality
   metrics with input from subject matter experts trained in orientation
   and mobility services, and discuss the accessibility elements that could
   directly influence the usability of the pedestrian infrastructure. We
   also present a cost optimization model to measure the value of a
   pedestrian network segment. Lastly, this paper analyzes how the value of
   a network segment in a geocrowdsourced accessibility system changes with
   network conditions and how this relates to prioritization of maintenance
   tasks through optimization criteria.}},

Abstract = {{The occurrence of disasters such as extreme flooding in urban
   environments has severe consequences, not only on the human population
   but also on critical infrastructures such as the road networks, which
   are of vital importance for everyday living and particularly for
   emergency response. In this article, our main goal is to
   present-conceptually and in praxis-a model that could be used from the
   emergency responders for timely and efficient emergency management and
   response in an urban complex environment. For the city of Cologne in
   Germany, we aim to indicate possible ways to decrease the emergency
   response time during an extreme flood scenario through the development
   of an accessibility indicator, which consists of different components.
   Therefore, we will investigate the opportunities that occur, in a flood
   risk scenario, from the use of geographic information in different forms
   such as Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) and open-source data in
   an ArcGIS environment, to increase urban resilience through the
   decreasing emergency response time. We will focus on network analysis
   for the fire brigades (first acting emergency responders) during a flood
   scenario to calculate their emergency response ranges and emergency
   response routes through flooded road networks, for the assistance of the
   possibly affected hospitals, refugee homes and fire brigades, which can
   be flooded. At the end of the paper, we suggest that the vulnerable
   community of the refugees could be taken into consideration as a new
   source of VGI, as an additional component that would lead to the
   decrease in the emergency response time. The geo-located information
   that could be provided by the refugee community can be very useful in
   emergency situations, such as those examined in this article where
   timely information can be forwarded to the proper authorities for a more
   focused and timely emergency response, increasing the resilience of the
   urban population and their community.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the availability of Web 2.0 technologies, volunteered geographic
   information (VGI) is on the rise. This new type of data is available on

   remote sensing to detect peri-urbanization in the conservation zone of
   Mexico City. On the one hand, remote sensing identifies horizontal urban
   expansion, and on the other hand, VGI of ecological complaints provides
   data about informal settlements. This enables the combination of
   top-down approaches (remote sensing) and bottom-up approaches
   (ecological complaints). Within the analysis, we identify areas of high
   urbanization as well as complaint densities and bring them together in a
   multi-scale analysis using Geographic Information Systems (GIS).
   Furthermore, we investigate the influence of settlement patterns and
   main roads on the peri-urbanization process in Mexico City using
   OpenStreetMap. Peri-urbanization is detected especially in the
   transition zone between the urban and rural (conservation) area and near
   main roads as well as settlements.}},

Abstract = {{Various approaches have been proposed to address the delineation of

   approaches are based on the increasing availability of road network
   data. However, most approaches have employed one or more parameters to
   divide built-up from non-built-up areas. Very few studies have discussed
   how to determine appropriate thresholds for such parameters. This study
   employed an empirical approach for threshold determination, and
   validated that the approach is applicable for the delineation of

   designed to investigate the most-appropriate thresholds (determined
   using a similarity measure) for multiple parameters of three existing
   approaches (street blocks, grid-based, and kernel density) with regard
   to different administrative regions and cities/towns. The results show
   that in most cases, the most-appropriate thresholds or ranges for
   different subdivisions are either identical or overlap thus validating
   the use of the most-appropriate thresholds to delineate built-up areas
   for one or multiple small subdivisions and, by inference, for a much

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of a study that explored if and how an

   Second, several local community events were organized with Maptime Miami
   to engage local mappers in OSM contribution activities. Third, the

   courses at the University of Florida. The paper analyzes spatio-temporal
   user contributions of these target groups to assess the effectiveness of
   the different outreach techniques for recruitment and retention of OSM
   contributors. Results suggest that the type of prospective users that
   were contacted through our outreach efforts, and their different
   motivations play a major role in their editing activity. Results also
   revealed differences in editing patterns between newly recruited users
   and already established mappers. More specifically, long-term engagement
   of newly registered OSM mappers did not succeed, whereas already
   established contributors continued to import and improve data. In
   general, we found that an OSM data import project can add valuable data

Title = {{Bayesian maximum entropy and data fusion for processing qualitative

Abstract = {{Categorical data play an important role in a wide variety of spatial
   applications, while modeling and predicting this type of statistical
   variable has proved to be complex in many cases. Among other possible
   approaches, the Bayesian maximum entropy methodology has been developed
   and advocated for this goal and has been successfully applied in various
   spatial prediction problems. This approach aims at building a
   multivariate probability table from bivariate probability functions used
   as constraints that need to be fulfilled, in order to compute a
   posterior conditional distribution that accounts for hard or soft
   information sources. In this paper, our goal is to generalize further
   the theoretical results in order to account for a much wider type of
   information source, such as probability inequalities. We first show how
   the maximum entropy principle can be implemented efficiently using a
   linear iterative approximation based on a minimum norm criterion, where
   the minimum norm solution is obtained at each step from simple matrix
   operations that converges to the requested maximum entropy solution.
   Based on this result, we show then how the maximum entropy problem can
   be related to the more general minimum divergence problem, which might
   involve equality and inequality constraints and which can be solved
   based on iterated minimum norm solutions. This allows us to account for
   a much larger panel of information types, where more qualitative
   information, such as probability inequalities can be used. When combined
   with a Bayesian data fusion approach, this approach deals with the case
   of potentially conflicting information that is available. Although the
   theoretical results presented in this paper can be applied to any study
   (spatial or non-spatial) involving categorical data in general, the
   results are illustrated in a spatial context where the goal is to
   predict at best the occurrence of cultivated land in Ethiopia based on
   crowdsourced information. The results emphasize the benefit of the
   methodology, which integrates conflicting information and provides a
   spatially exhaustive map of these occurrence classes over the whole
   country.}},

Abstract = {{Studies on volunteered geographic information (VGI) have focused on
   examining its validity to reveal geographic phenomena in relatively
   recent periods. Empirical evaluation of the validity of VGI to reveal
   geographic phenomena in historical periods (e.g., decades ago) is

   possibility of broadening the temporal scope of VGI applications. This
   article presents an evaluation of the validity of VGI to reveal
   historical geographic phenomena through a citizen data-based habitat
   suitability mapping case study. Citizen data (i.e., sightings) of the
   black-and-white snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus bieti) were elicited
   from local residents through three-dimensional (3D) geovisualization
   interviews in Yunnan, China. The validity of the elicited sightings to
   reveal the historical R. bieti distribution was evaluated through
   habitat suitability mapping using the citizen data in historical
   periods. The results of controlled experiments demonstrated that
   suitability maps predicted using the historical citizen data had a
   consistent spatial pattern (correlation above 0.60) that reflects the R.
   bieti distribution (Boyce index around 0.90) in areas free of
   significant environmental change across historical periods. This in turn
   suggests that citizen data have validity for mapping historical

Abstract = {{In recent years, pluvial floods caused by extreme rainfall events have
   occurred frequently. Especially in urban areas, they lead to serious
   damages and endanger the citizens' safety. Therefore, real-time
   information about such events is desirable. With the increasing
   popularity of social media platforms, such as Twitter or Instagram,
   information provided by voluntary users becomes a valuable source for
   emergency response. Many applications have been built for disaster
   detection and flood mapping using crowdsourcing. Most of the
   applications so far have merely used keyword filtering or classical
   language processing methods to identify disaster relevant documents
   based on user generated texts. As the reliability of social media
   information is often under criticism, the precision of information
   retrieval plays a significant role for further analyses. Thus, in this
   paper, high quality eyewitnesses of rainfall and flooding events are
   retrieved from social media by applying deep learning approaches on user
   generated texts and photos. Subsequently, events are detected through
   spatiotemporal clustering and visualized together with these high
   quality eyewitnesses in a web map application. Analyses and case studies

Abstract = {{Critical knowledge gaps seriously hinder efforts for building disaster
   resilience at all levels, especially in disaster-prone least developed

   general methodological approach that integrates community-based
   participatory mapping processes, one that has been widely used by
   governments and non-government organizations in the fields of natural
   resources management, disaster risk reduction and rural development,
   with emerging collaborative digital mapping techniques. We demonstrate
   the value and potential of this integrated participatory and

   flood-prone lower Karnali river basin in Western Nepal. The process
   engaged a wide range of stakeholders and non-stakeholder citizens to
   co-produce locally relevant geographic information on resources,
   capacities, and flood risks of selected communities. The new digital
   community maps are richer in content, more accurate, and easier to
   update and share than those produced by conventional Vulnerability and
   Capacity Assessments (VCAs), a variant of Participatory Rural Appraisal
   (PRA), that is widely used by various government and non-government

Abstract = {{The recent explosive growth of user-generated geographic information has
   drawn significant attention from GIS scholars and human geographers.
   Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) here refers to a key component
   of such a phenomenon, comprising both a range of practices of geographic
   information production and dissemination by volunteers as well as new
   forms of geospatial data produced and curated through various
   interactive online platforms and mobile devices such as OpenStreetMap
   (OSM) and Google Maps. VGI constructions have raised questions on
   spatial knowledge, power, and context. Through a study that examines
   social constructions of OSM in China, this paper makes two contributions
   to the existing literature: providing a political economic account of
   VGI constructions in China and exploring legalities in VGI research.
   Informed by research in critical GIS, this paper traces political
   economic transitions in relation to OSM constructions and examines OSM
   contributors' experiences and how these experiences constitute OSM
   development and usage. Drawing upon law and society research, this paper
   investigates how OSM mappers encounter the states regulatory scheme of
   online mapping. This legality perspective of spatial data production and
   usage is a topic rarely explored in VGI studies. With interview data and
   document analysis, this paper unravels processes of powerful state
   institutional arrangements to control and invest in VGI simultaneously,
   entrepreneurs' interest in developing location-based services using VGI
   data, and experiences from a tech-savvy group in exploring and making
   VGI. While individual experiences vary, they show efforts of questioning
   embedded power relations shaping spatial data production in these
   continuously evolving, contested technoscientific and social landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in network science and the development of volunteered

   coefficient, to measure the degree correlations of road networks
   represented as dual graphs of strokes, axial lines, and named roads.
   After investigating 100 road networks worldwide obtained from

   disassortative or uncorrelated in stroke and named road representations,
   but assortative when represented as axial lines. Inconsistency in
   different measures persists regardless of method of representation;
   therefore, qualitative dichotomy or trichotomy is insufficient to
   describe the actual connection pattern in road networks. A taxonomy of

Abstract = {{Floods are one of the most devastating types of worldwide disasters in
   terms of human, economic, and social losses. If authoritative data is
   scarce, or unavailable for some periods, other sources of information
   are required to improve streamflow estimation and early flood warnings.
   Georeferenced social media messages are increasingly being regarded as
   an alternative source of information for coping with flood risks.
   However, existing studies have mostly concentrated on the links between
   geo-social media activity and flooded areas. Thus, there is still a gap
   in research with regard to the use of social media as a proxy for
   rainfall-runoff estimations and flood forecasting. To address this, we
   propose using a transformation function that creates a proxy variable
   for rainfall by analysing geo-social media messages and rainfall
   measurements from authoritative sources, which are later incorporated
   within a hydrological model for streamflow estimation. We found that the
   combined use of official rainfall values with the social media proxy
   variable as input for the Probability Distributed Model (PDM), improved
   streamflow simulations for flood monitoring. The combination of
   authoritative sources and transformed geo-social media data during flood
   events achieved a 71\% degree of accuracy and a 29\% underestimation
   rate in a comparison made with real streamflow measurements. This is a
   significant improvement on the respective values of 39\% and 58\%,
   achieved when only authoritative data were used for the modelling. This
   result is clear evidence of the potential use of derived geo-social
   media data as a proxy for environmental variables for improving flood
   early warning systems.}},

Abstract = {{Change detection in satellite images is a key concern of the Earth
   Observation field for environmental and climate change monitoring.
   Satellite images also provide important clues to both the past and
   present surface conditions of other planets, which cannot be validated
   on the ground. With the volume of satellite imagery continuing to grow,
   the inadequacy of computerised solutions to manage and process imagery
   to the required professional standard is of critical concern. Whilst
   studies find the crowd sourcing approach suitable for the counting of
   impact craters in single images, images of higher resolution contain a
   much wider range of features, and the performance of novices in
   identifying more complex features and detecting change, remains unknown.
   This paper presents a first step towards understanding whether novices
   can identify and annotate changes in different geomorphological
   features. A website was developed to enable visitors to flick between
   two images of the same location on Mars taken at different times and
   classify 1) if a surface feature changed and if so, 2) what feature had
   changed from a pre-defined list of six. Planetary scientists provided
   ``expert{''} data against which classifications made by novices could be
   compared when the project subsequently went public.
   Whilst no significant difference was found in images identified with
   surface changes by expert and novices, results exhibited differences in
   consensus within and between experts and novices when asked to classify
   the type of change. Experts demonstrated higher levels of agreement in
   classification of changes as dust devil tracks, slope streaks and impact
   craters than other features, whilst the consensus of novices was
   consistent across feature types; furthermore, the level of consensus
   amongst regardless of feature type. These trends are secondary to the
   low levels of consensus found, regardless of feature type or classifier
   expertise. These findings demand the attention of researchers who want
   to use crowd-sourcing for similar scientific purposes, particularly for
   the supervised training of computer algorithms, and inform the scope and
   design of future projects.}},

Abstract = {{Landslides triggered by large earthquakes in mountainous regions
   contribute significantly to overall earthquake losses and pose a major
   secondary hazard that can persist for months or years. While scientific
   investigations of coseismic landsliding are increasingly common, there
   is no protocol for rapid (hours-to-days) humanitarian-facing landslide
   assessment and no published recognition of what is possible and what is
   useful to compile immediately after the event. Drawing on the 2015 M-w
   7.8 Gorkha earthquake in Nepal, we consider how quickly a landslide
   assessment based upon manual satellite-based emergency mapping (SEM) can
   be realistically achieved and review the decisions taken by analysts to
   ascertain the timeliness and type of useful information that can be
   generated. We find that, at present, many forms of landslide assessment
   are too slow to generate relative to the speed of a humanitarian
   response, despite increasingly rapid access to high-quality imagery.
   Importantly, the value of information on landslides evolves rapidly as a
   disaster response develops, so identifying the purpose, timescales, and
   end users of a post-earthquake landslide assessment is essential to
   inform the approach taken. It is clear that discussions are needed on
   the form and timing of landslide assessments, and how best to present
   and share this information, before rather than after an earthquake
   strikes. In this paper, we share the lessons learned from the Gorkha
   earthquake, with the aim of informing the approach taken by scientists
   to understand the evolving landslide hazard in future events and the

Abstract = {{Rapid flood mapping is critical for timely damage assessment and
   post-event recovery support. Remote sensing provides spatially explicit
   information for the mapping process, but its real-time imagery is often
   not available due to bad weather conditions during the event. Using the
   2015 South Carolina Flood in downtown Columbia as a case study, this
   article proposes a novel approach to retrieve near real-time flood
   probability map by integrating the post-event remote sensing data with
   the real-time volunteered geographic information (VGI). Relying on each
   VGI point, an inverse distance weighted height filter was introduced to
   build a probability index distribution (PID) layer from the
   high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) data. For each PID layer,
   a Gaussian kernel was developed to extract its moisture weight from the
   normalized difference water index (NDWI) of an EO-1 Advanced Land Imager
   (ALI) image. Finally, a normalized flood probability map was produced by
   chaining the moisture weighted PIDs in a Python environment. Results
   indicate that, by adding the wetness information from post-event
   satellite observations, the proposed model could provide near real-time
   flood probability distribution with real-time social media, which is of
   great importance for emergency responders to quickly identify areas in
   need of immediate attention.}},

   the library is a natural home for humanitarian mapathons, as
   participants actively engage with spatial and data literacy concepts as
   they become spatial data creators. Through library mapathons,

Abstract = {{Integral to some conceptualizations of the ``smart city{''} is the
   adoption of web-based technology to support civic engagement and improve
   information systems for local government decision support. Yet there is
   little to no literature on the ``smartness{''} of gathering information
   about historic places within municipal information systems. This chapter
   provides three case studies of technologically augmented planning
   processes that incorporated citizens as sensors of data about historic
   places. The first case study is of SurveyLA, a massive effort of the
   city of Los Angeles to comprehensively survey over 880,000 parcels for
   historic resources. A second case study involves Motor City Mapping, an
   effort to identify the condition of buildings in Detroit, Michigan and a
   parallel historical survey conducted by volunteers. In Austin, Texas, a
   university-based research team designed a municipal web tool called the
   Austin Historical Survey Wiki. This chapter offers insights into these
   prior efforts to augment planning processes with ``digitized memory,{''}
   web-based technology, and public engagement.}},

   academic and public understanding of geographical and ecological
   processes. Videos hosted online represent-a large data source that could
   potentially provide meaningful results for studies in physical
   geographya concept we term volunteered geographic videos (VGV).
   Technological advances in image-capturing devices, computing, and image
   processing have resulted in increasingly sophisticated methods that
   treat imagery as raw data, such as resolving high-resolution topography
   with structure from motion or the calculation of surface flow velocity
   in rivers with particle image velocimetry. The ubiquitous nature of
   recording devices and citizens who share imagery online have resulted in
   a vast archive of potentially useful online videos. This article
   analyzes the potential for using YouTube videos for research in physical
   geography. We discuss the combination of suitability and availability
   that has made this possible and emphasize the distinction between
   moderately suitable imagery that can directly answer research questions
   and lower suitability imagery that can indirectly support a study. We
   present example case studies that address (1) initial considerations of
   using VGV, (2) topographic data extraction from a video taken after a
   landslide, and (3) data extraction from a video of a flash flood that
   could support a study of extreme floods and wood transport. Finally, we
   discuss both the benefits and complicating factors associated with VGV.
   The results indicate that VGV could be used to support certain studies
   in physical geography and that this large repository of raw data has
   been underutilized.}},

Pages = {{1150-1167}},
Abstract = {{This article presents a new methodology for data fitness-for-use
   assessment. Most current measures of data quality rely on metadata and
   other data producer-derived information. This creates a void of options
   for a user-driven assessment of data quality when metadata are sparse or
   unavailable, as is often the case with citizen science and volunteered
   geographic information. This article puts forward data fitness-for-use
   (DaFFU), a method that can be adapted for a wide range of data uses.
   Using the mathematical framework of multiple criteria decision making
   (MCDM), we create a method to select the best data set from multiple
   options using a select set of user criteria. The DaFFU methodology is
   demonstrated with both a simple exemplar and a detailed case study for
   watershed management. The simple exemplar illustrates how varying
   parameters and weights influence the outcome. The case study on
   watershed management considers four possible data sets and six data
   quality criteria for wetland delineation and an application toward
   watershed nitrogen retention, each of which has a claim on being of the
   best quality, depending on which data quality aspect the user evaluates.
   The DaFFU methodology allows the user to consider these data in terms of
   how they will be used and to use selected data quality measures. Case
   study results show this methodology is a robust and flexible approach to
   quantitatively assessing multiple data sets in terms of their intended
   use.}},

Abstract = {{Global data on settlements, built-up land and population distributions
   are becoming increasingly available and represent important inputs to a
   better understanding of key demographic processes such as urbanization
   and interactions between human and natural systems over time. One
   persistent drawback that prevents user communities from effectively and
   objectively using these data products more broadly, is the absence of
   thorough and transparent validation studies. This study develops a
   validation framework for accuracy assessment of multi temporal built-up
   land layers using integrated public parcel and building records as
   validation data. The framework is based on measures derived from
   confusion matrices and incorporates a sensitivity analysis for potential
   spatial offsets between validation and test data as well as tests for
   the effects of varying criteria of the abstract term built-up land on
   accuracy measures. Furthermore, the framework allows for accuracy
   assessments by strata of built-up density, which provides important
   insights on the relationship between classification accuracy and
   development intensity to better instruct and educate user communities on
   quality aspects that might be relevant to different purposes. We use
   data from the newly-released Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL), for
   four epochs since 1975 and at fine spatial resolution (38 m), in the
   United States for a demonstration of the framework. The results show
   very encouraging accuracy measures that vary across study areas,
   generally improve over time but show very distinct patterns across the
   rural-urban trajectories. Areas of higher development intensity are very
   accurately classified and highly reliable. Rural areas show low degrees
   of accuracy, which could be affected by misalignment between the
   reference data and the data under test in areas where built-up land is
   scattered and rare. However, a regression analysis, which examines how
   well GHSL can estimate built-up land using spatially aggregated
   analytical units, indicates that classification error is mainly of
   thematic nature. Thus, caution should be taken in using the data product
   in rural regions. The results can be useful in further improving
   classification procedures to create measures of the built environment.
   The validation framework can be extended to data-poor regions of the
   world using map data and Volunteered Geographic Information.}},

Abstract = {{Since OpenStreetMap (OSM) appeared more than ten years ago, new
   collaborative mapping approaches have emerged in different areas and

   importance of the space-time attributes of almost every event and
   phenomenon. Citizens now have endless possibilities to quickly
   geographically locate themselves with an accuracy previously thought
   impossible. Based on these societal drivers, we proposed a number of
   collaborative mapping experiments ({''}mapping parties{''}) to delegates
   of a large open-source geospatial conference and to citizens of the
   conference's host city during July 2015. These mapping parties had a
   wide conceptual range from VGI (Volunteered Geographic Information) to
   geo-crowdsourcing (involuntary crowd-contributed geographic content).
   Specifically, the mapping parties were: (1) ``traditional{''} OSM
   mapping, (2) indoor mapping and localisation, (3) emotional mapping of
   cities, (4) game-based validation of land cover data sets and (5)
   sensing the city and conference implicitly from Twitter. In this

   of the mapping experiments in order to demonstrate the commonalities and
   also the differences between experiments. We consider future research

Abstract = {{This chapter discusses a multidisciplinary research project called Urban
   Nexus, which aims at studying the role of big data in urban governance,
   along with the need of a high-level query language to allow analysts,
   geographers and, in general, non-programmers to easily cross-analyze
   multisource big data produced by the inhabitants and coming also from
   other sources of information. The project focuses on the production of
   Volunteered Geographic Information by means of apps, crowdsourced data
   from social networks and fosters an analysis based also on authoritative
   geo-referenced data coming from multiple institutional sources. The
   Urban Nexus project applies novel and multidisciplinary approaches to
   interpret social aspects of big data, in relation to three medium-sized
   cities and their surrounding areas: Bergamo in the wider context of
   Milan (Italy), Lausanne and the other cities of Switzerland and
   Cambridge and the metropolitan area of London (UK). Focused on urban
   regeneration and mobility, we want to devise and test methods to make
   such cities learning cities, i.e., territories where the inhabitants
   help to identify the design guidelines according to their competence on
   places that is their spatial capital {[}1]. In particular, we identified
   an analysis method of data sets represented by means of the JSON
   lightweight data-interchange format. Currently, JSON has become the de
   facto standard for exchanging Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI)
   and crowdsourced data created within social networks. Since an easy to
   use high-level language for querying and manipulating collections of
   possibly geo-tagged JSON objects is still unavailable, as well as an
   integrated framework for data management and visualization of geo-tagged
   JSON data sets, we devised a new framework named J-CO. In this
   framework, we propose a high-level language, called J-CO-QL (firstly
   introduced in {[}2]), which is based on a well-defined execution model.
   A plug-in for QGIS is provided as well: it permits to visualize
   geo-tagged data sets stored in a NoSQL database such as MongoDB;
   furthermore, the same plug-in can be used to write and execute J-CO-QL
   queries on those databases. By means of a practical example, we show how
   the J-CO framework is able to allow geographers and analysts to work on
   complex data sets coming from VGI sources, in order to study the
   mobility of city users who voluntarily participated to the gathering
   process of data for the city of Bergamo.}},

Abstract = {{Volunteered geographic information (VGI) has entered a phase where there
   are both a substantial amount of crowdsourced information available and
   a big interest in using it by organizations. But the issue of deciding
   the quality of VGI without resorting to a comparison with authoritative
   data remains an open challenge. This article first formulates the
   problem of quality assessment of VGI data. Then presents a model to
   measure trustworthiness of information and reputation of contributors by
   analyzing geometric, qualitative, and semantic aspects of edits over
   time. An implementation of the model is running on a small data-set for
   a preliminary empirical validation. The results indicate that the
   computed trustworthiness provides a valid approximation of VGI quality.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, several research projects show interest in employing
   volunteered geographic information (VGI) to improve their systems
   through using up-to-date and detailed data. The European project
   CAP4Access is one of the successful examples of such international-wide
   research projects that aims to improve the accessibility of people with
   restricted mobility using crowdsourced data. In this project,
   OpenStreetMap (OSM) is used to extend OpenRouteService, a well-known
   routing platform. However, a basic challenge that this project tackled
   was the incompleteness of OSM data with regards to certain information
   that is required for wheelchair accessibility (e.g. sidewalk
   information, kerb data, etc.). In this article, we present the results
   of initial assessment of sidewalk data in OSM at the beginning of the
   project as well as our approach in awareness raising and using tools for
   tagging accessibility data into OSM database for enriching the sidewalk
   data completeness. Several experiments have been carried out in
   different European cities, and discussion on the results of the
   experiments as well as the lessons learned are provided. The lessons
   learned provide recommendations that help in organizing better mapping
   party events in the future. We conclude by reporting on how and to what
   extent the OSM sidewalk data completeness in these study areas have
   benefited from the mapping parties by the end of the project.}},

Pages = {{2209-2224}},
Abstract = {{Local knowledge has been underrepresented in food-related policies and
   planning. The goal of this research was to engage members of a local
   food community and generate volunteered geographic information (VGI) on
   community food assets. During active data collection, over 200 food
   assets were reported. This paper details the systematic approach used to
   create VGI, which emphasizes the socio-cultural context surrounding the
   mapping technology. The project began with an identified need to connect
   to and learn from the local food community. The participants were drawn
   from active food system stakeholders, and a Geoweb infrastructure was
   selected based on publicly available crowdsourcing tools. The resulting
   VGI is presented according to system functions: input (Web traffic,
   contributors, input types), management (contribution vetting, privacy),
   analysis (typology of input), and presentation (sharing the submitted
   data). Despite limitations, this study revealed a hyper-local and
   community-driven perspective on food assets, opened access to government
   and private data, and increased the transparency and accessibility of
   information on the regional food system. This research also revealed
   that there is a growing need for intermediaries who can bridge the gap
   between experts in the subject matter and experts in digitally enabled
   participation, and a need for non-government open data repositories.}},

Pages = {{2225-2246}},
Abstract = {{Geo-tagged travel photos on social networks often contain location data
   such as points of interest (POIs), and also users' travel preferences.
   In this paper, we propose a hybrid ensemble learning method, BAyes-Knn,
   that predicts personalized tourist routes for travelers by mining their
   geographical preferences from these location-tagged data. Our method
   trains two types of base classifiers to jointly predict the next travel
   destination: (1) The K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier quantifies
   users' location history, weather condition, temperature and
   seasonalityand uses a feature-weighted distance model to predict a
   user's personalized interests in an unvisited location. (2) A Bayes
   classifier introduces a smooth kernel function to estimate a-priori
   probabilities of features and then combines these probabilities to
   predict a user's latent interests in a location. All the outcomes from
   these subclassifiers are merged into one final prediction result by
   using the Borda count voting method. We evaluated our method on
   geo-tagged Flickr photos and Beijing weather data collected from 1
   January 2005 to 1 July 2016. The results demonstrated that our ensemble
   approach outperformed 12 other baseline models. In addition, the results
   showed that our framework has better prediction accuracy than do
   context-aware significant travel-sequence-patterns recommendations and
   frequent travel-sequence patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Volunteered Geographic Information, social media, and data from
   Information and Communication Technology are emerging sources of big

   anonymity of these crowd-sourced or crowd-harvested data sources lack
   the socioeconomic and demographic attributes to examine and explain
   human mobility and spatiotemporal patterns. In this paper, we
   investigate an Internet-based demographic data source, personal
   microdata databases publicly accessible on the World Wide Web (hereafter
   web demographics), as potential sources of aspatial and spatiotemporal
   information regarding the landscape of human dynamics. The objectives of
   this paper are twofold: (1) to develop an analytical framework to
   identify mobile population from web demographics as an individual-level
   residential history data, and (2) to explore their geographic and
   demographic patterns of migration. Using web demographics of
   Vietnamese-Americans in Texas collected in 2010 as a case study, this
   paper (1) addresses entity resolution and identifies mobile population
   through the application of a Cost-Sensitive Alternative Decision Tree
   (CS-ADT) algorithm, (2) investigates migration pathways and clusters to
   include both short- and long-distance patterns, and (3) analyze the

Abstract = {{Modeling the geographic distribution of tourists at a tourist
   destination is crucial when it comes to enhancing the destination's
   resilience to disasters and crises, as it enables the efficient
   allocation of limited resources to precise geographic locations. Seldom
   have existing studies explored the geographic distribution of tourists
   through understanding the mechanisms behind it. This article proposes to
   couple maximum entropy modeling with geotagged social media data to
   determine the geographic distribution of tourists in order to facilitate
   disaster and crisis management at tourist destinations. As one of the
   most popular tourist destinations in the United States, San Diego was
   chosen as the study area to demonstrate the proposed approach. We
   modeled the tourist geographic distribution in the study area by
   quantifying the relationship between the distribution and five
   environmental factors, including land use, land parcel, elevation,
   distance to the nearest major road and distance to the nearest transit
   stop. The geographic distribution's dependency on and sensitivity to the
   environmental factors were uncovered. The model was subsequently applied
   to estimate the potential impacts of one simulated tsunami disaster and
   one simulated traffic breakdown due to crisis events such as a political
   protest or a fire hazard. As such, the effectiveness of the approach has
   been demonstrated with specific disaster and crisis scenarios.}},

Journal = {{URBAN PLANNING}},

Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-20}},
Abstract = {{Most cities are car-centric, allocating a privileged amount of urban
   space to cars at the expense of sustainable mobility like cycling.
   Simultaneously, privately owned vehicles are vastly underused, wasting
   valuable opportunities for accommodating more people in a livable urban
   environment by occupying spacious parking areas. Since a data-driven
   quantification and visualization of such urban mobility space inequality
   is lacking, here we explore how crowdsourced data can help to advance
   its understanding. In particular, we describe how the open-source online
   platform What the Street!? uses massive user-generated data from
   OpenStreetMap for the interactive exploration of city-wide mobility
   spaces. Using polygon packing and graph algorithms, the platform
   rearranges all parking and mobility spaces of cars, rails, and bicycles
   of a city to be directly comparable, making mobility space inequality
   accessible to a broad public. This crowdsourced method confirms a
   prevalent imbalance between modal share and space allocation in 23
   cities worldwide, typically discriminating bicycles. Analyzing the
   guesses of the platform's visitors about mobility space distributions,
   we find that this discrimination is consistently underestimated in the
   public opinion. Finally, we discuss a visualized scenario in which
   extensive parking areas are regained through fleets of shared,
   autonomous vehicles. We outline how such accessible visualization
   platforms can facilitate urban planners and policy makers to reclaim
   road and parking space for pushing forward sustainable transport
   solutions.}},

Abstract = {{How do people perceive landscapes? What elements of the landscape do
   they identify as characteristic of a landscape? And how can we arrive at
   descriptions, and ultimately representations that better reflect
   people's notions of landscapes? In this study, we collected landscape
   descriptions from five landscape types at 10 study sites in Switzerland.
   For each site, we collected data from three sources: free lists with
   participants, hiking blogs, and Flickr tags. Free lists were obtained
   through on-site interviews with visitors, hiking blogs were gathered by
   focused crawling of web content, and Flickr tags were selected based on
   spatial footprints obtained from the hiking blogs. We quantitatively
   compared landscape descriptions between data sources and landscape types
   using cosine similarity. We found that descriptions from the same data
   source were significantly more similar, irrespective of landscape type.
   Descriptions from the same landscape type were more similar, but only
   within the same data source. Through a qualitative analysis of different
   aspects of landscape in our content, we found that each data source
   offered a different distribution of landscape aspects. For example,
   while Flickr tags contained high proportions of toponyms, they contained
   little content relating to sense of place. In contrast, hiking blogs
   contained more information about sense of place. Our approach combining
   these varied textual sources thus offers a more holistic view on
   landscapes. This study constitutes a step toward extracting semantically
   rich descriptions of landscapes from a variety of sources and using this
   information to distinguish different landscapes, with potential
   applications for landscape monitoring and management.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last two decades, online communities have become ubiquitous,
   with millions of people accessing collaborative project websites every
   day. Among them, the OpenStreetMap project (OSM) has been very
   successful in collecting/offering volunteered geographic information
   (VGI). Very different behaviours are observed among OSM participants,
   which translate into large differences of lifespan, contribution levels
   (e.g. Nielsen's 90-9-1 rule) and attitudes towards innovations (e.g.
   Diffusion of innovation theory or DoIT). So far, the literature has
   defined phases in the life cycle of contributors only based on the
   nature of their contributions (e.g. role of participants and edits
   characteristics). Our study identifies the different phases of their
   life cycle from a temporal perspective and assesses how these phases
   relate to the volume and the frequency of the contributions from
   participants. Survival analyses were performed using both a
   complementary cumulative distribution function and a Kaplan-Meier
   estimator to plot survival and hazard curves. The analyses were broken
   down according to Nielsen and DoIT contributors' categories to highlight
   potential explanatory variables. This paper shows that two contribution
   processes combine with three major participation stages to form six
   phases in contributors' life cycle. The volume of edits provided on each
   active day is driven by the two contribution processes, illustrating the
   evolution of contributors' motivation over time. Since contributors'
   lifespan is a universal metric, our results may also apply to other
   collaborative online communities.}},

   platform that aims to harvest Volunteered Geographical Information (VGI)
   from social networks and collaborative projects was created. This
   enables the integration of VGI with data coming from other sources, such
   as data collected by physical sensors in real time and made available

   example, official maps. The architecture of the created platform is
   described and its first prototype presented. Some example queries are

Abstract = {{This article presents an innovative approach to establish the quality
   and credibility of Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) such that it
   can be considered in Land Administration Systems (LAS) on a Fit for
   Purpose (FFP) basis. A participatory land information system can provide
   affordable and timely FFP information about land and its resources.
   However, the establishment of such a system involves more than just
   technical solutions and administrative procedures: many social, economic
   and political aspects must be considered. Innovative approaches like VGI
   can help address the lack of accurate, reliable and FFP land information
   for LAS, but integration of such sources relies on the quality and
   credibility of VGI. Verifying volunteer efforts can be difficult without
   reference to ground truth: a novel Trust and Reputation Modelling
   methodology is proposed as a suitable technique to effect such VGI data
   set validation. This method has been applied to successfully demonstrate
   that VGI can produce accurate and reliable data sets which can be used
   to conduct regular systematic updates of geographic information in
   official systems. It relies on a view that the public can police
   themselves in establishing proxy measures of VGI quality thus
   facilitating VGI to be used on a FFP basis in LAS.}},

Abstract = {{Volunteered geographic information (VGI) can be considered a subset of
   crowdsourced data (CSD) and its popularity has recently increased in a
   number of application areas. Disaster management is one of its key
   application areas in which the benefits of VGI and CSD are potentially
   very high. However, quality issues such as credibility, reliability and
   relevance are limiting many of the advantages of utilising CSD.
   Credibility issues arise as CSD come from a variety of heterogeneous
   sources including both professionals and untrained citizens. VGI and CSD
   are also highly unstructured and the quality and metadata are often
   undocumented. In the 2011 Australian floods, the general public and
   disaster management administrators used the Ushahidi Crowd-mapping
   platform to extensively communicate flood-related information including
   hazards, evacuations, emergency services, road closures and property
   damage. This study assessed the credibility of the Australian
   Broadcasting Corporation's Ushahidi CrowdMap dataset using a Naive
   Bayesian network approach based on models commonly used in spam email
   detection systems. The results of the study reveal that the spam email
   detection approach is potentially useful for CSD credibility detection
   with an accuracy of over 90\% using a forced classification methodology.}},

   information or aggregate analysis but for contextual, everyday use.
   Consumer users and their knowledges are coconstituted through mobile map
   viewing and as materially limited technological practices. This article
   focuses specifically on the consumer users' concept of scale in this
   context, for Web-based maps' multiscalar views differentiate them from
   older maps. The second half analyzes mobile map consumer users' concepts
   of scale in a series of focus groups that involved both questions and
   observing participants' actions with maps on their own phones. Instead
   of passively accepting maps at predetermined optimized scales from the

Abstract = {{In the wake of disasters, communities organize to produce spatial data
   capturing knowledge about the disaster and to fill gaps left by formal
   emergency responders. The ways in which communities affect overall
   response efforts can produce inequalities, disempowerment, or further
   marginalization. Increasingly, this organizing and knowledge production
   occurs through digital technologies and, recently, digital
   humanitarianism has become an important suite of such technologies.
   Digital humanitarianism includes technologies like the crowd-sourced
   crisis mapping platform Ushahidi and the community of volunteers
   Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team, which focuses on the amateur-generated
   global base map OpenStreetMap. Digital humanitarianism is shifting how
   needs and knowledges are captured and represented as data following
   disasters. These transformations raise important questions for
   geographers interested in the sociopolitical and institutional processes
   that frame data production and representation. In this article, I
   contribute to geographers' efforts to understand the institutional and
   community-based politics that frame the types of data that are produced
   in disaster contexts by drawing on an ethnographic project that took
   place in both Washington, DC, and New York City after Superstorm Sandy
   in 2012. I show that digital humanitarians produced data in the Rockaway
   Peninsula of New York in response to perceived gaps on the part of
   formal emergency responders. In so doing, they represented needs,
   individuals, and communities in ways that local community advocacy
   organizations found problematic. These findings shed light on the
   politics and struggles around why particular data sets were produced and
   the motives behind capturing particular disaster-related needs and
   knowledge as data.}},

Abstract = {{Volunteered geographic information (VGI) refers to changing practices in
   recent years associated with technological advancements that provide
   increasing opportunities for private citizens to produce geographic
   information. VGI activities range from public contributions to online
   crowdsourced mapping projects to location-related posts on social media
   sites. These changing practices have important implications for
   citizens, traditional authoritative systems of geographic knowledge
   production, and the disciplines of geography and GIScience. One field
   affected by VGI is disaster management, with numerous studies reporting
   on the opportunities associated with increased citizen data and
   involvement in crisis response. There are also significant limitations
   to the application of VGI, however, notably related to scale, the
   digital divide, trust, uneven power relations, and adaptability of
   existing authoritative systems, such as formal emergency management. In
   this article, these issues and more are critically discussed through
   examination of three discreet yet related studies of VGI in community
   bushfire (wildfire) risk reduction in Australia. Although each study has
   its own unique contributions already published, the collective insight
   gained by analyzing the studies together provides new and deeper
   perspectives on critical issues of relevance to both disaster management
   policies and geography and GIScience. Importantly, the article advocates
   for greater emphasis on the social aspect of VGI, with citizens mapping
   and sharing knowledge together, rather than on individual observations
   and large volumes of data. Further, it raises questions of some of the
   much-promoted promises of VGI, particularly those that suggest that VGI
   can allow ``everyone{''} to contribute to geographic knowledge

Abstract = {{While the effects of non-geographic aggregation on statistical inference
   are well studied in economics, research on the effects of geographic
   aggregation on regression analysis is rather scarce. This knowledge gap,
   together with the use of aggregated spatial units in previous firm
   location studies, results in a lack of understanding of firm location
   determinants at the microgeographic level. Suitable data for
   microgeographic location analysis has become available only recently
   through the emergence of Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI),
   especially the OpenStreetMap (OSM) project, and the increasing
   availability of official (open) geodata. In this paper, we use a
   comprehensive dataset of three million street-level geocoded firm
   observations to explore the location pattern of software firms in an
   Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA). Based on the ESDA results, we
   develop a software firm location prediction model using Poisson
   regression and OSM data. Our findings offer novel insights into the mode
   of operation of the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP) in the context
   of a microgeographic location analysis: We find that non-aggregated data
   can be used to detect information on location determinants, which are
   superimposed when aggregated spatial units are analyzed, and that some
   findings of previous firm location studies are not robust at the
   microgeographic level. However, we also conclude that the lack of
   high-resolution geodata on socio-economic population characteristics
   causes systematic prediction errors, especially in cities with diverse
   and segregated populations.}},

Abstract = {{The trend of using volunteered and collaborative data in the context of
   natural disasters has been increasing. This fact, together with floods
   and inundations, which occur in the city of Sao Paulo, makes it possible
   to explore the volunteered and collaborative way of generating and
   transmitting geographic data dynamically. This can be done by using
   technologies affordable to the population, such as the Internet, the
   global positioning system and other monitoring systems embedded in
   mobiles. This article aims to present the proposal of a conceptual
   scheme for a dynamic and collaborative mapping system of flooding
   points, whose data source comes from people equipped with mobile devices
   that allow identify their locations. The results correspond to the
   conceptual scheme of the system as well as the prototype Flooding
   Points' - a map available on the web showing the flooding points in the
   city, which were provided at the time of the event by ordinary people.
   The prototype was developed by using the free and open source
   Crowdmap/Ushahidi platform. The system was assessed by a questionnaire
   answered by the users, who gave their opinion about its feasibility, as
   well as the adjustments which must be made for the population's
   effective use. It was found that the application of system for subjects
   of inundation and flooding is complex in relation for other types of
   events due to its temporal dynamics characteristics. The results of the
   questionnaire, applied to evaluate the system, demonstrated the public
   utility of the application and the interest of the population for a
   dynamic system that enables the exchange of information on the problem
   of inundation and flooding in near real time in the city of Sao Paulo.}},

Abstract = {{In the first hours of a disaster, up-to-date information about the area
   of interest is crucial for effective disaster management. However, due
   to the delay induced by collecting and analysing satellite imagery,
   disaster management systems like the Copernicus Emergency Management
   Service (EMS) are currently not able to provide information products
   until up to 48-72 h after a disaster event has occurred. While satellite
   imagery is still a valuable source for disaster management, information
   products can be improved through complementing them with user-generated
   data like social media posts or crowdsourced data. The advantage of
   these new kinds of data is that they are continuously produced in a
   timely fashion because users actively participate throughout an event
   and share related information. The research project Evolution of
   Emergency Copernicus services (E2mC) aims to integrate these novel data
   into a new EMS service component called Witness, which is presented in
   this paper. Like this, the timeliness and accuracy of geospatial
   information products provided to civil protection authorities can be
   improved through leveraging user-generated data. This paper sketches the
   developed system architecture, describes applicable scenarios and
   presents several preliminary case studies, providing evidence that the
   scientific and operational goals have been achieved.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The OpenStreetMap (OSM) geographic data model has three principal object
   types: nodes (points), ways (polygons and polylines), and relations
   (logical grouping of all three object types to express real-world
   geographical relationships). While there has been very significant
   analysis of OSM over the past decade or so, very little research
   attention has been given to OSM relations. In this paper, we provide an
   exploratory overview of relations in OSM for four European cities. In
   this exploration, we undertake analysis of relations to assess their
   complexity, composition and flexibility within the OSM data model. We
   show that some of the patterns discovered by researchers related to OSM
   nodes and ways also exist in relations. We find some other interesting
   aspects of relations which we believe can act as a catalyst for a more
   sustained future research effort on relations in OSM. These aspects
   include: the potential influence of bulk imports of geographical data to
   OSM, tagging of relations, and contribution patterns of edits to OSM
   relations.}},

   investigate and identify specific spatial patterns of cycle routes. The
   proposed analysis was applied to the cities of Amsterdam (The

Title = {{Modelling and mapping tick dynamics using volunteered observations}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH GEOGRAPHICS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{NOV 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: Tick populations and tick-borne infections have steadily
   increased since the mid-1990s posing an ever-increasing risk to public
   health. Yet, modelling tick dynamics remains challenging because of the
   lack of data and knowledge on this complex phenomenon. Here we present
   an approach to model and map tick dynamics using volunteered data. This
   approach is illustrated with 9 years of data collected by a group of
   trained volunteers who sampled active questing ticks (AQT) on a monthly
   basis and for 15 locations in the Netherlands. We aimed at finding the
   main environmental drivers of AQT at multiple time-scales, and to devise
   daily AQT maps at the national level for 2014.
   Method: Tick dynamics is a complex ecological problem driven by biotic
   (e.g. pathogens, wildlife, humans) and abiotic (e.g. weather, landscape)
   factors. We enriched the volunteered AQT collection with six types of
   weather variables (aggregated at 11 temporal scales), three types of
   satellite-derived vegetation indices, land cover, and mast years. Then,
   we applied a feature engineering process to derive a set of 101 features
   to characterize the conditions that yielded a particular count of AQT on
   a date and location. To devise models predicting the AQT, we use a
   time-aware Random Forest regression method, which is suitable to find
   non-linear relationships in complex ecological problems, and provides an
   estimation of the most important features to predict the AQT.
   Results: We trained a model capable of fitting AQT with reduced
   statistical metrics. The multi-temporal study on the feature importance
   indicates that variables linked to water levels in the atmosphere (i.e.
   evapotranspiration, relative humidity) consistently showed a higher
   explanatory power than previous works using temperature. As a product of
   this study, we are able of mapping daily tick dynamics at the national
   level.
   Conclusions: This study paves the way towards the design of new
   applications in the fields of environmental research, nature management,
   and public health. It also illustrates how Citizen Science initiatives
   produce geospatial data collections that can support scientific
   analysis, thus enabling the monitoring of complex environmental
   phenomena.}},

Title = {{Using meta-quality to assess the utility of volunteered geographic
   information for science}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH GEOGRAPHICS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{NOV 6}},
Abstract = {{Background: Volunteered geographic information (VGI) has strong
   potential to be increasingly valuable to scientists in collaboration
   with non-scientists. The abundance of mobile phones and other wireless
   forms of communication open up significant opportunities for the public
   to get involved in scientific research. As these devices and activities
   become more abundant, questions of uncertainty and error in volunteer
   data are emerging as critical components for using volunteer-sourced
   spatial data.
   Methods: Here we present a methodology for using VGI and assessing its
   sensitivity to three types of error. More specifically, this study
   evaluates the reliability of data from volunteers based on their
   historical patterns. The specific context is a case study in
   surveillance of tsetse flies, a health concern for being the primary
   vector of African Trypanosomiasis.
   Results: Reliability, as measured by a reputation score, determines the
   threshold for accepting the volunteered data for inclusion in a tsetse
   presence/absence model. Higher reputation scores are successful in
   identifying areas of higher modeled tsetse prevalence. A dynamic
   threshold is needed but the quality of VGI will improve as more data are
   collected and the errors in identifying reliable participants will
   decrease.
   Conclusions: This system allows for two-way communication between
   researchers and the public, and a way to evaluate the reliability of
   VGI. Boosting the public's ability to participate in such work can
   improve disease surveillance and promote citizen science. In the absence
   of active surveillance, VGI can provide valuable spatial information
   given that the data are reliable.}},

Journal = {{ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Online collaborative communities are now ubiquitous. Identifying the
   nature of the events that drive contributors to withdraw from a project
   is of prime importance to ensure the sustainability of those
   communities. Previous studies used ad hoc criteria to identify withdrawn
   contributors, preventing comparisons between results and introducing
   interpretation biases. This paper compares different methods to identify
   withdrawn contributors, proposing a probabilistic approach. Withdrawals
   from the OpenStreetMap (OSM) community are investigated using time
   series and survival analyses. Survival analysis revealed that
   participants' withdrawal pattern compares with the life cycles studied
   in reliability engineering. For OSM contributors, this life cycle would
   translate into three phases: ``evaluation,{''} ``engagement{''} and
   ``detachment.{''} Time series analysis, when compared with the different
   events that may have affected the motivation of OSM participants over
   time, showed that an internal conflict about a license change was
   related to largest bursts of withdrawals in the history of the OSM
   project. This paper not only illustrates a formal approach to assess
   withdrawals from online communities, but also sheds new light on
   contributors' behavior, their life cycle, and events that may affect the
   length of their participation in such project.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED GEOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{88}},
Pages = {{174-185}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Research on disaster response frequently uses volunteered geographic
   information (VGI), due to its capability to provide near real-time
   information during and after a disaster. It is much less commonly used
   in spatial planning related to disaster management. However, VGI appears
   to have considerable potential for use in spatial planning and offers
   some advantages over traditional methods. For example, VGI can capture
   residents' preferences in a much faster, more timely, and more
   comprehensive fashion than is possible with, for example, questionnaires
   and surveys. This research investigates the usefulness of VGI for
   planning flood evacuation shelters. Using Jakarta, Indonesia, as a case
   study, we use VGI to capture the locations of flood evacuation shelters
   based on residents' preferences during flood periods in 2013-2014 and
   2014-2015 and compare these with the locations of official shelters.
   Floods frequently affect Jakarta and the city administration uses VGI in
   flood emergency responses. Moreover, Jakarta has been identified as
   having the largest number of active Twitter users among cities
   worldwide. Thus, Jakarta is an appropriate place to study the use of VGI
   for planning evacuation shelters. VGI generated by Twitter users was
   used to identify the shelter locations preferred by Jakarta residents,
   and more precisely the flood evacuees. Of 171,046 tweets using keywords
   relating to flood evacuation, the content of 306 tweets indicated that
   they had been sent from inside or near evacuation shelters. The spatial
   pattern showed that those tweets were sent from 215 locations, mostly
   located near flooded areas. The analysis further showed that 35.6\% of
   these shelter locations preferred by residents intersected with the
   locations of official evacuation shelters. As a general conclusion, our
   study demonstrates the advantages of using VGI for spatial planning,
   which mainly relates to the ease of capturing community preferences over
   a large area. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{There has been growing interest in using volunteered geographic
   information (VGI) for transportation planning, such as route data from
   fitness tracking applications and route mapping smartphone applications,
   as a compliment to traditional data collection approaches. In
   particular, cycling safety data from traditional sources are limited
   since bike crashes are under-reported and there are no central
   mechanisms for recording near misses. BikeMaps.org is a globally
   available website for cycling safety VGI, with a focus on spatial
   analyses of previously unrecorded near misses and collisions. The goal
   of this paper is to understand how age and gender are related to the use
   of BikeMaps.org compared to broader ridership and the geographic
   distribution of incidents for the Capital Regional District (CRD),
   British Columbia, Canada. Males aged 24-35 reported more incidents than
   other cohorts, which had similar relative proportions to the regional
   cycling population in origin-destination survey data. In general, there
   were higher levels of interaction with the website by younger people
   (i.e. submitting incidents vs. viewing incidents). Females and people
   under 35 years of age reported more incidents in central urban areas.
   People over 35 years of age reported incidents that were more spatially
   dispersed and covered a broader extent. These findings are indicative of
   both cycling behaviour and the use of technology. A target group for
   growth in cycling, females may benefit from improved cycling facilities
   in city centers. Older people may ride in cities more often if better
   facilities are provided. Understanding gaps in representation can help
   target more deliberate campaigns to complete data and inform the

   of Guangzhou}},
Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A longer, wider and more complicated change in the travel path is put
   forward to adapt to the rapidly increasing expansion of metropolises in
   the field of urban travel. Urban travel requires higher levels of
   sustainable urban transport. Therefore,this paper explores the circuity
   characteristics of urban travel and investigates the temporal
   relationship between time and travel circuity and the spatial
   relationship between distance and travel circuity to understand the
   efficiency of urban travel. Based on Guangzhou Taxi-GPS big data, travel
   circuity is considered in this paper to analyze the circuity spatial
   distribution and strength characteristics of urban travel in three types
   of metropolitan regions, including core areas, transition areas and
   fringe areas. Depending on the different attributes of the three types,
   the consistency and dissimilar characteristics of travel circuity and
   influencing factors of travel circuity in metropolises are discussed.
   The results are shown as follows: (1) by observing the temporal
   andspatial distribution of travel circuity, it can be found that peaks
   and troughs change with time, and travel circuity of transition areas is
   higher than other areas during the peak period. When travelling in these
   three regions, travel circuity spatial distribution is consistent, which
   is the core-periphery distribution. When travelling among these three
   regions, travel circuity spatial distribution is distinct; (2) by
   analyzing the relationship between time and distance of travel and

Abstract = {{Photovoltaics (PV) is the fastest-growing renewable energy source at the
   global level and Italy has been one of the Pioneers of such growth, now
   being one of the Countries with the largest installed PV capacity -
   absolute, per unit area, and per capita. In this paper we investigated
   the impact of PV on land use in the area with the highest density of PV
   farms in Italy, i.e. the Province of Lecce (Southeastern Italy): here,
   such impact is expected to be maximum and has been the subject of public
   debate. In order to map all PV farms in detail, we used participative
   cartography, specifically OpenStreetMap (OSM), as data source. This
   international project collects geographic information (often gathered by
   people - i.e. the so-called Volunteered Geographic Information, VGI -
   using widely available technologies, such as smartphone built-in GPS),
   in order to create freely available global topographic maps. In this
   paper, we used the OSM platform to create a Geographical Information
   System (GIS) of PV farms in the Province of Lecce. Using GIS-based
   techniques, we estimated land use at the municipality level and created
   a density map of PV farms within the study area. Using the official land
   cover map Corine Land Cover of 2012, we also evaluated the main changes
   in land use. The results highlight the correlation between spatial
   distribution of PV farms and geographic variables (geomorphology,
   demographics, tourism, etc). We also show that land take by PV farms is
   quite marginal even in a region such as the Province of Lecce, where the
   density of PV installed power is among the highest available at the
   global level. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{While the term ``volunteered geographic information{''} (VGI) has become
   a buzzword in debates on the geoweb, online cartography and digital
   geoinformation, the scope and reach of VGI remains underexplored.
   Drawing on literature on social implications of VGI, this article,
   firstly, explores differences between VGI initiatives at the example of
   a comparative case study on social biases within data of OSM and
   Wikimapia in the fragmented social setting of Jerusalem, Israel. The
   results of this analysis turn out to be highly contradictive between
   both projects, which challenges widely accepted assumptions on the
   imprint of social inequalities and digital divides on VGI. This
   observation guides, secondly, a discussion of diversity within the
   category of VGI. Arguing that mapping communities, data formats and
   knowledge types behind VGI are extremely dissimilar, the paper proceeds
   by questioning the consistency and utility of VGI as a category. Seeking
   for a more comprehensive typology of VGI, Edney's notion of cartographic
   modes will be presented as an approach towards a more contextualized
   understanding of VGI projects by embracing their underlying cultural,
   social and technical relations. Consequently, the paper suggests
   empirical research on the cartographic modes of a broad series of VGI
   projects through qualitative and quantitative methods alike.}},

Abstract = {{As large amounts of trajectories from a wide variety of Volunteered
   Geographic Information (referred to as VGI) contributors pour into the

   generated from these trajectories are different from the ground truth
   road dataset and so need to be differently assessed. To address this
   issue, an assessment approach based on symmetric arc similarity is
   proposed, and the geometric quality of a VGI road network is assessed by
   its conformity with the corresponding ground truth road network, the
   results being visualized as hierarchical thematic maps. To compute the
   conformity, the geometric similarity between the VGI road arc and the
   corresponding ground truth road arc, which is selected by the adaptive
   searching distance, is measured based on the symmetric arc similarity
   method; the geometric quality is assessed based on an assessment matrix.
   Also, the symmetric arc similarity method is independent of directions
   and with a feature of shift-independence, which is applicable to assess
   the geometric qualities of different VGI road networks and makes the
   assessment result consistent with the actual situation of the real

Abstract = {{The recent trend toward open Earth observation ( EO) data has revived a
   general interest in satellite-based monitoring and mapping of the Earth
   surface. The open policy now applied to LANDSAT data, and the starting
   of Sentinel operations, whose data are freely distributed even for
   commercial purposes, tore down a financial barrier to wider use of EO
   data in business activities, especially those with a narrow financial
   margin. Notwithstanding the flood of open data, some aspects of the
   Earth surface still escape satisfactory monitoring from space,
   especially in complex, anthropic areas. Due to insufficient spatial
   resolution, lack of visibility, or unsuitable revisit times, important
   pieces of information may not emerge from spaceborne data. In situ
   sensing can represent a vital source of integrative information to fill
   the aforementioned gaps and build a more complete and accurate picture
   of the situation and trends in the observed area. The contribution of in
   situ sensing was envisaged quite early in the Earth observation history,
   but for a long time it remained limited to tailored sensors displaced in
   strategic locations. With the increasing circulation of smartphones, a
   new opportunity has recently opened for a different paradigm of in situ
   sensing, offering a huge mass of additional data by tapping on data
   generated by mobile devices. Even if such data may be less specialized
   and less usable for various reasons, the sheer size of the data flow
   ensures that statistical analysis will pick possible useful clues. The
   increasing availability of mobile connections has indeed revived the
   concept of ``crowdsourcing,{''}i.e., entrusting a pool of actors with
   problem solution or information collection tasks. In our scenario,
   individuals carrying mobile devices can become ``citizen sensors{''} on
   a voluntary basis by contributing data through their connected
   terminals. Even considering the typical issues of crowdsourced data,
   like quality and reliability, the balance remains definitely positive.
   This paper provides an overview of the theme and discusses how it
   relates to an important, coordinated EO initiative like Copernicus. It
   finally presents a specific example realized in the framework of a
   recent research project under the Copernicus aegis.}},

Journal = {{DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{102}},
Pages = {{22-31}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{When using tweets to predict population health index, due to the large
   scale of data, an aggregation of tweets by population has been a popular
   practice in learning features to characterize the population. This would
   alleviate the computational cost for extracting features on each
   individual tweet. On the other hand, much information on the population
   could be lost as the distribution of textual features of a population
   could be important for identifying the health index of that population.
   In addition, there could be relationships between features and those
   relationships could also convey predictive information of the health
   index. In this paper, we propose mid-level features namely kernel-based
   features for prediction of health indices of populations from social
   media data. The kernel-based features are extracted on the distributions
   of textual features over population tweets and encode the relationships
   between individual textual features in a kernel function. We implemented
   our features using three different kernel functions and applied them for
   two case studies of population health prediction: across-year prediction
   and across-county prediction. The kernel-based features were evaluated
   and compared with existing features on a dataset collected from the
   Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System dataset. Experimental results
   show that the kernel-based features gained significantly higher
   prediction performance than existing techniques, by up to 16.3\%,
   suggesting the potential and applicability of the proposed features in a
   wide spectrum of applications on data analytics at population levels.

Abstract = {{Volunteered geographic information (VGI) has been heralded as a

Abstract = {{The availability of spatial data is a key concern in protected area
   management, including visitor management. Obtaining spatial data is
   often laborious and expensive. New approaches involving the general
   public in data collection can provide a solution. Among existing
   crowdsourcing initiatives, OpenStreetMap (OSM) is the largest. But,
   while public participation geographic information systems (PPGIS),
   volunteered geographic information (VGI), and user-generated content
   (UGC) are used in visitor management, OSM still receives less attention.
   n this paper, questions regarding the possibilities of using OSM data in
   visitor management are discussed. The focus is on recreational
   infrastructure data, since infrastructure is an important means for
   guiding and managing visitors. The Berchtesgaden National Park (Germany)
   served as the study area. A list of the relevant elements of the
   recreational infrastructure in the protected area was elaborated, and an
   analysis was carried out to determine how useful the OSM tagging system
   is for describing these elements. In addition, data held in the OSM
   database was assessed first with regard to which infrastructure elements
   the OSM database holds data for, and second for the amount of data held.
   Along with the benefits, there are also challenges in using OSM. Thus,
   there is a need to expand the OSM tagging system to allow the

   Geographic Information}},
Journal = {{ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Integrated pest management (IPM) involves integrating multiple pest
   control methods based on site information obtained through inspection,
   monitoring, and reports. IPM has been deployed to achieve the judicious
   use of pesticides and has become one of the most important methods of
   securing agricultural productivity. Despite the efforts made to
   strengthen IPM during the past decades, overuse as well as
   indiscriminate use of pesticides is still common. This problem is
   particularly serious in underserved farming communities which suffer
   from ineffectiveness with respect to pest management information
   collection and dissemination. The recent development of volunteered
   geographic information (VGI) offers an opportunity to the general public
   to create and receive ubiquitous, cost-effective, and timely geospatial
   information. Therefore, this study proposes to enhance IPM through
   establishing a VGI-based IPM. As a starting point of this line of
   research, this study explored how such geospatial information can
   contribute to IPM enhancement. Based on this, a conceptual framework of
   VGI interaction was built to guide the establishment of VGI-based IPM.
   To implement VGI-based IPM, a mobile phone platform was developed. In
   addition, a case study was conducted in the town of Shuibian in Jiangxi
   province of China to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
   approach. In the case study, by analyzing infestation incidents of an
   overwintering outbreak of striped rice stem borers voluntarily reported
   by farmers through mobile phones, spatiotemporal infestation patterns of
   the borers throughout the study area were revealed and disseminated to
   the farmers. These patterns include the dates and degree-days the pest
   infestations intensified, and the orientation or spatial structural
   variations of the clustering of the infestations. This case study
   showcased the unique merit of VGI in enhancing IPM, namely the
   acquisition of previously unrecorded spatial data in a cost-effective
   and real-time manner for discovering and disseminating previously
   unknown pest management knowledge.}},

   mapping purposes. As main case study, we used Foursquare place data for
   estimating nonresidential building block use in the city of Amsterdam.
   Based on the Foursquare place categories, we estimated the use of 9827
   building blocks, and we compared the classification results with a
   reference building block use dataset. Our evaluation metric is the kappa
   coefficient, which determines if the classification results are
   significantly better than a random guess result. Using the optimal set
   of parameter values, we achieved the highest kappa coefficient values
   for the land use categories hotels, restaurants and cafes (0.76) and
   retail (0.65). The lowest kappa coefficients were found for the land use
   categories industries and storage and unclear. We have also applied the

Abstract = {{Land cover change (LCC) can have a significant impact on human and
   environmental well-being. LCC maps derived from historical remote
   sensing (RS) images are often used to evaluate the impacts of past LC
   changes and to construct models to predict future LC changes. Free
   moderate spatial resolution (-30 m) optical and synthetic aperture radar
   (SAR) RS imagery is now becoming increasingly available for this LCC
   monitoring. However, the classification algorithms used to extract LC
   information from these images typically require ``training data{''} for
   classification (i.e. points or polygons with LC class labels), and
   acquiring this labelled training data can be difficult and
   time-consuming. Alternatively, crowdsourced geographic data (CGD) has
   become widely available from online sources like OpenStreetMap (OSM),
   and it may provide a useful source of training data for LCC monitoring.
   A major challenge with utilizing CGD for LCC mapping, however, is the
   presence of class labelling errors, and these errors can vary spatially
   (e.g. due to differing levels of CGD contributor expertise) and
   temporally (e.g. due to time lag between CGD creation and RS imagery
   acquisition). In this study, we investigated a new LCC mapping method
   which utilizes free Landsat (optical) and PALSAR mosaic (SAR) satellite
   imagery in combination with labelled LC data extracted from CGD sources
   (the OSM ``landuse{''} and ``natural{''} polygon datasets). A
   semi-unsupervised classification approach was employed for the LCC
   mapping to reduce the effects of class label noise in the CGD. The main
   motivation and benefit of the proposed method is that it does not
   require training data to be manually collected, allowing for a faster
   and more automated assessment of LCC. As a case study, we applied the
   method to map LCC in the Laguna de Bay area of the Philippines over the
   2007-2015 period. The LCC map produced using our proposed approach
   achieved an overall classification accuracy of 90.2\%, providing
   evidence that CGD and multi-temporal/multi-sensor satellite imagery,
   when combined, have a great potential for LCC monitoring. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{Global land cover is an essential climate variable and a key biophysical

   lacking. Here we describe the global land cover and land use reference
   data derived from the Geo-Wiki crowdsourcing platform via four

Abstract = {{As businesses and governments integrate OpenStreetMap (OSM) into their
   services in ways that require comprehensive coverage, there is a need to
   expand research outside of major urban areas and consider the strength
   of the map in smaller cities. A place-specific inquiry into the OSM
   contributor sets in small cities allows an intimate look at user
   motives, locations, and editing habits that are readily described in the
   OSM metadata and user profile pages, but often missed by aggregate
   studies of OSM data. Using quantitative and qualitative evidence from
   the OSM history of five small cities across North and South America, I
   show that OSM is not accumulating large local corpuses of editors
   outside of major urban areas. In these more remote places OSM remains
   largely at the mercy of an unpredictable mix of casual contributions,
   business interests, feature-specific ``hobbyists'', bots, and importers,
   all passing through the map at different scales for different reasons. I
   present a typology of roles played by contributors as they expand and
   fix OSM in casual, systematic, and automated fashion. I argue that these
   roles are too complex to be conceptualized with the traditional
   ``citizen as sensor'' model of understanding volunteered geographic
   information. While some contributors are driven by pride of place,
   others are more interested in improving map quality or ensuring certain
   feature types are represented. Institutions considering the use of OSM
   data in their projects should be aware of these varied influences and
   their potential effects on the data.}},

Journal = {{ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{103}},
Pages = {{65-71}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Real and perceived concerns about cycling safety are a barrier to
   increased ridership in many cities. Many people prefer to bike on
   facilities separated from motor vehicles, such as multiuse trails.
   However, due to underreporting, cities lack data on bike collisions,
   especially along greenways and multiuse paths. We used a crowdsourced
   cycling incident dataset (2005-2016) from BikeMaps.org for the Capital
   Regional District (CRD), BC, Canada. Our goal was to identify design
   characteristics associated with unsafe intersections between multiuse
   trails and roads. 92.8\% of mapped incidents occurred between 2014 and
   2016. We extracted both collision and near miss incidents at
   intersections from BikeMaps.org. We conducted site observations at 32
   intersections where a major multiuse trail intersected with roads. We
   compared attributes of reported incidents at multiuse trail -road
   intersections to those at road -road intersections. We then used
   negative binomial regression to model the relationship between the
   number of incidents and the infrastructure characteristics at multiuse
   trail -road intersections. We found a higher proportion of collisions
   (38\%, or 17/45 total reports) at multiuse trail -road intersections
   compared to road -road intersections (23\%, or 62/268 total reports). A
   higher proportion of incidents resulted in an injury at multiuse trail
   -road intersections compared to road -road intersections (33\% versus
   15\%). Cycling volumes, vehicle volumes, and trail sight distance were
   all associated with incident frequency at multiuse trail road
   intersections. Supplementing traditional crash records with crowdsourced
   cycling incident data provides valuable evidence on cycling safety at
   intersections between multiuse trails and roads, and more generally,
   when conflicts occur between diverse transportation modes.}},

Abstract = {{Policymakers pay much attention to effectively increasing frequency of

   cities. Investigating associations of environmental characteristics and
   cycling behaviour could offer implications for changing urban
   infrastructure aiming at encouraging active travel. However, earlier
   examinations of associations between environmental characteristics and
   active travel behaviour are limited by low spatial granularity and
   coverage of traditional data. Crowdsourced geographic information offers
   an opportunity to determine the fine-grained travel patterns of people.
   Particularly, Strava Metro data offer a good opportunity for studies of
   recreational cycling behaviour as they can offer hourly, daily or annual
   cycling volumes with different purposes (commuting or recreational) in
   each street across a city. Therefore, in this study, we utilised Strava
   Metro data for investigating associations between environmental
   characteristics and recreational cycling behaviour at a large spatial
   scale (street level). In this study, we took account of population
   density, employment density, road length, road connectivity, proximity
   to public transit services, land use mix, proximity to green space,
   volume of motor vehicles and traffic accidents in an empirical

Abstract = {{Fine-scale population distribution data at the building level play an
   essential role in numerous fields, for example urban planning and
   disaster prevention. The rapid technological development of remote
   sensing (RS) and geographical information system (GIS) in recent decades
   has benefited numerous population distribution mapping studies. However,
   most of these studies focused on global population and environmental
   changes; few considered fine-scale population mapping at the local
   scale, largely because of a lack of reliable data and models. As
   geospatial big data booms, Internet-collected volunteered geographic
   information (VGI) can now be used to solve this problem. This article
   establishes a novel framework to map urban population distributions at
   the building scale by integrating multisource geospatial big data, which
   is essential for the fine-scale mapping of population distributions.
   First, Baidu points-of-interest (POIs) and real-time Tencent user
   densities (RTUD) are analyzed by using a random forest algorithm to
   down-scale the street-level population distribution to the grid level.
   Then, we design an effective iterative building-population gravity model
   to map population distributions at the building level. Meanwhile, we
   introduce a densely inhabited index (DII), generated by the proposed
   gravity model, which can be used to estimate the degree of residential
   crowding. According to a comparison with official community-level census
   data and the results of previous population mapping methods, our method
   exhibits the best accuracy (Pearson R=.8615, RMSE=663.3250, p<.0001).
   The produced fine-scale population map can offer a more thorough
   understanding of inner city population distributions, which can thus
   help policy makers optimize the allocation of resources.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) has increasingly
   gained attractiveness to both amateur users and professionals. Using
   data generated from the crowd has become a hot topic for several
   application domains including transportation. However, there are
   concerns regarding the quality of such datasets. As one of the most
   famous crowdsourced mapping platforms, we analyze the fitness for use of
   OpenStreetMap (OSM) database for routing and navigation of people with
   limited mobility. We assess the completeness of OSM data regarding
   sidewalk information. Relevant attributes for sidewalk information such
   as sidewalk width, incline, surface texture, etc. are considered, and
   through both extrinsic and intrinsic quality analysis methods, we
   present the results of fitness for use of OSM data for routing services
   of disabled persons. Based on empirical results, it is concluded that
   OSM data of relatively large spatial extents inside all studied cities
   could be an acceptable region of interest to test and evaluate
   wheelchair routing and navigation services, as long as other data
   quality parameters such as positional accuracy and logical consistency
   are checked and proved to be acceptable. We present an extended version
   of OSMatrix web service and explore how it is employed to perform
   spatial and temporal analysis of sidewalk data completeness in OSM. The
   tool is beneficial for piloting activities, whereas the pilot site
   planners can query OpenStreetMap and visualize the degree of sidewalk
   data availability in a certain region of interest. This would allow
   identifying the areas that data are mostly missing and plan for data
   collection events. Furthermore, empirical results of data completeness
   for several OSM data indicators and their potential relation to sidewalk
   data completeness are presented and discussed. Finally, the article ends
   with an outlook for future research study in this area.}},

Abstract = {{During the last decade, web technologies and location sensing devices
   have evolved generating a form of crowdsourcing known as Volunteered
   Geographic Information (VGI). VGI acted as a platform of spatial data
   collection, in particular, when a group of public participants are
   involved in collaborative mapping activities: they work together to
   collect, share, and use information about geographic features. VGI
   exploits participants' local knowledge to produce rich data sources.
   However, the resulting data inherits problematic data classification. In
   VGI projects, the challenges of data classification are due to the
   following: (i) data is likely prone to subjective classification, (ii)
   remote contributions and flexible contribution mechanisms in most
   projects, and (iii) the uncertainty of spatial data and non-strict
   definitions of geographic features. These factors lead to various forms
   of problematic classification: inconsistent, incomplete, and imprecise
   data classification. This research addresses classification
   appropriateness. Whether the classification of an entity is appropriate
   or inappropriate is related to quantitative and/or qualitative
   observations. Small differences between observations may be not
   recognizable particularly for non-expert participants. Hence, in this
   paper, the problem is tackled by developing a rule-guided classification
   approach. This approach exploits data mining techniques of Association
   Classification (AC) to extract descriptive (qualitative) rules of
   specific geographic features. The rules are extracted based on the
   investigation of qualitative topological relations between target
   features and their context. Afterwards, the extracted rules are used to
   develop a recommendation system able to guide participants to the most
   appropriate classification. The approach proposes two scenarios to guide
   participants towards enhancing the quality of data classification. An
   empirical study is conducted to investigate the classification of
   grass-related features like forest, garden, park, and meadow. The
   findings of this study indicate the feasibility of the proposed
   approach. (C) 2016 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote

   Safecast data by comparing Safecast data with authoritative data
   collected by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the U.S. National
   Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) gathered in the Fukushima
   Prefecture shortly after the Daiichi nuclear power plant catastrophe. We
   found that the two data sets were highly correlated, though the DOE/NNSA

Abstract = {{Flood events cause substantial damage to urban and rural areas.
   Monitoring water extent during large-scale flooding is crucial in order
   to identify the area affected and to evaluate damage. During such
   events, spatial assessments of floodwater may be derived from satellite
   or airborne sensing platforms. Meanwhile, an increasing availability of
   smartphones is leading to documentation of flood events directly by
   individuals, with information shared in real-time using social media.
   Topographic data, which can be used to determine where floodwater can
   accumulate, are now often available from national mapping or
   governmental repositories. In this work, we present and evaluate a
   method for rapidly estimating flood inundation extent based on a model
   that fuses remote sensing, social media and topographic data sources.
   Using geotagged photographs sourced from social media, optical remote
   sensing and high-resolution terrain mapping, we develop a Bayesian
   statistical model to estimate the probability of flood inundation
   through weights-of-evidence analysis. Our experiments were conducted
   using data collected during the 2014 UK flood event and focus on the
   Oxford city and surrounding areas. Using the proposed technique,
   predictions of inundation were evaluated against ground-truth flood
   extent. The results report on the quantitative accuracy of the
   multisource mapping process, which obtained area under receiver
   operating curve values of 0.95 and 0.93 for model fitting and testing,
   respectively.}},

   OpenStreetMap and GlobeLand30}},
Journal = {{ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{With the opening up of the Landsat archive, global high resolution land
   cover maps have begun to appear. However, they often have only a small
   number of high level land cover classes and they are static products,
   corresponding to a particular period of time, e.g., the GlobeLand30
   (GL30) map for 2010. The OpenStreetMap (OSM), in contrast, consists of a
   very detailed, dynamically updated, spatial database of mapped features
   from around the world, but it suffers from incomplete coverage, and
   layers of overlapping features that are tagged in a variety of ways.
   However, it clearly has potential for land use and land cover (LULC)
   mapping. Thus the aim of this paper is to demonstrate how the OSM can be
   converted into a LULC map and how this OSM-derived LULC map can then be
   used to first update the GL30 with more recent information and secondly,
   enhance the information content of the classes. The technique is
   demonstrated on two study areas where there is availability of OSM data
   but in locations where authoritative data are lacking, i.e., Kathmandu,
   Nepal and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The GL30 and its updated and enhanced
   versions are independently validated using a stratified random sample so
   that the three maps can be compared. The results show that the updated
   version of GL30 improves in terms of overall accuracy since certain
   classes were not captured well in the original GL30 (e.g., water in
   Kathmandu and water/wetlands in Dar es Salaam). In contrast, the
   enhanced GL30, which contains more detailed urban classes, results in a
   drop in the overall accuracy, possibly due to the increased number of
   classes, but the advantages include the appearance of more detailed
   features, such as the road network, that becomes clearly visible.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) has progressed
   from being an exotic prospect to making a profound impact on GIScience
   and geography in general, as initially anticipated. However, while
   massive and manifold data is continuously produced voluntarily and
   applications are built for information and knowledge extraction, the
   initially introduced concept of VGI lacks certain methodological
   perspectives in this regard which have not been fully elaborated. In
   this article we highlight and discuss an important gap in this concept,
   i.e. the lack of formal acknowledgment of temporal aspects. By coining
   the proposed advanced framework `Volunteered Geo-Dynamic Information'
   (VGDI), we attempt to lay the ground for full conceptual and applied
   spatio-temporal integration. To illustrate that integrative approach of
   VGDI and its benefits, we describe the potential impact on the field of
   dynamic population distribution modeling. While traditional approaches
   in that domain rely on survey-based data and statistics as well as
   static geographic information, the use of VGDI enables a dynamic setup.
   Foursquare venue and user check-in data are presented for a test site in
   Lisbon, Portugal. Two core modules of spatio-temporal population
   assessment are thereby addressed, namely time use profiling and target
   zone characterization, motivated by the potential integration in
   existing population dynamics frameworks such as the DynaPop model.}},

Abstract = {{Social media is valuable in propagating information during disasters for
   its timely and available characteristics nowadays, and assists in making
   decisions when tagged with locations. Considering the ambiguity and
   inaccuracy in some social data, additional authoritative data are needed
   for important verification. However, current works often fail to
   leverage both social and authoritative data and, on most occasions, the
   data are used in disaster analysis after the fact. Moreover, current
   works organize the data from the perspective of the spatial location,
   but not from the perspective of the disaster, making it difficult to
   dynamically analyze the disaster. All of the disaster-related data
   around the affected locations need to be retrieved. To solve these
   limitations, this study develops a geo-event-based geospatial
   information service (GEGIS) framework and proceeded as follows: (1) a
   geo-event-related ontology was constructed to provide a uniform semantic
   basis for the system; (2) geo-events and attributes were extracted from
   the web using a natural language process (NLP) and used in the semantic
   similarity match of the geospatial resources; and (3) a geospatial
   information service prototype system was designed and implemented for
   automatically retrieving and organizing geo-event-related geospatial
   resources. A case study of a typhoon hazard is analyzed here within the
   GEGIS and shows that the system would be effective when typhoons occur.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Individualization of tenure through title registration programmes
   introduced in many African countries after independence with the promise
   of security of tenure and increased agricultural productivity has,
   instead, had the opposite effect. Informal land arrangements continue to
   emerge as a result of the slow pace of land adjudication (formalization)
   and updating of land information systems. The trend towards
   computerization of land information systems has only put focus on
   already existing formal land tenure arrangements, leaving out the
   informal social tenure arrangements. As a result, there are now many
   efforts worldwide motivated by the introduction of the Social Tenure
   Domain Model (STDM), and freely available and easy-to-use technology
   tools to identify, document and map land in support of informal land
   administration arrangements. Actions are made towards the use of
   community-generated information to support land administration. Using
   theories from the interplay between formal and informal institutions,
   this paper discusses the potential outcomes in adopting Volunteered
   Geographic Information (VGI) in land administration in Kenya. Two case
   studies are presented that demonstrate the complementary-accommodating,
   versus the substitutive-competing approaches. These are then compared
   with the formal land adjudication process in Kenya. It is established
   that because of the direct involvement of the national mapping agency in
   land adjudication where VGI is utilized, the outcome is a case of formal
   adoption of VGI, while in the other case, where there is little or no
   involvement by the national mapping agency, the outcome is more of
   competition and substitution. The latter is an example in which the VGI
   is used just like any other information to inform policy making, rather
   than taking it as the authoritative source. We argue that since
   informality is - and will always be - part and parcel of land
   administration in many African countries as a result of ingrained social
   relations and power structures, adopting crowdsourced land information
   into existing formal land administration systems should consider the
   particular land administration process, satisfying innate demands and
   requirements, thus re-engineered to accommodate VGI. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Abstract = {{With the development of information and communications technology,
   user-generated content and crowdsourced data are playing a large role in
   studies of transport and public health. Recently, Strava, a popular
   website and mobile app dedicated to tracking athletic activity (cycling
   and running), began offering a data service called Strava Metro,
   designed to help transportation researchers and urban planners to
   improve infrastructure for cyclists and pedestrians. Strava Metro data
   has the potential to promote studies of cycling and health by indicating
   where commuting and non-commuting cycling activities are at a large
   spatial scale (street level and intersection level). The assessment of
   spatially varying effects of air pollution during active travel (cycling
   or walking) might benefit from Strava Metro data, as a variation in air
   pollution levels within a city would be expected. In this paper, to
   explore the potential of Strava Metro data in research of active travel
   and health, we investigate spatial patterns of non-commuting cycling
   activities and associations between cycling purpose (commuting and
   non-commuting) and air pollution exposure at a large scale.
   Additionally, we attempt to estimate the number of non-commuting cycling
   trips according to environmental characteristics that may help identify
   cycling behavior. Researchers who are undertaking studies relating to
   cycling purpose could benefit from this approach in their use of cycling
   trip data sets that lack trip purpose. We use the Strava Metro Nodes
   data from Glasgow, United Kingdom in an empirical study. Empirical
   results reveal some findings that (1) when compared with commuting
   cycling activities, non-commuting cycling activities are more likely to
   be located in outskirts of the city; (2) spatially speaking, cyclists
   riding for recreation and other purposes are more likely to be exposed
   to relatively low levels of air pollution than cyclists riding for
   commuting; and (3) the method for estimating of the number of
   non-commuting cycling activities works well in this study. The results
   highlight: (1) a need for policymakers to consider how to improve
   cycling infrastructure and road safety in outskirts of cities; and (2) a
   possible way of estimating the number of non-commuting cycling
   activities when the trip purpose of cycling data is unknown.}},

Abstract = {{Volunteer geographical information (VGI), either in the context of
   citizen science or the mining of social media, has proven to be useful
   in various domains including natural hazards, health status, disease
   epidemics, and biological monitoring. Nonetheless, the variable or
   unknown data quality due to crowdsourcing settings are still an obstacle
   for fully integrating these data sources in environmental studies and
   potentially in policy making. The data curation process, in which a
   quality assurance (QA) is needed, is often driven by the direct
   usability of the data collected within a data conflation process or data
   fusion (DCDF), combining the crowdsourced data into one view, using
   potentially other data sources as well. Looking at current practices in
   VGI data quality and using two examples, namely land cover validation
   and inundation extent estimation, this paper discusses the close links
   between QA and DCDF. It aims to help in deciding whether a
   disentanglement can be possible, whether beneficial or not, in
   understanding the data curation process with respect to its methodology
   for future usage of crowdsourced data. Analysing situations throughout
   the data curation process where and when entanglement between QA and
   DCDF occur, the paper explores the various facets of VGI data capture,
   as well as data quality assessment and purposes. Far from rejecting the
   usability ISO quality criterion, the paper advocates for a decoupling of
   the QA process and the DCDF step as much as possible while still
   integrating them within an approach analogous to a Bayesian paradigm.}},

Abstract = {{Static geosensor networks are comprised of stations with sensor devices
   providing data relevant for monitoring environmental phenomena in their
   geographic perimeter. Although early warning systems for disaster
   management rely on data retrieved from these networks, some limitations
   exist, largely in terms of insufficient coverage and low density.
   Crowdsourcing user-generated data is emerging as a working methodology
   for retrieving real-time data in disaster situations, reducing the
   aforementioned limitations, and augmenting with real-time data generated
   voluntarily by nearby citizens. This paper explores the use of
   crowdsourced user-generated sensor weather data from mobile devices for
   the creation of a unified and densified geosensor network. Different
   scenario experiments are adapted, in which weather data are collected
   using smartphone sensors, integrated with the development of a
   stabilization algorithm, for determining the user-generated weather data
   reliability and usability. Showcasing this methodology on a large data
   volume, a spatiotemporal algorithm was developed for filtering on-line
   user-generated weather data retrieved from WeatherSignal, and used for
   simulation and assessment of densifying the static geosensor weather
   network of Israel. Geostatistical results obtained proved that, although
   user-generated weather data show small discrepancies when compared to
   authoritative data, with considerations they can be used alongside
   authoritative data, producing a densified and augmented weather map that
   is detailed and continuous.}},

Title = {{OpenStreetMap in Israel and Palestine - `Game changer' or reproducer of
   contested cartographies?}},
Journal = {{POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{57}},
Pages = {{34-48}},

Abstract = {{In Israel and Palestine, map-making practices were always entangled with
   contradictive spatial identities and imbalanced power resources.
   Although an Israeli narrative has largely dominated the `cartographic
   battlefield', the latest chapter of this story has not been written yet:
   collaborative forms of web 2.0 cartographies have restructured power
   relations in mapping practices and challenged traditional monopolies on
   map and spatial data production. Thus, we can expect web 2.0
   cartographies to be a `game changer' for cartography in Palestine and
   Israel. In this paper, I review this assumption with the popular example
   of OpenStreetMap (OSM). Following a mixed methods approach, I
   comparatively analyze the genesis of OSM in Israel and Palestine.
   Although nationalist motives do not play a significant role on either
   side, it turns out that the project is dominated by Israeli and
   international mappers, whereas Palestinians have hardly contributed to
   OSM. As a result, social fragmentations and imbalances between Israel
   and Palestine are largely reproduced through OSM data. Discussing the
   low involvement of Palestinians, I argue that OSM`s ground truth
   paradigm might be a watershed for participation. Presumably, the
   project's data are less meaningful in some local contexts than in
   others. Moreover, the seemingly apolitical approach to map only `facts
   on the ground' reaffirms present spatio-social order and thus the power
   relations behind it. Within a Palestinian narrative, however, many
   aspects of the factual material space might appear not as neutral
   physical objects but as results of suppression, in which case, any
   `accurate' spatial representation, such as OSM, becomes objectionable.

Volume = {{86}},

Abstract = {{The impact of natural hazards on mankind has increased dramatically over
   the past decades. Global urbanization processes and increasing spatial
   concentrations of exposed elements induce natural hazard risk at a
   uniquely high level. To mitigate affiliated perils requires detailed
   knowledge about elements at risk. Considering a high spatiotemporal
   variability of elements at risk, detailed information is costly in terms
   of both time and economic resources and therefore often incomplete,
   aggregated, or outdated. To alleviate these restrictions, the
   availability of very-high-resolution satellite images promotes accurate
   and detailed analysis of exposure over various spatial scales with
   large-area coverage. In the past, valuable approaches were proposed;
   however, the design of information extraction procedures with a high
   level of automatization remains challenging. In this paper, we uniquely
   combine remote sensing data and volunteered geographic information from
   the OpenStreetMap project (OSM) (i.e., freely accessible geospatial
   information compiled by volunteers) for a highly automated estimation of
   crucial exposure components (i.e., number of buildings and population)
   with a high level of spatial detail. To this purpose, we first obtain
   labeled training segments from the OSM data in conjunction with the
   satellite imagery. This allows for learning a supervised algorithmic
   model (i.e., rotation forest) in order to extract relevant thematic
   classes of land use/land cover (LULC) from the satellite imagery.
   Extracted information is jointly deployed with information from the OSM
   data to estimate the number of buildings with regression techniques
   (i.e., a multi-linear model from ordinary least-square optimization and
   a nonlinear support vector regression model are considered).
   Analogously, urban LULC information is used in conjunction with OSM data
   to spatially disaggregate population information. Experimental results
   were obtained for the city of Valparaiso in Chile. Thereby, we
   demonstrate the relevance of the approaches by estimating number of
   affected buildings and population referring to a historical tsunami
   event.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the development of an ``Internet+{''} approach to
   mapping exposure and seismic vulnerability of buildings in a context of
   rapid socioeconomic growth. This approach is a combination of the
   following interdependent components: (1) extraction of footprint areas
   of a large number of buildings from high-resolution Google Earth images;
   (2) estimation of floor numbers of these buildings with an integrated
   use of high-resolution Google Earth images, Tencent/Baidu Street Views,
   crowdsourcing data, and associated building-relevant local knowledge;
   and (3) identification of structural types of these buildings by a
   combined use of crowdsourcing data and associated building-relevant
   local knowledge. The efficacy of this ``Internet+{''} approach was
   demonstrated through an application in Tangshan, China. Field-based
   verification indicated that the overall mean absolute percentage error
   of the proposed ``Internet+{''} approach in assessing the total floor
   area of the addressed buildings was 4.64 \%. The verification also
   showed that the overall consistency between the estimated structural
   types using the proposed approach and the actual structural types of the
   buildings with structural type uncertainties could reach 97.54 \%, with
   a kappa coefficient of 0.94. Because of its good accuracy, noteworthy
   speed, substantial labor savings, negligible cost and distinctive
   capability in covering large areas in near real time, this
   ``Internet+{''} approach might have promising prospects in actual
   seismic loss risk reduction challenges.}},

Abstract = {{The current popularity of government open data platforms as a way to
   share geospatial data has created an opportunity for government to

   proposes four models that can define how government accepts direct edits

   open data provision, data curation, data mirroring, and crowdsourcing.
   These models are placed on a continuum of government control ranging
   from high levels of control over data creation to a low level of
   control. Each model is discussed, with relevant challenges highlighted.
   These four models present an initial suite of options for governments
   looking to accept direct edits from data end users and can be framed as
   a partial realization of many of the principles of open government.
   Despite the varied potential of these approaches, they generate a shift
   in locus of control away from government, creating several areas of risk

Abstract = {{When producing optimal routes through an environment, considering the
   incline of surfaces can be of great benefit in a number of use cases.
   For instance, steep segments need to be avoided for energy-efficient
   routes and for routes that are suitable for mobility-restricted people.
   Such incline information may be derived from digital elevation models
   (DEMs). However, the corresponding data capturing methods (e.g. airborne
   LiDAR, photogrammetry, and terrestrial surveying) are expensive. Current
   low-cost and open-licensed DEM (e.g. Shuttle Radar Topography Mission
   {[}SRTM] and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection
   Radiometer {[}ASTER]) generally do not have sufficient horizontal
   resolution or vertical accuracy, and lack a global coverage. Therefore,
   we have investigated an alternative low-cost approach which derives
   street incline values from GPS traces that have been voluntarily
   collected by the OpenStreetMap contributors. Despite the poor absolute
   accuracy of this data, the relative accuracy of traces seems to be
   sufficient enough to compute incline values with reasonable accuracy. A
   validation shows that the accuracy of incline values calculated from GPS
   traces slightly outperforms incline values derived from SRTM-1 DEM,

Title = {{Coverage inequality and quality of volunteered geographic features in
   Chinese cities: Analyzing the associated local characteristics using
   geographically weighted regression}},
Journal = {{APPLIED GEOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{78}},
Pages = {{78-93}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The volunteered geographic information (VGI) gains increasing popularity
   with the general public and scientific community. However, the optimism
   about the VGI has been tempered by two critical issues: inequality in
   data coverage (social justice) and data quality. It therefore requires a
   better understanding of the mechanism driving VGI contributions and
   content quality. With a case of China, this paper demonstrates one
   potential avenue, examining the associations between VGI
   coverage/quality and local demographic and socioeconomic
   characteristics. In particular, VGI data are harvested from the
   OpenStreetMap for 333 cities in China. VGI coverage is measured by the
   total volume of different geographic features (point, line and polygon);
   and VGI quality is described from two aspects: completeness and
   accuracy. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) shows that both
   demographic and socioeconomic factors have statistically significant
   influences on VGI coverage and quality. More specifically, densely
   populous cities with more young, educated and non-agricultural people
   enjoy higher VGI coverage and quality. Cities with lower VGI coverage
   and quality are primarily located in the western and southwestern
   regions where the ethnic minorities concentrate. High VGI coverage and
   quality are possibly observed in economically developed cities with high
   marketization degree. Besides, possibility of high VGI coverage and
   quality occurs in cities with more labor in scientific research and
   greater percentage of employers in the tertiary industry. The GWR also
   demonstrates that the strength and nature of the obtained relationships
   vary across the 333 cities. The spatial non-stationary relationships may
   partially answer for the controversial empirical conclusions in earlier
   case studies at different scales. Quantitative analysis (Gini index,
   Lorenz curve and Moran's I index) further evidences the great inequality
   in VGI coverage and quality. It can be safely inferred that the
   differences in engagement and use of VGI, as a new digital divide, can
   raise troubling concerns on the social justice implications. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Using Artl@s as an example of a project that relies on volunteered
   geographic information (VGI), this article examines the specific
   challenges that exist, beyond those frequently discussed in general VGI
   systems (e.g., participants' motivation and data quality control) in
   regard to sharing research data in humanities: (1) most data from the
   humanities is qualitative and collected from multiple data sources which
   are often inconsistent and unmappable; (2) data is usually
   interconnected with multiple relationships among different tables which
   creates challenges for both mapping and query functionality; (3) data is
   both geographical and historical. Consequently addresses that no longer
   exist have to be geolocated and visualized on historical basemaps and
   spaces must be represented diachronically; (4) the design of web map
   application needs to balance both sophisticated research requirements
   and a user-friendly interface; (5) finally contributors expect their
   data to be cited or acknowledged when used in other studies and users
   need metadata and citation information in order to reuse and repurpose
   datasets.
   In this article, we discuss how Artl@s, a project which developed a
   georeferenced historical database of exhibition catalogues, addresses
   these challenges. Artl@s provides a case study for VGI adoption by
   digital humanities scholars for research data sharing, as it offers
   features, such as flexible batch data contribution, interrelated spatial
   query, automatic geolocalization of historical addresses, and data
   citation mechanisms.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH}},

Pages = {{675-686}},
Abstract = {{In this geo-statistical analysis of change detection, we illustrate the
   evolution of the built-up environment in Shanghai at the street-block
   level. Based on two TerraSAR-X image stacks with 36 and 15 images,
   covering the city centre of Shanghai for the time period from 2008 to
   2015, a set of coherence images was created using a small baseline
   approach. The road network from Open Street Map, a volunteered
   geographic information product, serves as the input dataset to create
   street-blocks. A street-block is surrounded by roads and resembles a
   ground parcel, a real estate property - a cadastral unit. The coherence
   information is aggregated to these street-blocks for each observation
   and the variation is analysed over time. An analysis of spatial
   autocorrelation reveals clusters of similar behaviours. The result is a
   detailed map of Shanghai highlighting areas of change. We argue that the
   aggregation and grouping of synthetic aperture radar coherence image
   information to real-world entities (street-blocks) is comprehensible and
   relevant to the urban planning process. Therefore, this research is a
   contribution to the community of urban planners, designers, and

Abstract = {{Geographic Information Systems (GIS) data are crucial for many
   applications such as disaster response, damage assessment, and recovery
   efforts. The 2010 Haiti earthquake destroyed buildings where GIS data
   were stored and many of the relief organizations ultimately depended on
   data retrieved from outside the country to do their work. The lesson
   learnt from this experience is that open access data is necessary in
   assisting tasks in such situations and therefore the evaluation of such
   data for its quality is important. This research evaluates OpenStreetMap
   (OSM) data that can be and is used by various organizations. The
   methodology followed is based on the International Organization for
   Standardization (ISO) Geographic Information-Quality Principles
   (ISO19113). According to the ISO19113 standard, the data quality
   elements are: completeness, logical consistency, positional accuracy,
   thematic accuracy, and temporal accuracy. The first four elements noted
   above were tested in this study. OSM data was compared with official
   data from Abu Dhabi city. Results show that the positional accuracy of
   OSM data meets the American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote
   Sensing (ASPRS) standards for 1: 20,000-scale maps. This indicates that
   OSM data could be used for many applications, taking into account the
   hurdles in GIS data acquisition, cost, availability, licensing,
   distribution policies, and documentation. The article concludes with a
   call for incorporation of geospatial data services and data quality
   initiatives in libraries.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental protection and in particular protected area management,

   especially challenging if protected areas bordering other countries. An
   approach providing information on administrative units across Europe in
   a standardised and hierarchical manner is the NUTS (Nomenclature of
   territorial units for statistics) and LAU (Local administrative units)
   system. However, the NUTS and LAU system generally only refers to
   attribute data providing administrative unit identifier codes and names.
   NUTS and LAU spatial data can not to be accessed so easy. Here, open
   data might be an alternative to purchased data. But, which possibilities
   exist to access open NUTS and LAU spatial data? Which challenges are
   related to the use of open data sources? This is illustrated by the
   example of the Balkan Green Belt as part of the European Green Belt.
   Examination of open data sources holding NUTS and LAU spatial data (e.g.
   EUROSTAT, national geoportals, Open Street Map, GADM) identified the

Abstract = {{Environmental pollution has significant impact on citizens' health and
   wellbeing in urban settings. While a variety of sensors have been
   integrated into today's urban environments for measuring various
   pollution factors such as air quality and noise, to set up sensor
   networks or employ surveyors to collect urban pollution datasets remains
   costly and may involve legal implications. An alternative approach is
   based on the notion of volunteered citizens as sensors for collecting,
   updating and disseminating urban environmental measurements using mobile
   devices. A Big Data scenario emerges as large-scale crowdsourcing
   activities tend to generate sizable and unstructured datasets with near
   real-time updates. Conventional computational infrastructures are
   inadequate for handling such Big Data, for example, designing a
   ``one-fits-all{''} database schema to accommodate diverse measurements,
   or dynamically generating pollution maps based on visual analytical
   workflows.
   This paper describes a CyberGIS-enabled urban sensing framework to
   facilitate the volunteered participation of citizens in sensing
   environmental pollutions using mobile devices. Since CyberGIS is based
   on advanced cyberinfrastructure and characterized as high performance,
   distributed, and collaborative GIS, the framework enables interactive
   visual analytics for big urban data. Specifically, this framework
   integrates a MongoDB cluster for data management (without requiring a
   predefined schema), a MapReduce approach to extracting and aggregating
   sensor measurements, and a scalable kernel smoothing algorithm using a
   graphics processing unit (GPU) for rapid pollution map generation. We
   demonstrate the functionality of this framework though a use case
   scenario of mapping noise levels, where an implemented mobile
   application is used for capturing geo-tagged and time-stamped noise
   level measurements as engaged users move around in urban settings.}},

Abstract = {{Twitter is a well-known microblogging platform for rapid diffusion of
   views, ideas, and information. During disasters, it has widely been used
   to communicate evacuation plans, distribute calls for help, and assist
   in damage assessment. The reliability of such information is very
   important for decision-making in a crisis situation, but also difficult
   to assess. There is little research so far on the transferability of
   quality assessment methods from one geographic region to another. The
   main contribution of this research is to study Twitter usage
   characteristics of users based in different geographic locations during
   disasters. We examine tweeting activity during two earthquakes in Italy
   and Myanmar. We compare the granularity of geographic references used,
   user profile characteristics that are related to credibility, and the
   performance of Naive Bayes models for classifying Tweets when used on
   data from a different region than the one used to train the model. Our
   results show similar geographic granularity for Myanmar and Italy
   earthquake events, but the Myanmar earthquake event has less information
   from locations nearby when compared to Italy. Additionally, there are
   significant and complex differences in user and usage characteristics,
   but a high performance for the Naive Bayes classifier even when applied
   to data from a different geographic region. This research provides a
   basis for further research in credibility assessment of users reporting

Volume = {{20}},

Pages = {{241-251}},
Abstract = {{In 2016, Niantic Labs released Pokemon Go, an augmented reality
   smartphone game that attracted millions of users worldwide. This game
   allows users to ``catch{''} Pokemons through their mobile cameras in
   different geographic locations that often correspond to prominent
   places. This paper analyzes the distribution of PokeStops, Pokemon gyms,
   and spawnpoints in selected urban areas of South Florida and Boston. It
   identifies which socioeconomic variables and land-use categories affect
   the density of PokeStops, and how PokeStops and gyms cluster relative to
   each other. Using nearest neighbor analysis, this paper assesses also
   how actual PokeStop locations are reflected in Yelp's ``PokeStop
   nearby{''} attribute. Results show that black and Hispanic neighborhoods
   are disadvantaged when it comes to crowd-sourced data coverage, that
   PokeStops occur more frequently in commercial, recreational and
   touristic sites and around universities, and that PokeStops tend to
   cluster around gyms. The latter suggests that these point sets were
   generated by a similar location selection process. To mitigate
   geographically linked biases, future versions of augmented reality and
   geo-games should aim to make them equally accessible in all areas, for
   example by placing extra resources, such as points of interest, in
   neighborhoods that are currently underrepresented in data coverage.}},

Journal = {{GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{252-268}},
Abstract = {{This paper extends recent research into the usefulness of volunteered
   photos for land cover extraction, and investigates whether this
   usefulness can be automatically assessed by an easily accessible,
   off-the-shelf neural network pre-trained on a variety of scene
   characteristics. Geotagged photographs are sometimes presented to
   volunteers as part of a game which requires them to extract relevant
   facts about land use. The challenge is to select the most relevant
   photographs in order to most efficiently extract the useful information
   while maintaining the engagement and interests of volunteers. By
   repurposing an existing network which had been trained on an extensive
   library of potentially relevant features, we can quickly carry out
   initial assessments of the general value of this approach, pick out
   especially salient features, and identify focus areas for future neural
   network training and development. We compare two approaches to extract
   land cover information from the network: a simple post hoc weighting
   approach accessible to non-technical audiences and a more complex
   decision tree approach that involves training on domain-specific
   features of interest. Both approaches had reasonable success in
   characterizing human influence within a scene when identifying the land
   use types (as classified by Urban Atlas) present within a buffer around
   the photograph's location. This work identifies important limitations
   and opportunities for using volunteered photographs as follows: (1) the
   false precision of a photograph's location is less useful for
   identifying on-the-spot land cover than the information it can give on
   neighbouring combinations of land cover; (2) ground-acquired
   photographs, interpreted by a neural network, can supplement plan view
   imagery by identifying features which will never be discernible from
   above; (3) when dealing with contexts where there are very few exemplars
   of particular classes, an independent a posteriori weighting of existing
   scene attributes and categories can buffer against over-specificity.}},

Journal = {{GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{20}},

Pages = {{269-281}},
Abstract = {{A land-use map at the regional scale is a heavy computation task yet is
   critical to most landowners, researchers, and decision-makers, enabling
   them to make informed decisions for varying objectives. There are two
   major difficulties in generating land classification maps at the
   regional scale: the necessity of large data-sets of training points and
   the expensive computation cost in terms of both money and time.
   Volunteered Geographic Information opens a new era in mapping and
   visualizing the physical world by providing an open-access database
   valuable georeferenced information collected by volunteer citizens. As
   one of the most well-known VGI initiatives, OpenStreetMap (OSM),
   contributes not only to road network distribution information but also
   to the potential for using these data to justify and delineate land
   patterns. Whereas, most large-scale mapping approaches - including
   regional and national scales - confuse ``land cover{''} and
   ``land-use{''}, or build up the land-use database based on modeled land
   cover data-sets, in this study, we clearly distinguished and
   differentiated land-use from land cover. By focusing on our prime
   objective of mapping land-use and management practices, a robust
   regional land-use mapping approach was developed by integrating OSM data
   with the earth observation remote sensing imagery. Our novel approach
   incorporates a vital temporal component to large-scale land-use mapping
   while effectively eliminating the typically burdensome computation and
   time/money demands of such work. Furthermore, our novel approach in
   regional scale land-use mapping produced robust results in our study
   area: the overall internal accuracy of the classifier was 95.2\% and the
   external accuracy of the classifier was measured at 74.8\%.}},

Abstract = {{The number of people registering in an online community depends on two
   main factors: interest in, and awareness of, the project. Registering to
   a project does not, however, imply contributing to it, as lacking the
   knowledge and skills can be a barrier to participation. In order to
   identify the nature of events that might have facilitated or hindered
   enrollments in the OpenStreetMap (OSM) project over time, we analyzed
   the correlations between the number of new participants and the events
   that dotted its history. Four different metrics were defined to
   characterize participants' behaviors: the daily number of registrations,
   the daily number of participants that made a first contribution, the
   delays between contributors' registration and their first edits, and a
   daily contribution ratio built from the number of new contributors and
   the number of new registered members. Time series analyses were used to
   identify trends, and outstanding variations of the number of
   participants. An inventory of events that took place along the OSM
   project's history was created and appreciable variations of the metrics
   have been linked to events that seemed to be meaningful. Although a
   correlation does not imply causality, many of the explanations these
   correlations suggest are supported by the results of other studies,
   either directly or indirectly. For instance, when considering the time
   participants spend as ``lurker{''}, as well as on the nature of the
   contribution of early participants. In other cases, they suggest new
   explanations for the origin of the spam accounts that affect
   registration statistics, or the decline in the proportion of registered

Abstract = {{Observations of living organisms by citizen scientists that are reported

   approaches for completeness estimation which were developed for data

   extrinsic approach, comparing species lists from citizen science data
   with National Park Service lists. Second, we examined two intrinsic
   approaches using total observation numbers in NPs and the development of
   the number of new species being added to the data-set over time. Results
   from the extrinsic approach provided appropriate completeness

Abstract = {{Provision of accurate air temperature data in urban environments with
   high spatial and temporal resolution over long time periods remains a
   challenge in atmospheric research. Crowdsourcing, i.e., collection of
   atmospheric data from non-traditional sources like citizen weather
   stations (CWS), is an alternative and cost-efficient method for
   exploration and monitoring of urban climates. This study examines the
   suitability of crowdsourced air temperature (T-crowd) measurements from
   CWS by comparing T-crowd from up to 1500 stations with reference air
   temperature (T-ref) in Berlin and surroundings for a period of twelve
   months (Jan-Dec 2015).
   Comprehensive quality assessment of T-crowd reveals that erroneous
   metadata, failure of data collection, and unsuitable exposure of sensors
   lead to a reduction of data availability by 53\%. Spatially aggregated
   raw data of T-crowd already provide a robust estimate of hourly and
   daily urban air temperature in the study area. Quality-checked T-crowd
   observations showspatio-temporal characteristics of the urban heat
   island in Berlin with higher spatial variability than T-ref in built-up
   areas. Spatial density of T-crowd in Berlin exceeds that of the
   reference monitoring network by far. However, rigorous data quality
   assessment is the key challenge in order to fully benefit from this
   novel data set for urban climate research. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Volunteered geographic information (VGI), OpenStreetMap (OSM), has been

   to unknown complex multivariate probability distributions. Then, the OSM
   data are assessed based on the theory that small probability samples
   contribute little to the autoencoder network and that they can be
   recognized by the higher reconstructed errors during training. In the
   method described here, the selected measures, including data
   completeness, positional accuracy, shape accuracy, semantic accuracy and
   orientation consistency between OSM and official data, are used as the

Abstract = {{Map databases traditionally capture snapshot representations of the

   specifically geometry-type definitions. The proposed measure can be (1)
   efficiently used to identify feature definition patterns reflecting
   community consensus that could be formalised in community guidelines and
   (2) deployed to identify regions that would benefit from increased
   editorial activity to achieve greater map homogeneity. We demonstrate
   the measure based on the content of the OpenStreetMap database in four

Abstract = {{In Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) projects, the tagging or

   Features, suggestions and guidance on what combinations of tags to use
   for certain geographic objects are outlined. In this paper, we consider
   these suggestions and recommendations and analyse the OSM database for
   40 cities around the world to ascertain if contributors to OSM in these
   urban areas are using this guidance in their tagging practices. Overall,
   we find that compliance with the suggestions and guidance in Map
   Features is generally average or poor. This leads us to conclude that
   contributors in these areas do not always tag features with the same

Abstract = {{Ever since behavioural geographers started working with place

   integral part of geographical research. Later, when Robert Chambers and
   others introduced maps into Participatory Rural Appraisal, Participatory
   GIS and Public Participation GIS were also recognized by quantitative
   geographers as research methods and visualization tools. In the era of
   smartphones and global Internet coverage, applications such as
   FixMyStreet, ArcGIS Online, CartoDB and Maptioannaire allow users to
   cross the technology gap and become neocartographers without the need
   for GIS knowledge. GeoParticipation based on using spatial tools in
   order to involve citizens in community participation can be the future
   development of Public Participation GIS as it provides an easy-to-use
   environment and social engagement while creating the feeling of
   belonging to a certain social group or community. The paper presents a
   historical review of participatory approaches to the creation of maps,
   while focusing on the changing role of citizens; from being the objects
   of geographical research to being the creators of the agenda as well as
   decision-makers within their communities. Maps were always used as tools

Abstract = {{Density is among the most important descriptive as well as normative
   measures in urban research. While its basic concept is generally
   understandable, approaches towards the density measure are manifold,
   diverse and of multidimensional complexity. This evolves from differing
   thematic, spatial and calculative specifications. Consequently, applied
   density measures are often used in a subjective, non-transparent,
   unspecific and thus non-comparable manner. In this paper, we aim at a
   systematic deconstruction of the measure density. Varying thematic,
   spatial and calculative dimensions show significant influence on the
   measure. With both quantitative and qualitative techniques of
   evaluation, we assess the particular influences on the measure density.
   To do so, we reduce our experiment setting to a mere physical
   perspective; that is, the quantitative measures building density, degree
   of soil sealing, floor space density and, more specifically, the density
   of generic structural classes such as open spaces and highest built-up
   density areas. Using up-to-date geodata derived from remote sensing and
   volunteered geographic information, we build upon high-quality spatial
   information products such as 3-D city models. Exemplified for the
   comparison of two European megacities, namely Paris and London, we
   reveal and systemize necessary variables to be clearly defined for
   meaningful conclusions using the density measure.}},

   development of tourism activities in rural areas. To assess the spatial
   distribution of rural tourism potential (RTP), a methodological approach
   was followed by combining the synergetic use of geographic information
   systems (GIS) and the analytical hierarchical process (AHP). For the
   evaluation model, six factors were examined and hierarchized by a panel
   of eighteen experts: tourism accommodation offer, activities in natural
   areas, gastronomic offer, cultural activities, bath offer in natural
   environments, and activities in active tourism. These factors were then
   decomposed into thirty-two evaluation criteria and the relative
   importance of their weights was estimated using pairwise judgments.
   Using publicly available data and volunteered geographic information
   (VGI) platforms, the related spatial and non-spatial data were
   collected, collated, and standardized, employing appropriate tools
   developed with open-source GIS software. The results, represented by a
   series of intensity maps, indicate the RTP scores, highlight the
   strengths and weaknesses in each county, and could serve as a planning
   tool for public and/or private investments.}},

Abstract = {{The increased ease for individuals to create, share and map geographic
   information combined with the need for timely, relevant and diverse
   information has resulted in a new disaster management context.
   Volunteered geographic information (VGI), or geographic information
   voluntarily created by private citizens enabled through technologies
   like social media and web-based mapping, has changed the ways people
   create and use information for crisis events. Research has focussed on
   disaster response while largely ignoring prevention and preparedness.
   Preparing for disasters can reduce negative impacts on life and
   property, but despite strategies to educate communities, preparation
   remains low. This study assesses the application and value of VGI in
   bushfire risk reduction through a participatory mapping approach. It
   examines VGI as a social practice and not simply a data source by
   considering the user experience of contributing VGI and the potential
   for these activities to increase community connectedness for building
   disaster resilience. Participatory mapping workshops were held in
   bushfire-risk communities in Tasmania. Workshop activities included a
   paper-mapping exercise and web-based digital mapping. Survey results
   from 31 participants at three workshops indicated the process of mapping
   and contributing local information for bushfire preparation with other
   community members can contribute to increased social connectedness,
   understanding of local bushfire risk, and engagement in risk reduction.
   Local knowledge exchange was seen as valuable, but the social dimension
   appeared even more engaging than the specific information shared.
   Participants reported collaborative maps as effective for collating and
   sharing community bushfire information with a preference for digital
   mapping. Some limitations of online sharing of information were also
   reported by participants, however, including potential issues of
   privacy, data quality and source trustworthiness. Further work is needed
   to extrapolate findings from the study sample to the broader population.

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A protocol for the collection of vector data in Volunteered Geographic
   Information (VGI) projects is proposed. VGI is a source of crowdsourced
   geographic data and information which is comparable, and in some cases
   better, than equivalent data from National Mapping Agencies (NMAs) and
   Commercial Surveying Companies (CSC). However, there are many
   differences in how NMAs and CSC collect, analyse, manage and distribute
   geographic information to that of VGI projects. NMAs and CSC make use of
   robust and standardised data collection protocols whilst VGI projects
   often provide guidelines rather than rigorous data collection
   specifications. The proposed protocol addresses formalising the
   collection and creation of vector data in VGI projects in three
   principal ways: by manual vectorisation; field survey; and reuse of
   existing data sources. This protocol is intended to be generic rather
   than being linked to any specific VGI project. We believe that this is
   the first protocol for VGI vector data collection that has been formally
   described in the literature. Consequently, this paper shall serve as a
   starting point for on-going development and refinement of the protocol.}},

Abstract = {{Citizens are increasingly becoming involved in data collection, whether
   for scientific purposes, to carry out micro-tasks, or as part of a
   gamified, competitive application. In some cases, volunteered data
   collection overlaps with that of mapping agencies, e.g., the
   citizen-based mapping of features in OpenStreetMap. LUCAS (Land Use
   Cover Area frame Sample) is one source of authoritative in-situ data
   that are collected every three years across EU member countries by
   trained personnel at a considerable cost to taxpayers. This paper
   presents a mobile application called FotoQuest Austria, which involves
   citizens in the crowdsourcing of in-situ land cover and land use data,
   including at locations of LUCAS sample points in Austria. The results
   from a campaign run during the summer of 2015 suggest that land cover
   and land use can be crowdsourced using a simple protocol based on LUCAS.
   This has implications for remote sensing as this data stream represents
   a new source of potentially valuable information for the training and
   validation of land cover maps as well as for area estimation purposes.
   Although the most detailed and challenging classes were more difficult
   for untrained citizens to recognize, the agreement between the
   crowdsourced data and the LUCAS data for basic high level land cover and
   land use classes in homogeneous areas (ca. 80\%) shows clear potential.
   Recommendations for how to further improve the quality of the
   crowdsourced data in the context of LUCAS are provided so that this
   source of data might one day be accurate enough for land cover mapping
   purposes.}},

Volume = {{56}},
Pages = {{81-89}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Land administration systems assist citizens in identifying their rights,
   restrictions and responsibilities (RRRs) associated with land and
   property. However, delineating the spatial extent of all RRRs regulated
   in legislation remains a challenge. Approaches that have been used so
   far are mainly based on accurate surveying processes, which are untimely
   and too expensive. Previous studies proposed Volunteered Geographical
   Information (VGI) as a practical and low-cost method for fast
   acquisition of spatial data from volunteered contributions, mostly for
   countries where a limited number of land rights records exist. However,
   VGI could be beneficial for advanced and developing land administration
   systems in terms of collecting a range of RRRs which are not spatially
   well recorded and represented. A multidisciplinary review of the
   literature on VGI and land administration reveals the lack of a
   comprehensive conceptual framework for utilising VGI in land
   administration for the purpose of collecting a range of RRRs related to
   land and property. This paper investigates the main aspects of utilising
   VGI in land administration based on qualitative content analysis of
   available resources. The outcome of this research suggests that using
   VGI in land administration requires a comprehensive understanding of the
   complexities and interconnections of legal, institutional, technical and
   social aspects within each jurisdiction. These findings are merged to
   formulate a generic and innovative conceptual framework which serves as
   a basis for the process of collecting land and property RRRs from
   volunteer contributions. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Neogeography is the name given to the phenomenon of the vastly expanded
   Geographic Information Systems (GIS) user base. It consists of a
   collection of practices, tools and users generally found outside of
   traditional, authoritative GIS. GIS are computer applications that allow
   users to contribute geotagged data and to access and utilize geospatial
   data sets in combination with attribute information for a variety of
   purposes. This paper investigates questions of whether neogeography
   furthers the democratization of GIS and if increased access translates
   to empowerment or, conversely, to further marginalization. The research
   is interpretative and involves a literature review of the topic and a
   metasynthesis of recent qualitative research. Metasynthesis involves
   critical evaluation of data to identify an appropriate research sample
   and synthesis of findings by a compare-and-contrast exercise followed by
   reciprocal translation of each study into the other studies to reveal
   overarching metaphors. This is followed by conclusions and
   recommendations. The findings show that, depending on circumstances,
   neogeography can result in the democratization of GIS and geospatial
   data but may also constitute new methods of exclusion depending on
   technological and societal barriers. Neogeography can also result in
   empowerment, but this is difficult to define and is often highly
   contingent on local context.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the high cost of traditional forest plot measurements, the
   availability of up-to-date in situ forest inventory data has been a
   bottleneck for remote sensing image analysis in support of the important
   global forest biomass mapping. Capitalizing on the proliferation of
   smartphones, citizen science is a promising approach to increase spatial
   and temporal coverages of in situ forest observations in a
   cost-effective way. Digital cameras can be used as a relascope device to
   measure basal area, a forest density variable that is closely related to
   biomass. In this paper, we present the Relasphone mobile application
   with extensive accuracy assessment in two mixed forest sites from
   different biomes. Basal area measurements in Finland ( boreal zone) were
   in good agreement with reference forest inventory plot data on pine (
   R-2 = 0.75, RMSE = 5.33 m(2)/ha), spruce ( R-2 = 0.75, RMSE = 6.73

   RMSE = 32.46 m(3)/ha) and total stem volume ( R-2 = 0.87, RMSE = 35.21

   reference data in combination with optical satellite images to produce

Abstract = {{In the past two decades Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) established
   itself as an efficient approach for the classification and extraction of
   information from remote sensing imagery and, increasingly, from
   non-image based sources such as Airborne Laser Scanner (ALS) point
   clouds. ALS data is represented in the form of a point cloud with
   recorded multiple returns and intensities. In our work, we combined OBIA
   with ALS point cloud data in order to identify and extract buildings as
   2D polygons representing roof outlines in a top down mapping approach.
   We performed rasterization of the ALS data into a height raster for the
   purpose of the generation of a Digital Surface Model (DSM) and a derived
   Digital Elevation Model (DEM). Further objects were generated in
   conjunction with point statistics from the linked point cloud. With the
   use of class modelling methods, we generated the final target class of
   objects representing buildings. The approach was developed for a test
   area in Biberach an der Riss (Germany). In order to point out the
   possibilities of the adaptation-free transferability to another data
   set, the algorithm has been applied ``as is{''} to the ISPRS
   Benchmarking data set of Toronto (Canada). The obtained results show
   high accuracies for the initial study area (thematic accuracies of
   around 98\%, geometric accuracy of above 80\%). The very high

Abstract = {{In the past few years, volunteers have produced geographic information
   of different kinds, using a variety of different crowdsourcing
   platforms, within a broad range of contexts. However, there is still a
   lack of clarity about the specific types of tasks that volunteers can
   perform for deriving geographic information from remotely sensed
   imagery, and how the quality of the produced information can be assessed
   for particular task types. To fill this gap, we analyse the existing
   literature and propose a typology of tasks in geographic information
   crowdsourcing, which distinguishes between classification, digitisation
   and conflation tasks. We then present a case study related to the
   ``Missing Maps{''} project aimed at crowdsourced classification to
   support humanitarian aid. We use our typology to distinguish between the
   different types of crowdsourced tasks in the project and choose
   classification tasks related to identifying roads and settlements for an
   evaluation of the crowdsourced classification. This evaluation shows
   that the volunteers achieved a satisfactory overall performance
   (accuracy: 89\%; sensitivity: 73\%; and precision: 89\%). We also
   analyse different factors that could influence the performance,
   concluding that volunteers were more likely to incorrectly classify
   tasks with small objects. Furthermore, agreement among volunteers was
   shown to be a very good predictor of the reliability of crowdsourced
   classification: tasks with the highest agreement level were 41 times
   more probable to be correctly classified by volunteers. The results thus
   show that the crowdsourced classification of remotely sensed imagery is
   able to generate geographic information about human settlements with a
   high level of quality. This study also makes clear the different
   sophistication levels of tasks that can be performed by volunteers and
   reveals some factors that may have an impact on their performance.}},

   many spatial processes. If this concept applies to volunteered
   geographic information (VGI), it could help to efficiently allocate
   tasks in citizen science campaigns and help to improve the overall
   quality of collected data. In this paper, we use classifications of
   satellite imagery by volunteers from around the world to test whether
   local familiarity with landscapes helps their performance. Our results
   show that volunteers identify cropland slightly better within their home
   country, and do slightly worse as a function of linear distance between
   their home and the location represented in an image. Volunteers with a
   professional background in remote sensing or land cover did no better
   than the general population at this task, but they did not show the
   decline with distance that was seen among other participants. Even in a
   landscape where pasture is easily confused for cropland, regional
   residents demonstrated no advantage. Where we did find evidence for
   local knowledge aiding classification performance, the realized impact
   of this effect was tiny. Rather, the inherent difficulty of a task is a
   much more important predictor of volunteer performance. These findings
   suggest that, at least for simple tasks, the geographical origin of VGI
   volunteers has little impact on their ability to complete image
   classifications.}},

Abstract = {{(1) Background: Due to the advent of Volunteered Geographic Information
   (VGI), large datasets of user-generated Points of Interest (POI) are now
   available. As with all VGI, however, there is uncertainty concerning
   data quality and fitness-for-use. Currently, the task of evaluating
   fitness-for-use of POI is left to the data user, with no guidance
   framework being available which is why this research proposes a generic
   approach to choose appropriate measures for assessing fitness-for-use of
   crowdsourced POI for different tasks. (2) Methods: POI are related to
   the higher-level concept of geo-atoms in order to identify and
   distinguish their two basic functions, geo-referencing and
   object-referencing. Then, for each of these functions, suitable measures
   of positional and thematic quality are developed based on existing
   quality indicators. (3) Results: Typical use cases of POI are evaluated
   with regards to their use of the two basic functions of POI, and
   allocated appropriate measures for fitness-for-use. The general
   procedure is illustrated on a brief practical example. (4) Conclusion:
   This research addresses the issue of fitness-for-use of POI on a higher
   conceptual level by relating it to more fundamental notions of
   geographical information representation. The results are expected to
   assist users of crowdsourced POI datasets in determining an appropriate
   method to evaluate fitness-for-use.}},

Abstract = {{Online social media crowdsourced photos contain a vast amount of visual
   information about the physical properties and characteristics of the
   earth's surface. Flickr is an important online social media platform for
   users seeking this information. Each day, users generate crowdsourced
   geotagged digital imagery containing an immense amount of information.
   In this paper, geotagged Flickr images are used for automatic extraction
   of low-level land use/land cover (LULC) features. The proposed method
   uses a naive Bayes classifier with color, shape, and color index
   descriptors. The classified images are mapped using a majority filtering
   approach. The classifier performance in overall accuracy, kappa
   coefficient, precision, recall, and f-measure was 87.94\%, 82.89\%,
   88.20\%, 87.90\%, and 88\%, respectively. Labeled-crowdsourced images
   were filtered into a spatial tile of a 30 m x 30 m resolution using the
   majority voting method to reduce geolocation uncertainty from the
   crowdsourced data. These tile datasets were used as training and
   validation samples to classify Landsat TM5 images. The supervised
   maximum likelihood method was used for the LULC classification. The
   results show that the geotagged Flickr images can classify LULC types
   with reasonable accuracy and that the proposed approach improves LULC
   classification efficiency if a sufficient spatial distribution of
   crowdsourced data exists.}},

Abstract = {{The emergence of Web 2.0, open source software tools, and geosocial
   networks, along with associated mobile devices and available government
   data, is widely considered to have altered the nature and processes of
   place-based digital participation. Considerable theorizing has been
   dedicated to the geographic version of Web 2.0, the geospatial Web
   (Geoweb). To assess the theories, we draw on four years of empirical
   work across Canada that considers the nature of public participation on
   the Geoweb. We are driven by the question of how easy or difficult it is
   to do Geoweb-enabled participation, particularly participation as
   envisioned by researchers such as Arnstein and planning practitioners.
   We consider how the Geoweb could transform methods by which citizens and
   nonprofit organizations communicate with the state on environmental
   issues that affect their lives. We conduct a meta-analysis of twelve
   research cases and derive new findings that reach across the cases on
   how the Geoweb obliges us to redefine and unitize participation. This
   redefinition reifies existing digital inequalities, blurs distinctions
   between experts and nonexperts, heterogenizes the state as an actor in
   the participation process, reassigns participation activities in a
   participation hierarchy, and distances participation from channels of
   influence.}},

   the pioneering field of disaster management but the described approach
   and the developed classification schema are easily adaptable to

   that a hypothesized consolidation of research, characterized through the
   building of canonical bodies of knowledge and advanced application cases

   studies investigate the challenges and potential solutions of data
   handling, with fewer studies focusing on socio-technological issues or
   advanced applications. This trend is currently showing no sign of
   change, highlighting that VGI research is still very much
   technology-driven as opposed to theory- or application-driven. From the
   results of the systematic mapping study, the authors formulate and
   discuss several research objectives for future work, which could lead to
   a stronger, more theory-driven treatment of the topic VGI in GIScience.

Abstract = {{In recent decades, greenways have been the focus of an international
   movement to improve urban environment quality. In metropolitan areas,
   more greenways are interconnected, forming a greenway network (GN). A GN
   is considered to encourage physical activities, but verifying this
   statement is difficult, as traditional social survey methods do not
   obtain fine-grain activity geographic data on a large scale. In view of
   this shortcoming, the volunteered geographic information and the
   geographic information system techniques were used to describe the
   distribution of physical activities in a GN, to explore the effects of
   greenway network features on supporting activities. The 1640-km-long
   Shenzhen GN was selected as a representative case, and walking, jogging
   and cycling were chosen as typical activities. The results showed that
   only a quarter of greenways were with activities. Greenways with dense
   residences, mixed land-use, advanced street network and large parks
   yielded positive effects on supporting physical activities, and advanced
   public transportation further improved activity diversity. Due to the
   spatial mismatch between the GN distribution and well-developed areas,
   the GN density showed negative effects on the presence of physical
   activities; within the greenways in use, the GN density, significantly
   improved activity diversity, indicating the positive effect of network
   feature on supporting activities. Compared with neighbourhood greenways,
   city and regional greenways supported more physical activities due to
   richer natural resources. The findings reveal that GN in green and
   welldeveloped areas supports physical activities better. Location, green
   quality and network form are necessary for greenways and should be
   integrated into GN planning. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 26}},
Abstract = {{Volunteered geographical information (VGI) and citizen science have
   become important sources data for much scientific research. In the
   domain of land cover, crowdsourcing can provide a high temporal
   resolution data to support different analyses of landscape processes.
   However, the scientists may have little control over what gets recorded
   by the crowd, providing a potential source of error and uncertainty.
   This study compared analyses of crowdsourced land cover data that were
   contributed by different groups, based on nationality (labelled Gondor
   and Non-Gondor) and on domain experience (labelled Expert and
   Non-Expert). The analyses used a geographically weighted model to
   generate maps of land cover and compared the maps generated by the
   different groups. The results highlight the differences between the maps
   how specific land cover classes were under-and over-estimated. As
   crowdsourced data and citizen science are increasingly used to replace
   data collected under the designed experiment, this paper highlights the
   importance of considering between group variations and their impacts on
   the results of analyses. Critically, differences in the way that
   landscape features are conceptualised by different groups of
   contributors need to be considered when using crowdsourced data in
   formal scientific analyses. The discussion considers the potential for
   variation in crowdsourced data, the relativist nature of land cover and
   suggests a number of areas for future research. The key finding is that
   the veracity of citizen science data is not the critical issue per se.
   Rather, it is important to consider the impacts of differences in the
   semantics, affordances and functions associated with landscape features
   held by different groups of crowdsourced data contributors.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this research was to develop a model for validating

   this, a Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) dataset was used, the

   was collected using the pen-and-paper method while the traffic accident
   locations were determined using Global Positioning System (GPS)
   receivers embedded within police vehicles. This form of data entry
   invariably introduces errors in both geometric and contextual
   attributes. To fully counteract these errors, the developed model
   consists of two key concepts: the jaro-Winkler string matching technique
   and the Inverse Distance Weighting method. Over 66\% of traffic accident
   locations were validated, which is an increase of 15\% when compared to

Abstract = {{This article sets forth the early phases of a methodological proposal
   for designing and developing Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI)
   initiatives based on a system perspective analysis in which the
   components depend and interact dynamically among each other. First, it
   focuses on those characteristics of VGI projects that present different
   goals and modes of organization, while using a crowdsourcing strategy to
   manage participants and contributions. Next, a tool is developed in
   order to design the central crowdsourced processing unit that is best
   suited for a specific project definition, associating it with a trend
   towards crowd-based or community-driven approaches. The design is
   structured around the characterization of different ways of
   participating, and the task cognitive demand of working on
   geo-information management, spatial problem solving and ideation, or
   knowledge acquisition. Then, the crowdsourcing process design helps to
   identify what kind of participants are needed and outline subsequent
   engagement strategies. This is based on an analysis of differences among
   volunteers' participatory behaviors and the associated set of factors
   motivating them to contribute, whether on a crowd or community-sourced
   basis. From a VGI system perspective, this paper presents a set of
   guidelines and methodological steps in order to align project goals,
   processes and volunteers and thus successfully attract participation.
   This methodology helps establish the initial requirements for a VGI

Title = {{Guided Classification System for Conceptual Overlapping Classes in
   OpenStreetMap}},
Journal = {{ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION}},
Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The increased development of Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI)
   and its potential role in GIScience studies raises questions about the
   resulting data quality. Several studies address VGI quality from various
   perspectives like completeness, positional accuracy, consistency, etc.
   They mostly have consensus on the heterogeneity of data quality. The
   problem may be due to the lack of standard procedures for data
   collection and absence of quality control feedback for voluntary
   participants. In our research, we are concerned with data quality from
   the classification perspective. Particularly in VGI-mapping projects,
   the limited expertise of participants and the non-strict definition of
   geographic features lead to conceptual overlapping classes, where an
   entity could plausibly belong to multiple classes, e.g., lake or pond,
   park or garden, marsh or swamp, etc. Usually, quantitative and/or
   qualitative characteristics exist that distinguish between classes.
   Nevertheless, these characteristics might not be recognizable for
   non-expert participants. In previous work, we developed the rule-guided
   classification approach that guides participants to the most appropriate
   classes. As exemplification, we tackle the conceptual overlapping of
   some grass-related classes. For a given data set, our approach presents
   the most highly recommended classes for each entity. In this paper, we
   present the validation of our approach. We implement a web-based
   application called Grass\&Green that presents recommendations for
   crowdsourcing validation. The findings show the applicability of the
   proposed approach. In four months, the application attracted 212
   participants from more than 35 countries who checked 2,865 entities. The
   results indicate that 89\% of the contributions fully/partially agree
   with our recommendations. We then carried out a detailed analysis that
   demonstrates the potential of this enhanced data classification. This
   research encourages the development of customized applications that
   target a particular geographic feature.}},

Abstract = {{OpenStreetMap (OSM) thrives on allowing anyone in the world to
   contribute features to a free online geographical database, thereby
   allowing international mixes of contributors to create the map in any
   given place. Using South America as a test area, I explore the geography
   of OSM contributors by applying automated language identification to the
   free-form comments that contributors make when saving their work. By
   cross-referencing these languages with users' self-reported hometowns
   from their profiles, I evaluate the effectiveness of language detection
   as a method for inferring the percentage of local contributors versus
   the percentage of ``armchair mappers{''} from elsewhere. I show that
   most English-speaking contributors to the South American OSM are from
   outside the continent (rather than multilingual locals). The percentage
   of English use is higher in poor areas and rural areas, suggesting that
   residents of these places exercise less control over their map contents.
   Finally, I demonstrate that some features related to daily needs of
   health, education, and transportation are mapped with higher priority by
   contributors who speak the local language. These findings give

Abstract = {{Currently, the best practice to support land planning calls for the
   development of Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDI) capable of integrating
   both geospatial datasets and time series information from multiple

   potentially distributed in several nodes on the Internet to support
   scalability, of products derived by processing remote sensing images,
   authoritative data, georeferenced in-situ measurements and voluntary
   information (VGI) created by farmers and agronomists using an original

Abstract = {{Automatic extraction of objects in urban areas from very-high-resolution
   (VHR) images is of great significance to many applications. Existing
   approaches consider little information on spatial relationships,
   backgrounds, and prior knowledge of target objects, leading to that they
   did not perform well in object extraction. Now free and fast growing
   volunteered geographic information (VGI) can be accessed easily; thus,
   they can be used as prior information to improve the performance. This
   study develops an extended random walker (RW) approach to form a
   bottom-up and top-down mechanism for extracting target objects by
   combining VHR images and VGI data. Novel aspects of our approach
   include: 1) both the shape and spectral prior terms are incorporated
   into the extended RW algorithm; 2) an end-to-end framework is proposed
   to automatically select both foreground and background seeds with the
   assistance of VGI data; and 3) the shape prior of VGI data provides
   top-down information to select background and foreground seeds and help
   fuse bottom-up image information (i.e., foreground and background seeds
   and spatial relationships) to extract target objects. The extended RW
   approach was validated on building and lake datasets, and its
   performance is evaluated on both pixel and object levels. Quantitative
   comparisons with the original RW and random forest (RF) algorithm
   indicate that the proposed approach achieves significant better
   performance. Besides, it can successfully extract the partly occluded
   buildings.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{57}},
Pages = {{189-198}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Volunteered geographic information (VGI) refers to the widespread
   creation and sharing of geographic information by private citizens,
   often through platforms such as online mapping tools, social media, and
   smartphone applications. VGI has shifted the ways information is
   created, shared, used and experienced, with important implications for
   applications of geospatial data, including emergency management.
   Detailed interviews with 13 emergency management professionals from
   eight organisations across five Australian states provided insights into
   the impacts of VGI on official emergency management. Perceived
   opportunities presented by VGI included improved communication,
   acquisition of diverse local information, and increased community
   engagement in disaster management. Identified challenges included the
   digital divide, data management, misinformation, and liability concerns.
   Significantly, VGI disrupts the traditional top-down structure of
   emergency management and reflects a culture shift away from
   authoritative control of information. To capitalise on the opportunities
   of VGI, agencies need to share responsibility and be willing to remain
   flexible in supporting positive community practises, including VGI.
   Given the high accountability and inherently responsive nature of
   decision making in disaster management, it provides a useful lens
   through which to examine the impacts of VGI on official authoritative
   systems more broadly. This analysis of the perceptions of emergency
   management professionals suggests changes to traditional systems that
   involve decentralisation of power and increased empowerment of citizens,
   where value is increasingly recognised in both expert and
   citizen-produced information, initiatives and practises. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Citizens are increasingly becoming an important source of geographic
   information, sometimes entering domains that had until recently been the
   exclusive realm of authoritative agencies. This activity has a very
   diverse character as it can, amongst other things, be active or passive,
   involve spatial or aspatial data and the data provided can be variable
   in terms of key attributes such as format, description and quality.
   Unsurprisingly, therefore, there are a variety of terms used to describe
   data arising from citizens. In this article, the expressions used to
   describe citizen sensing of geographic information are reviewed and
   their use over time explored, prior to categorizing them and
   highlighting key issues in the current state of the subject. The latter
   involved a review of similar to 100 Internet sites with particular focus
   on their thematic topic, the nature of the data and issues such as
   incentives for contributors. This review suggests that most sites
   involve active rather than passive contribution, with citizens typically
   motivated by the desire to aid a worthy cause, often receiving little

Abstract = {{Accurate maps of surface water are essential for many environmental
   applications. Surface water maps can be generated by combining
   measurements from multiple sources. Precise estimation of surface water
   using satellite imagery remains a challenging task due to the sensor
   limitations, complex land cover, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
   As a complementary dataset, in the case of hilly landscapes, a drainage
   network can be extracted from high-resolution digital elevation models.
   Additionally, Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) initiatives, such
   as OpenStreetMap, can also be used to produce high-resolution surface
   water masks. In this study, we derive a high-resolution water mask using
   Landsat 8 imagery and OpenStreetMap as well as (potential) a drainage
   network using 30 m SRTM. Our approach to derive a surface water mask
   from Landsat 8 imagery comprises the use of a lower 15\% percentile of
   Landsat 8 Top of Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance from 2013 to 2015. We
   introduce a new non-parametric unsupervised method based on the Canny
   edge filter and Otsu thresholding to detect water in flat areas. For
   hilly areas, the method is extended with an additional supervised
   classification step used to refine the water mask. We applied the method
   across the Murray-Darling basin, Australia. Differences between our new
   Landsat-based water mask and the OpenStreetMap water mask regarding
   positional differences along the rivers and overall coverage were
   analyzed. Our results show that about 50\% of the OpenStreetMap linear
   water features can be confirmed using the water mask extracted from
   Landsat 8 imagery and the drainage network derived from SRTM. We also
   show that the observed distances between river features derived from
   OpenStreetMap and Landsat 8 are mostly smaller than 60 m. The
   differences between the new water mask and SRTM-based linear features
   and hilly areas are slightly larger (110 m). The overall agreement
   between OpenStreetMap and Landsat 8 water masks is about 30\%.}},

Abstract = {{OpenStreetMap (OSM) is an online public access database that allows for
   the collaborative collection of local geographic information. We employ
   this mapping technology to discuss a new social theory of poverty that
   moves away from income poverty to an economy that directly produces
   individuals' basic needs. Focusing on urban farming in Philadelphia as
   an example, we use OSM to support the argument that money, land, labor,
   and capital do not limit food production in the city. OSM is a type of
   commons that allows community members to depict features of interest to
   them that might otherwise be underrepresented in official or
   commercially produced maps such as Google Maps. Using the concept of
   facilitated volunteered geographic information (VGI) we developed an
   open framework for combining residents' local knowledge of food
   resources with expert guidance in data input. We believe this helps
   overcome problems with ad hoc data submission efforts to which
   collaborative online projects are susceptible. The program for tagging
   food resources in OSM was deployed in a public map-a-thon event we
   organized in Philadelphia, bringing together technical experts and food
   enthusiasts. To share the results, we present the Philly Fresh Food Map
   as an interactive online Web map that can be used and updated by the

   Empleamos esta tecnologia cartografica para discutir una nueva teoria
   social de la pobreza, que se desplaza desde aquella que define la
   pobreza por el ingreso, hacia una economia que directamente produce las
   necesidades basicas del individuo. Si nos enfocamos en la agricultura
   urbana de Filadelfia, como ejemplo, usamos el OSM en apoyo del argumento
   de que el dinero, la tierra, el trabajo y el capital no limitan la

   conocimiento local de recursos del alimento de los residentes con la
   guia de un experto en entrada de datos. Creemos que esto ayuda a vencer
   los problemas relacionados con los esfuerzos de remitir datos ad hoc a
   los cuales los proyectos urbanos colaborativos son susceptibles. El
   programa para etiquetar los recursos alimentarios en OSM fue desplegado
