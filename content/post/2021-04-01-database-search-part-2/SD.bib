abstract = {Cultural ecosystem services (CES) are some of the most valuable contributions of ecosystems to human well-being. Nevertheless, these services are often underrepresented in ecosystem service assessments. Defining CES for the purposes of spatial quantification has been challenging because it has been difficult to spatially model CES. However, rapid increases in mobile network connectivity and the use of social media have generated huge amounts of crowdsourced data. This offers an opportunity to define and spatially quantify CES. We inventoried established CES conceptualisations and sources of crowdsourced data to propose a CES definition and typology for spatial quantification. Furthermore, we present the results of three spatial models employing crowdsourced data to measure CES on Texel, a coastal island in the Netherlands. Defining CES as information-flows best enables service quantification. A general typology of eight services is proposed. The spatial models produced distributions consistent with known areas of cultural importance on Texel. However, user representativeness and measurement uncertainties affect our results. Ethical considerations must also be taken into account. Still, crowdsourced data is a valuable source of information to define and model CES due to the level of detail available. This can encourage the representation of CES in ecosystem service assessments.}

In this study, we aimed to develop an effective method to assess the credibility of VGI for time-critical conditions, such as disaster response. We collected datasets from two extreme flood events in 2011 and 2013 from Brisbane, Australia. According to the defined geo-location factors, we built a binary logistic regression with the 2011 event dataset to measure the credibility scores of the VGI instances. At the threshold of 0.917, the overall accuracy of the model in the 2011 training dataset was 90.5%. Next, the performance of this probability model was evaluated by the 2013 testing instances. We found that our model could categorize the credibility classes with 80.4% accuracy. These results suggest great potential for our model to be used by emergency management sectors to sort credibility of VGI for efficient and rapid response, decision-making, and coordination.}

These contributions may be qualitative or quantitative observations and include multimedia content such as videos and photos. With this new data source, new spatial patterns maybe revealed that previously went unnoticed. Specific issues associated to VGI that are particularly interesting to human geographers relate to volunteer's motivation, accuracy, precision, and reliability of the data, questions about whether the data are contributed by a local expert or a remote user, ethical considerations related to data ownership and views that may be privileged over others on new maps generated with VGI.}

As socially constructed data, health VGI reflect the people who perceive issues and choose to report them, and the digital systems that structure the reporting process. We propose a conceptual framework that describes the interlocking effects of socioeconomic, behavioral, geographic, and technological processes on VGI accuracy and credibility. GIS and statistical methods are used to analyze social and geographical biases in health-related VGI through a case study of bed bug complaint data from New York City's 311 system. Reports of bed bug infestation from 311 are mapped and modeled to uncover associations with socioeconomic and built environment characteristics. Factors associated with bed bug report credibility are examined by comparing characteristics of confirmed reports with those for reports in which inspectors found no evidence of infestation (negative reports). A multilevel model of credibility incorporating report-, building-, and tract-level variables reveals strong geographical and socioeconomic biases, with negative reports generated more frequently from high-value residential buildings located in high-income neighborhoods with predominately white, non-Hispanic populations. Using 311 data for all bed bug reports, rather than confirmed reports, obscures the burden of these pests in high poverty neighborhoods and diminishes socioeconomic disparities. Mistaken reporting also has economic costs, as each report triggers an inspection by city inspectors that entails time, monetary, and opportunity costs.}

However, newly available data sources promise extended possibilities for the investigation and understanding of the underlying factors. We validate the rationale for using both opportunistically available crowd-sourced data (i.e., volunteered geographic information or VGI) as well as more established but rarely investigated authoritative data as predictors of subjective cycling risk. We achieve this by correlating indicators of cycling risk extracted from both VGI and authoritative data for two different German cities with participants’ risk estimates assessed in laboratory-based virtual reality experiments. In Case 1, 15 participants (mostly undergraduate students with a mean age of 22 years old; nine of them females) were tested as a sample representing frequent and experienced cyclists, but unfamiliar with the 19 tested locations and less likely to be affected by the virtual reality setup. In Case 2, 24 new participants (mostly undergraduate students; mean age 24 years; 13 of them females) were experienced cyclists and mostly familiar with the 40 test locations located in their city of residence. For both cases, our findings provide evidence that parameters extracted from VGI (e.g., the semantic severity of the contribution and the reception by other citizens) as well as from authoritative data sources (e.g., accident statistics or Space Syntax measures) represent valid indicators for the subjectively perceived risk of cycling at a specific location. On the basis of this validation, future research can use these data sources to investigate the sources of risk perception during urban cycling in greater detail.}

Such an approach has significant advantages but requires access to relatively detailed spatial data. In the absence of official data concerning resources, researchers may benefit from employing increasingly available volunteered geographic information (VGI) as a central source of data or to complement more traditional data sources. This paper describes the development of a map of forest recreational resources in Ireland by combining conventional forest cover data and VGI of recreational trails. As an extension the new map is combined with household survey data to explore respondent's ability to identify local recreational forests and models the impact of the characteristics of the closest forest on their annual visitation. The results suggest that VGI can be a useful resource to researchers in both the identification and characterisation of recreational resources. In addition, this paper finds that the distance to and characteristics of the nearest recreational forest has a significant impact on total annual visitation by members of the public.}

Recently researchers’ attention has focused on using crowds of volunteers to help map the damaged infrastructure and devastation caused by natural disasters, such as those in Haiti and Pakistan. This data is extremely useful, as it is allows us to assess damage and thus aid the distribution of relief, but it tells us little about how the people in such areas will react to the devastation. This paper demonstrates a prototype spatially explicit agent-based model, created using crowdsourced geographic information and other sources of publicly available data, which can be used to study the aftermath of a catastrophic event. The specific case modelled here is the Haiti earthquake of January 2010. Crowdsourced data is used to build the initial populations of people affected by the event, to construct their environment, and to set their needs based on the damage to buildings. We explore how people react to the distribution of aid, as well as how rumours relating to aid availability propagate through the population. Such a model could potentially provide a link between socio-cultural information about the people affected and the relevant humanitarian relief organizations.}

Background is provided that traces the development of the use of geographic information in intelligence gathering and use, introducing the founding of the US National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and its adoption of GEOINT as a key form of intelligence. This strategy transformed the nature of how geospatial technologies were adopted and integrated to provide actionable intelligence to decision makers. As the transition to GEOINT became complete, demands on intelligence changed due to asymmetric warfare, leading to a movement toward the human terrain program and later, the adoption of human geography as an emphasis to understanding complex cultural contexts, such as insurgencies. Most recently, GEOINT has included university collaborations, certification programs, and the emergence of a United States Geospatial Intelligence Foundation. GEOINT is again transforming itself in an era of cyberwarfare, volunteered geographic information, and global climate change and its consequences for both security and new technologies and threats.}

Our objective was to validate Safecast data by comparing Safecast data with authoritative data collected by the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the U. S.

VGI has shifted the ways information is created, shared, used and experienced, with important implications for applications of geospatial data, including emergency management. Detailed interviews with 13 emergency management professionals from eight organisations across five Australian states provided insights into the impacts of VGI on official emergency management. Perceived opportunities presented by VGI included improved communication, acquisition of diverse local information, and increased community engagement in disaster management. Identified challenges included the digital divide, data management, misinformation, and liability concerns. Significantly, VGI disrupts the traditional top-down structure of emergency management and reflects a culture shift away from authoritative control of information. To capitalise on the opportunities of VGI, agencies need to share responsibility and be willing to remain flexible in supporting positive community practises, including VGI. Given the high accountability and inherently responsive nature of decision making in disaster management, it provides a useful lens through which to examine the impacts of VGI on official authoritative systems more broadly. This analysis of the perceptions of emergency management professionals suggests changes to traditional systems that involve decentralisation of power and increased empowerment of citizens, where value is increasingly recognised in both expert and citizen-produced information, initiatives and practises.}

However, relatively few studies within the realm of NBS have reported on experiences in using volunteered information, or their results. This reflects an important gap, not least because of the proliferation of proposals and bids that rely upon or integrate such methods into their approach. We report on experiences with gathering information using a ‘bottom-up’ map-based wiki tool, which effectively sought to crowd-source data, contributed by members of the public and professional stakeholders. As we approach the milestone of ‘10 years on’ from the inception of the website www.daylighting.org.uk, we reflect on our approach, the opportunities presented, constraints encountered, progress made and results delivered. This is contrasted with other resources and data-gathering projects having similar aims for different urban NBS. Findings are presented on the substantive issue of the uptake of deculverting as a particular form of NBS, including land-use contexts, scheme costs and achievement of stated objectives.

The aim of this paper is to investigate the use of data from OpenStreetMap (OSM) to enhance the development of LCZs, complement the existing data sources, and improve the accuracy of the maps. Various features were derived from the OSM database and combined with seasonal LCZ maps. Therefore a methodology was developed and tested for Hamburg, Germany, using a fuzzy approach and then a weighted combination method was applied to combine the inputs from OSM with each of the seasonal LCZ maps. The results showed that improvements can be achieved for certain classes, either in terms of accuracy, e.g. rectifying the misclassification of agricultural areas as heavy industry, or representation on the map, e.g. a more detailed water network. The approach developed is flexible and allows for knowledge about which data sources are more reliable as inputs to the combination and weighting process.}

Remote sensing data, especially the nighttime light images, have been widely used to delineate urbanized areas across the world. Meanwhile, some emerging urban data, such as volunteered geographical information (e.g., OpenStreetMap) and social sensing data (e.g., mobile phone and social media), have also shown great potential in revealing urban boundaries and dynamics. However, consistent and robust methods to quantify urban areas from these multi-source data have remained elusive. Here, we propose a percolation-based method to extract urban areas from these multi-source urban data. We derive the optimal urban/non-urban threshold by considering the critical nature of urban systems with the support of the percolation theory. Furthermore, we apply the method with three open-source datasets – population, road, and nighttime light – to 28 countries. We show that the proposed method captures the similar urban characteristics in terms of urban areas from multi-source data, and Zipf's law holds well in most countries. The accuracy of the derived urban areas by different datasets has been validated with the Landsat-based reference data in 10 cities, and the accuracy can be further improved through data fusion (κ = 0.69–0.85, mean κ = 0.78). Our study not only provides an efficient method to quantify urban areas with open-source data, but also deepens the understanding of urban systems and sheds some light on multi-source data fusion in geographical fields.}

In this paper, we study the integration of VGI in Spatial OLAP (SOLAP) systems, which allow the integration and analysis of large volumes of good quality data. Using a real-world scenario, we highlight some similarities and differences among these two types of systems. We define a conceptual quality-oriented framework for warehousing and OLAPing VGI data. In particular, to address precision and credibility problems related to VGI data, we propose two new ETL operators: aggregation based on the VGI credibility and a filter based on the historical precision. We also define a new spatio-multidimensional model that provides decision makers with a global description of the quality of the aggregated data. To validate our proposal, we extend the classical relational SOLAP architecture using a standard VGI system.}

abstract = {Two dimensional flood inundation models capable of simulating complex spatially and temporally differentiated floodplain flows are routinely used to model and predict flooding. However, advances in modelling techniques have not been matched by improvements in model validation. Validation of flood models remains challenging due to a lack of available spatially-explicit data; traditionally measured data and validation approaches reveal little about the ability of a model to simulate the complex dynamics of floodplain flows, including the pathways, timeline, and impacts of an event. In this paper we propose a novel method for the validation of hydraulic models of flooding using quantitative and qualitative Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI). This method uses VGI data to enhance traditionally measured validation data by reconstructing the observed dynamics of a flood, allowing validation of the temporal and spatial simulation of these dynamics. We illustrate the method using a case study from Corbridge in the northeast of England, using VGI collected through participatory research with people affected by severe flooding in 2015. The results of the study demonstrate that VGI data can be used for the effective reconstruction of flood event dynamics. The results also reveal that the proposed validation approach is able to identify underperformance in the model’s simulation of event dynamics not evaluated by standard global performance measures. Such a lack of evaluation can have adverse consequences where dynamic model outputs are used locally to influence floodplain management. As a result, we propose a new framework for model validation, adopting a pragmatic and flexible approach to examining event dynamics using a diverse range of data.}

In contrast to typical volunteered geographic information applications which rely on the conscious and active contribution of information, most social sensing happens on-the-go, that is, as by-product of human behavior and interaction with technology. Social Sensing has great potential for many applications in urban planning, transportation, crime prevention, health, and so on. In this paper, we focus on a technique called semantic signatures to extract and share high-dimensional data about places. Such semantic signatures reveal how people interact with their environment such as the times they visit places of a certain type (e.g., Winery), how they communicate about such places, and how these places are distributed throughout space. We will provide an overview of signatures, methods to extract them, and highlight examples for their usage from previous work ranging from location privacy and the extraction of regions to reverse geocoding.}

The seven major elements of cybercartography outlined in the first edition have been supplemented by six key ideas, and the definition of cybercartography has been extended and expanded. The new practice of mapping a traditional knowledge (TK) in partnership with indigenous people has led to a new theoretical understanding as well as innovative cybercartographic atlases. The chapter explores the nature of TK as a ‘people’s way of knowing’ and how to best represent this. A cybermap is a physical artifact but also a cognitive and social construct. The chapter considers the relationship between cybercartography and critical cartography, volunteered geographic information and the relationship with the individual user. The holistic nature of cybercartography is explained and important legal and ethical issues are explored. The chapter includes a brief description of key issues reflected in the 22 chapters of the book and concludes that cybercartography meets the challenges posed by Tim Berners-Lee for the Web 3.0 era.}

Volunteered geographical information, in particular OpenStreetMap (OSM), shows great potential in providing the knowledge of human settlements to support humanitarian aid, while the availability and quality of OSM remains a major concern. The majority of existing works in assessing OSM data quality focus on either extrinsic or intrinsic analysis, which is insufficient to fulfill the humanitarian mapping scenario to a certain degree. This paper aims to explore OSM missing built-up areas from an integrative perspective of social sensing and remote sensing. First, applying hierarchical DBSCAN clustering algorithm, the clusters of geo-tagged tweets are generated as proxies of human active regions. Then a deep learning based model fine-tuned on existing OSM data is proposed to further map the missing built-up areas. Hit by Cyclone Idai and Kenneth in 2019, the Republic of Mozambique is selected as the study area to evaluate the proposed method at a national scale. As a result, 13 OSM missing built-up areas are identified and mapped with an over 90% overall accuracy, being competitive compared to state-of-the-art products, which confirms the effectiveness of the proposed method.}

Crowdsourcing modes range from harvesting information passively transmitted by large groups on the web to actively engaging the crowd to generate data by using dedicated mobile apps and web-platforms. The latter, active crowdsourcing projects, were described in more detail by analysing the organizational variables of the twelve projects that were identified. Crowdsourcing has great potential to advance the field of landscape perception & preference research as it enables the in-situ collection of real-time, location-based data. One of the main limitations of reviewed active and passive crowdsourcing modes, lies in the fact that sample selection bias easily occurs and sample representativeness of any target population has been proven hard to achieve. Often crowdsourcing projects are implemented with a strong focus on technical aspects and content, but with insufficient attention for participant engagement. Projects would benefit from more inter- and transdisciplinary approaches and professionalizing campaigns, and thereby bringing participant engagement to the heart of the project. We recommend more attention to be placed towards awareness raising, diversification of formats and activities to reach a larger diversity of participants, structured tracking of performance indicators and learning from participants’ feedback. Such strategies aim at enhancing participation and reducing bias in participant selection, which constrains the usefulness of the results for research, planning and policy.}

abstract = {During the last decade, web technologies and location sensing devices have evolved generating a form of crowdsourcing known as Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI). VGI acted as a platform of spatial data collection, in particular, when a group of public participants are involved in collaborative mapping activities: they work together to collect, share, and use information about geographic features. VGI exploits participants’ local knowledge to produce rich data sources. However, the resulting data inherits problematic data classification. In VGI projects, the challenges of data classification are due to the following: (i) data is likely prone to subjective classification, (ii) remote contributions and flexible contribution mechanisms in most projects, and (iii) the uncertainty of spatial data and non-strict definitions of geographic features. These factors lead to various forms of problematic classification: inconsistent, incomplete, and imprecise data classification. This research addresses classification appropriateness. Whether the classification of an entity is appropriate or inappropriate is related to quantitative and/or qualitative observations. Small differences between observations may be not recognizable particularly for non-expert participants. Hence, in this paper, the problem is tackled by developing a rule-guided classification approach. This approach exploits data mining techniques of Association Classification (AC) to extract descriptive (qualitative) rules of specific geographic features. The rules are extracted based on the investigation of qualitative topological relations between target features and their context. Afterwards, the extracted rules are used to develop a recommendation system able to guide participants to the most appropriate classification. The approach proposes two scenarios to guide participants towards enhancing the quality of data classification. An empirical study is conducted to investigate the classification of grass-related features like forest, garden, park, and meadow. The findings of this study indicate the feasibility of the proposed approach.}

In the case of smartphone apps for fitness tracking, results of this data can be used similar to the growing application of global positioning systems for automotive travel surveying. The authors evaluate data from Travis County, Texas for the purpose of determining where bicyclists ride, primarily for fitness purposes. Ride trip volumes are evaluated with residential and employment density, land use diversity, bicycle facilities and terrain to characterize places chosen for bicycling for health. Though limited to bicycle rides and routes voluntarily logged using the smartphone app, this method provides promise for applications in multi-modal transportation planning and health impact assessment studies.}

abstract = {Developing countries, especially in Africa are faced with a lack of formally registered land. Available limited records are outdated, inaccurate and unreliable, which makes it a challenge to properly administer and manage land and its resources. In the face of such problems, a large proportion of the population in developing countries depends on land and its resources for their sustenance. Developing countries are unable to adopt traditional land administration systems (LAS) due to their lack of capacity and financial constraints. Traditional LAS are characterised by expensive licence fees, procedures, and maintenance structures which are not feasible in developing countries. Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) has the potential to address these challenges by providing timely, affordable, up-to-date, flexible, and fit for purpose (FFP) land information to support the limited current systems. This paper investigates major aspects of developing a conceptual participatory framework for a FFP land administration based on VGI, and conducts a case study in how the system can be applied in local processes, in the context of customary land tenure system in Botswana. The aspects were successfully implemented in the case study area to demonstrate their applicability and roles they could play in ensuring that VGI is reliable and conforms to the legal and institutional regulations of Land Boards. It has further provided an understanding of how VGI can be collected, assessed, and utilized at Land Boards to improve key land transactions on a FFP basis. Furthermore, innovative approaches to Trust and Reputation Modelling (TRM) are presented, minimising the need for ground-truthing of VGI data.}

The proposed PPGIS assesses the age-friendliness of cities through integrating certain criteria weights determined by the elderly with VGI collected by regular citizens. The system was used to create the age-friendliness map of district # 6 of Tehran, Iran. The resulting map shows that the center of the district is more age-friendly than the other areas. Based on the evaluation results, the majority of citizens found the system to be a suitable tool for evaluating the age-friendliness of the city, collecting VGI related to the elderly’s urban environment and helping urban planners improve the age-friendliness of the city. Nonetheless, a rather small percentage of citizens concur that: (i) the PPGIS is a suitable tool for persuading citizens to participate in the city age-friendliness assessment and that (ii) the PPGIS provides a reliable way for assessing the age-friendliness of cities.}

In recent years, with the increasing popularity and use of social media, people have started to express their views, experiences, images, and video evidences through different social media platforms. Consequently, harnessing such crowdsourced information has become an opportunity for authorities to obtain enhanced situation awareness data for efficient disaster management practices. Nonetheless, the current disaster-related Twitter analytics methods are not versatile enough to define disaster impacts levels as interpreted by the local communities. This paper contributes to the existing knowledge by applying and extending a well-established data analysis framework, and identifying highly impacted disaster areas as perceived by the local communities. For this, the study used real-time Twitter data posted during the 2010–2011 South East Queensland Floods. The findings reveal that: (a) Utilising Twitter is a promising approach to reflect citizen knowledge; (b) Tweets could be used to identify the fluctuations of disaster severity over time; (c) The spatial analysis of tweets validates the applicability of geo-located messages to demarcate highly impacted disaster zones.}

The quality indicators represent both the extrinsic quality, depending on the characteristics and reputation of the sources of information; the intrinsic quality, depending on the distinct accuracy and precision of information; and, last but not least, the pragmatic quality, depending on the user needs and intended purposes. In order to assess the pragmatic quality of VGI items, a linguistic decision making approach is defined that allows users to rank and finally filter the VGI items based on the satisfaction of distinct criteria expressed by means of both linguistic terms, defining soft constraints on the distinct quality indicators, and linguistic aggregators, defining fuzzy operators which combine the satisfaction degrees of the soft constraints at distinct hierarchical levels to yield the final satisfaction of the VGI items. Finally, an example of quality assessment in a glaciological citizen science project is discussed.}

The article presents a case study of Reykjavík, Iceland, where a simple ‘emotional mapping’ platform was used to enable cyclists to express their emotional reactions to routes and places. A sample of 100 users identified some 541 features - lines and points - on a map of the city, associated them with either ‘good’ or ‘bad’ emotions and wrote textual comments to elaborate on the reasons for their judgement. The results indicate clearly the importance of the natural environment for cyclists, as well as the negative feeling engendered by cycling close to car traffic or in the street with the cars. These data support the emphases found in the present bicycling plan of Reykjavík city. In general, volunteered geographical information and crowdsourcing has much potential for increasing citizen participation in urban planning. A flexible software platform for participatory mapping, such as the one used in the study, can be a valuable addition to the planner‘s toolbox.}

OSM is known as one of the most extensively used instances of Crowdsourcing Geographic Data (CSGD)/Crowdsourced Geographic Information (CGI), Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI), or the Neogeography paradigm. Economically, OSM development can be beneficial for governments, especially in developing countries such as Iran, where financial support is limited. This paper analyzes the spatial pattern, evolution, density, and diversity of OSM road (OSMr) networks in Iran between 2008 and 2016 and looks to find casual relations between the OSM and census statistics. This is due to the fact that OSMr completeness reflects the importance of OSM data in human life. The diversity of OSM roads further reflects the concerns, requirements, and worthiness of clients about different roads’ information. The results show that the road network in Iran considerably increased from 2008 to 2016, with road length increasing to 489,400 km in 2016 from 4300 km in 2008. In addition, road density grew while road diversity and evenness declined, which could be due to an increase in main roads. These results propose a more considerable need for a more comprehensive approach using VGI to supplement gaps in authoritative data in developing countries.}

Benefits include that data can be collected remotely, relatively simply and at low-cost, it complements other data sources, and can be effective in spatial and temporal analysis of visitation, to assess diverse cultural ecosystem services, evaluate visitor sentiments and assign economic values, with similar results to surveys and/or visitor counts. Limitations include fluctuations in popularity and access to data, that it only represents some visitors, areas and activities, demographic data is often limited, and there are important ethical issues. While more research from more locations is required, overall, social media is likely to be increasingly valuable for research and management of nature-based tourism.}

abstract = {During the last 30years it has become commonplace for epidemiological studies to collect locational attributes of disease data. Although this advancement was driven largely by the introduction of handheld global positioning systems (GPS), and more recently, smartphones and tablets with built-in GPS, the collection of georeferenced disease data has moved beyond the use of handheld GPS devices and there now exist numerous sources of crowdsourced georeferenced disease data such as that available from georeferencing of Google search queries or Twitter messages. In addition, cartography has moved beyond the realm of professionals to crowdsourced mapping projects that play a crucial role in disease control and surveillance of outbreaks such as the 2014 West Africa Ebola epidemic. This paper provides a comprehensive review of a range of innovative sources of spatial animal and human health data including data warehouses, mHealth, Google Earth, volunteered geographic information and mining of internet-based big data sources such as Google and Twitter. We discuss the advantages, limitations and applications of each, and highlight studies where they have been used effectively.}

abstract = {With increasing urbanization, in recent years there has been a growing interest and need in monitoring and analyzing urban flood events. Social media, as a new data source, can provide real-time information for flood monitoring. The social media posts with locations are often referred to as Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI), which can reveal the spatial pattern of such events. Since more images are shared on social media than ever before, recent research focused on the extraction of flood-related posts by analyzing images in addition to texts. Apart from merely classifying posts as flood relevant or not, more detailed information, e.g. the flood severity, can also be extracted based on image interpretation. However, it has been less tackled and has not yet been applied for flood severity mapping. In this paper, we propose a novel three-step process to extract and map flood severity information. First, flood relevant images are retrieved with the help of pre-trained convolutional neural networks as feature extractors. Second, the images containing people are further classified into four severity levels by observing the relationship between body parts and their partial inundation, i.e. images are classified according to the water level with respect to different body parts, namely ankle, knee, hip, and chest. Lastly, locations of the Tweets are used for generating a map of estimated flood extent and severity. This process was applied to an image dataset collected during Hurricane Harvey in 2017, as a proof of concept. The results show that VGI can be used as a supplement to remote sensing observations for flood extent mapping and is beneficial, especially for urban areas, where the infrastructure is often occluding water. Based on the extracted water level information, an integrated overview of flood severity can be provided for the early stages of emergency response.}

Unfortunately, Mexico is one of the countries with the highest unrecorded crime rates worldwide. So, according to different unofficial reports, in 2016, the unrecorded crime rate for common jurisdiction crimes was greater than 90%. Thus, it is not possible to define an efficient decision-making process because the real number of crimes, specially the specific geographic location of these crimes, is not known. In 2016, the official INEGI reported two main factors that contribute with the unrecorded crime rate: corruption and lack of confidence (victim personal information) provided from government security institutions. In recent years, several web and mobile applications have been developed, based on volunteered geographic information scheme to collect criminal anonymous information related to this issue. However, the point to define methodologies that allow us to identify multiple records related to the same crime event is necessary. The main goal of this chapter is to generate public policies and guidelines to improve the administration of justice, taking into consideration certain values of criminal incidence, along with a clear identification of kinds of events presented. Thus, this chapter is oriented to generate statistical data by applying ITC technologies to produce both good and safety policies. In addition to this, a case study focused on the application of artificial intelligence algorithms to analyze and classify crime reports is presented as well.}

Immediate responses by corporations and governments were geared toward building knowledge so that accurate and efficient programs could be devised toward curbing the impacts of the pandemic on society. However, one aspect to this was noted as to the limited availability of data sharing across platforms, systems, and jurisdictions, leading to limited datasets, hence, rendering inaccurate predictions that can be used to contain and limit the virus outbreak. In view of required immediate actions, volunteered geographic information (VGI) and citizen science concept have emerged, where people voluntarily share location and health status data to circumvent data sharing restrictions imposed upon corporations and governments. This is leading to more accurate predictions and supporting an emergence of alternative tools. This chapter explores this dimension and outlines how people, previously aggressively resisting data sharing, do so willingly in times of emergencies.}

In this study, the quality of crowdsourced information from Public Participation GIS (PPGIS) and Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) sources (Flickr, OpenStreetMap (OSM), and Wikipedia) was compared with visitor counts that are presumed to reflect social importance. Using the state of Victoria, Australia as a case study, secondary crowdsourced VGI data, primary crowdsourced (PPGIS data) and visitor statistics were examined for their correspondence and differences, and to identify spatial patterns in park popularity. Data completeness—the percent of protected areas with data—varied between sources, being highest for OSM (90%), followed by Flickr (41%), PPGIS (24%), visitation counts (5%), and Wikipedia articles (4%). Statistically significant correlations were found between all five measures of popularity for protected areas. Using stepwise multiple linear regression, the explained variability in visitor numbers was greater than 70%, with PPGIS, Flickr and OSM having the largest standardized coefficients. The social importance of protected areas varied as a function of accessibility and the types of values (direct or indirect use) expressed for the areas. Crowdsourced data may provide an alternative to visitor counts for assessing protected area social importance and spatial variability of visitation. However, crowdsourced data appears to be an unreliable proxy for the full range of values and importance of protected areas, especially for non-use values such as biological conservation.}

This paper explores the capacity of one increasingly prevalent source of these data, geographically encoded photographs, to capture spatial expressions of place in an urban environment. Geotagged photographs were obtained from the Flickr API to build a geographic database of photographs for the city of Vancouver, Canada from 2001–2012. These data were aggregated to multiple geographic units represented as hexagonal lattices. Spatial patterns of photo aggregation were examined for tessellations that ranged from 0.25ha to 1024ha. Tags associated with each photo were also explored through the notion of ‘tag-space’ at multiple resolutions, or “scales”, of analysis through local log-odds ratios. Results indicate a significant interaction between tag-space semantics and spatial aggregation which suggests that consideration of scale effects should be integral to analysis of this type of tagged VGI for exploring citizens’ sensing of urban environments. The results indicate further that we may have to reconsider the interaction between encoded meaning, the methods used for extracting such meaning from tag-space, and exogenous and endogenous spatial scales of spatial UGC.}

Citizens’ resources in the form of knowledge, skills, as well as their collaboration with authorities have been identified in the governance literature as crucial elements in sustainable development. Technical advancement in internet communication technology (ICT) presents novel opportunities for engaging and leveraging civic knowledge and skills into different levels of governance. These options are still largely unexplored in governance research on urban green infrastructure (UGI). In this paper, we analyse three different digital tools (e-tools) from the perspective of a Scandinavian planning context. We explore how e-tools can support UGI governance and the perceived barriers. The e-tools explored are three digital platforms with a focus on public participation related to UGI. The three e-tools are map-based, i.e., users share information on digital maps: so-called Volunteered Geographic Information. Here, we call them place-based e-tools. We explore and analyse their adoption into UGI governance, the institutional contexts that affect them and also discuss potential of e-tools in place-based governance. Our findings indicate that the analysed tools all facilitate UGI governance in terms of engaging citizens in use, management, and planning of UGI. However, there are challenges to be aware of, such as the digital divide and the importance of clear participatory frameworks. We conclude that place-based e-tools have potential for UGI governance and that there is potential to strengthen links to ‘place’, while continuously testing and challenging new opportunities as technology rapidly develops.}

OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a rich source of openly available, volunteered geographic information that has a high potential to complement these representations. However, identity links between the knowledge graph entities and OSM nodes are still rare. The problem of link discovery in these settings is particularly challenging due to the lack of a strict schema and heterogeneity of the user-defined node representations in OSM. In this article, we propose OSM2KG - a novel link discovery approach to predict identity links between OSM nodes and geographic entities in a knowledge graph. The core of the OSM2KG approach is a novel latent, compact representation of OSM nodes that captures semantic node similarity in an embedding. OSM2KG adopts this latent representation to train a supervised model for link prediction and utilises existing links between OSM and knowledge graphs for training. Our experiments conducted on several OSM datasets, as well as the Wikidata and DBpedia knowledge graphs, demonstrate that OSM2KG can reliably discover identity links. OSM2KG achieves an F1 score of 92.05% on Wikidata and of 94.17% on DBpedia on average, which corresponds to a 21.82 percentage points increase in F1 score on Wikidata compared to the best performing baselines.}

abstract = {Landmarks, objects in the environment used for orientation, navigation and the formation of cognitive maps are often represented in maps as pictograms. In order to support these tasks effectively and efficiently, landmark pictograms also need to be salient, as the map user needs to identify and process them quickly and easily. Two additional relevant characteristics for the usability of landmark pictograms are their meaningfulness and recognition performance. Meaningfulness is required to understand which categories of objects are represented by the pictograms. Ease of recognition prevents the necessity to consult a map repetitively and may support the formation of a cognitive map of the environment. In the present study, we investigated the relation between salience, meaningfulness and recognition performance of OpenStreetMap (OSM) pictograms and the potential effects of the visual complexity of pictograms on these usability characteristics. Salience was measured via eye fixations on specific pictograms, meaningfulness with an explicit continuous scale and recognition performance with a yes/no recognition memory paradigm. Statistical analyses showed that pictograms drew more visual attention if they were visually complex or if their meaning was inapprehensible or ambiguous. Less apprehensible pictograms were also recognized more often. Interestingly, the data indicated that longer fixations could lead to worse recognition performance. Long fixations on a pictogram may increase the likelihood of false recognition in subsequent situations where the pictogram is no longer valid or relevant. Based on the findings, we suggest balancing the meaningfulness and visual complexity of contiguous pictograms to enhance their recognition and to provide an optimal level of salience of single objects.}

In metropolitan areas, more greenways are interconnected, forming a greenway network (GN). A GN is considered to encourage physical activities, but verifying this statement is difficult, as traditional social survey methods do not obtain fine-grain activity geographic data on a large scale. In view of this shortcoming, the volunteered geographic information and the geographic information system techniques were used to describe the distribution of physical activities in a GN, to explore the effects of greenway network features on supporting activities. The 1640-km-long Shenzhen GN was selected as a representative case, and walking, jogging and cycling were chosen as typical activities. The results showed that only a quarter of greenways were with activities. Greenways with dense residences, mixed land-use, advanced street network and large parks yielded positive effects on supporting physical activities, and advanced public transportation further improved activity diversity. Due to the spatial mismatch between the GN distribution and well-developed areas, the GN density showed negative effects on the presence of physical activities; within the greenways in use, the GN density significantly improved activity diversity, indicating the positive effect of network feature on supporting activities. Compared with neighbourhood greenways, city and regional greenways supported more physical activities due to richer natural resources. The findings reveal that GN in green and welldeveloped areas supports physical activities better. Location, green quality and network form are necessary for greenways and should be integrated into GN planning.}

Satellite images also provide important clues to both the past and present surface conditions of other planets, which cannot be validated on the ground. With the volume of satellite imagery continuing to grow, the inadequacy of computerised solutions to manage and process imagery to the required professional standard is of critical concern. Whilst studies find the crowd sourcing approach suitable for the counting of impact craters in single images, images of higher resolution contain a much wider range of features, and the performance of novices in identifying more complex features and detecting change, remains unknown. This paper presents a first step towards understanding whether novices can identify and annotate changes in different geomorphological features. A website was developed to enable visitors to flick between two images of the same location on Mars taken at different times and classify 1) if a surface feature changed and if so, 2) what feature had changed from a pre-defined list of six. Planetary scientists provided “expert” data against which classifications made by novices could be compared when the project subsequently went public. Whilst no significant difference was found in images identified with surface changes by expert and novices, results exhibited differences in consensus within and between experts and novices when asked to classify the type of change. Experts demonstrated higher levels of agreement in classification of changes as dust devil tracks, slope streaks and impact craters than other features, whilst the consensus of novices was consistent across feature types; furthermore, the level of consensus amongst regardless of feature type. These trends are secondary to the low levels of consensus found, regardless of feature type or classifier expertise. These findings demand the attention of researchers who want to use crowd-sourcing for similar scientific purposes, particularly for the supervised training of computer algorithms, and inform the scope and design of future projects.}

Therefore, we compared how mountain bikers, runners and walkers use popular reserves (Daisy Hill Conservation Park, Venman Bushland National Park and Bayview Conservation Area) close to Brisbane, Australia, based on extracted route data from the fitness tracking application MapMyFitness. Routes for all three activity types were displayed and analysed using ArcGIS. Mountain biking was more popular (49% of the 948 routes), than walking (27%) or running (24%) across the three reserves. Route data was effective at predicting the relative popularity of specific trails with significant linear regressions when compared with fixed-point trail counts (R2 = 0.681). Bikers went further, used a greater range of trail combinations and used more reserves per trip than the other two activities. Weekends were popular for all three activities, but more so for biking (57%), than walking (44%), or running (43%). The results highlight how volunteered geographic information complements other trail data allowing urban planners and managers to better assess visitor movements in reserves. A number of specific management challenges were identified, such as bikers using more areas within and across the reserves, and in some cases, the use of private land and unauthorised access points.}

The new practice of mapping a traditional knowledge (TK) in partnership with indigenous people has led to a new theoretical understanding as well as innovative cybercartographic atlases. The chapter explores the nature of TK as a ‘people's way of knowing’ and how to best represent this. A cybermap is a physical artefact but also a cognitive and social construct. The chapter considers the relationship between Cybercartography and critical cartography, volunteered geographic information and the relationship with the individual user. The holistic nature of Cybercartography is explained and important legal and ethical issues are explored.

Volunteered geographic information (VGI) phenomenon offers an alternative mechanism for the acquisition of geospatial information. It has shown its effectiveness in various applications such as disaster management. However VGI suffers from a general lack of metadata quality assurance. This paper proposes an approach that aims to enhance VGI process by evaluating geospatial metadata quality. We introduce a set of indicators for geospatial metadata quality and we propose a method to evaluate them with respect to the context of VGI.}

In the age of Big Data, it is possible to construct gazetteers in a data-driven approach by mining rich volunteered geographic information (VGI) from the Web. In this research, we build a scalable distributed platform and a high-performance geoprocessing workflow based on the Hadoop ecosystem to harvest crowd-sourced gazetteer entries. Using experiments based on geotagged datasets in Flickr, we find that the MapReduce-based workflow running on the spatially enabled Hadoop cluster can reduce the processing time compared with traditional desktop-based operations by an order of magnitude. We demonstrate how to use such a novel spatial-computing infrastructure to facilitate gazetteer research. In addition, we introduce a provenance-based trust model for quality assurance. This work offers new insights on enriching future gazetteers with the use of Hadoop clusters, and makes contributions in connecting GIS to the cloud computing environment for the next frontier of Big Geo-Data analytics.}

The Safecast data are calibrated using observations acquired by the U.S. Department of Energy at the time of the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi power plant nuclear accident. The methodology performs a series of interpolations between the U.S. government and contributed datasets at specific temporal windows and at corresponding spatial locations. The coefficients found for all the different temporal windows are aggregated and interpolated using quadratic regressions to generate a time dependent calibration function. Normal background radiation, decay rates, and missing values are taken into account during the analysis. Results show that the standard Safecast static transformation function overestimates the official measurements because it fails to capture the presence of two different Cesium isotopes and their changing magnitudes with time. A model is created to predict the ratio of the isotopes from the time of the accident through 2020. The proposed time dependent calibration takes into account this Cesium isotopes ratio, and it is shown to reduce the error between U.S. government and contributed data. The proposed calibration is needed through 2020, after which date the errors introduced by ignoring the presence of different isotopes will become negligible.}

With the exponential increase in volunteered geographic information, it is now possible to assess visitation to parks by people using social media. The number of routes posted to MapMyFitness, Strava and Wikiloc were used to assess the relative popularity of 40 national parks in South East Queensland, Australia for mountain biking, walking and running. Then, using generalised linear models, the topographic, geographic, management and environmental variables that best predicted park popularity among users were identified. There were more than 450,000 visits to the parks, with 98% of routes posted on Strava. Distance (road and direct distance) from large urban areas best predicted visitation using routes from MapMyFitness and Strava with three parks within 2 km of urban areas experiencing over 70,000 visits (Strava). For urban parks, recreational trail length best predicted usage, while for more remote parks, the direct distance to urban areas remained the most important factor. In contrast, people using the adventure platform Wikiloc preferred more remote parks with rugged terrain. The results highlight factors affecting park popularity including distance. With the expansion and densification of cities, including in Australia, urban and peri-urban parks are likely to experience increasing levels of use for fitness-based activities while more remote parks may remain attractive among people focused on adventure.}

Challenges include an asymmetric access to technology and GIS skills, as well as the recognition and validation of citizen data. Opportunities, on the other hand, include the possibility for citizens to express their needs to municipalities and the provision of up-to-date, accurate information to urban planners. Due to its bottom-up conceptualization of data collection, VGI could take a leading role in providing spatial information to planning efforts which aim at understanding and improving the realities of informal settlements.}

However, current solutions for land-use discovery based on user-generated data usually rely on an information retrieval mechanism applied on a textual corpus. This causes ad-hoc place labelling with limited semantic meaning. In this line, the present work introduces a novel data-driven methodology that extends existing solutions by means of a classifier based on a pre-defined hierarchy of land categories. Two types of social networks –text-based and venue-based platforms– are utilized to train the classifier, which is then applied to infer the use of the land based on text data in areas where venue data are not available. The approach has been evaluated by using large datasets comprising two large cities, showing an accuracy above 90% in predicting the land-use categories.}

The collection contains local scale imagery covering all parts of Denmark recorded between 1930 and 1990 and thus has the potential to illustrate the changes which took place in the rural landscape as a whole after the Second World War, in ways which are suited for use at local scales. Taking into account that landscape change normally happens at a slow rate relative to the perceptive scale of humans, with fine grained changes taking place continuously in local settings, images of this kind present themselves as a way for the general public to become aware of changes which might otherwise be overlooked. To a still more urbanized population where most people do not have an every-day experience with rural landscape change, the images may be a starting point for a renewed engagement with landscapes, not just perceived as a scenery, but rather as a process of interaction with the environment. In order to inform a wider range of people, in competition with other types of information, the imagery provides a point of reference – a single farm or landscape known to the users – which people without specific training in landscape research can relate to. The use of a crowdsourcing approach in data generation on a webgis application means that the broader public is both involved in the creation of the data and in the discussion about the changes observed, which become visible when comparing old aerial photographs to the present landscape. In combination with the very local nature of the aerial photographs, this opens up the possibility that the images could serve as a communicational bridge between “abstract” scientific knowledge about landscape change (e.g. change in hedgerow density per year) and the local landscapes where people are living. As such, the approach described in this paper may contribute to the objectives set out in the European landscape convention to facilitate an increased understanding of landscape issues among the public through a democratic learning process. The article concludes, that this approach has a huge potential, although some difficulties exist, relating to the challenge of maintaining a focus on the landscape when using a form of communication which is dialogue-based and relatively unstructured compared to approaches embedded within conventional learning environments.}

For coastal and beach managers, it is important to know who visits beaches, when and where they go and what they value. However, as beaches are long linear structures often with multiple access points, collecting this data can be challenging. Using data from the image sharing platform Flickr, we compared temporal and spatial patterns of use between locals, Australian and international tourists along 31 km of beaches in the sixth largest city in Australia, the Gold Coast. Beaches are popular with 9.8% of all images of the Gold Coast on Flickr taken from a beach. Out of the nearly 7,000 images posted by 908 people on, or near, Gold Coast beaches, 2,388 were posted by 124 locals, 964 by other Australians, and 1,444 by 234 international visitors, mainly from the USA, United Kingdom and New Zealand. Australians, including locals, were more likely than international visitors to take images early in the day and on weekends. There were images from almost every section of the beaches along the coast, with locals using more of the beaches, and each group having their own favourite places. Locals used more words to describe the images, and the most common used words were related to geographic location, natural features, time of the day and activities or events. Despite important limitations, including who uses social media platforms such as Flickr and why, data from geolocated social media images can be a low cost, quick and effective way for managers and others to monitor spatiotemporal patterns of use of open spaces in coastal cities, complementing traditional data.}

abstract = {Individualization of tenure through title registration programmes introduced in many African countries after independence with the promise of security of tenure and increased agricultural productivity has, instead, had the opposite effect. Informal land arrangements continue to emerge as a result of the slow pace of land adjudication (formalization) and updating of land information systems. The trend towards computerization of land information systems has only put focus on already existing formal land tenure arrangements, leaving out the informal social tenure arrangements. As a result, there are now many efforts worldwide motivated by the introduction of the Social Tenure Domain Model (STDM), and freely-available and easy-to-use technology tools to identify, document and map land in support of informal land administration arrangements. Actions are made towards the use of community-generated information to support land administration. Using theories from the interplay between formal and informal institutions, this paper discusses the potential outcomes in adopting Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) in land administration in Kenya. Two case studies are presented that demonstrate the complementary-accommodating, versus the substitutive-competing approaches. These are then compared with the formal land adjudication process in Kenya. It is established that because of the direct involvement of the national mapping agency in land adjudication where VGI is utilized, the outcome is a case of formal adoption of VGI, while in the other case, where there is little or no involvement by the national mapping agency, the outcome is more of competition and substitution. The latter is an example in which the VGI is used just like any other information to inform policy making, rather than taking it as the authoritative source. We argue that since informality is – and will always be – part and parcel of land administration in many African countries as a result of ingrained social relations and power structures, adopting crowdsourced land information into existing formal land administration systems should consider the particular land administration process, satisfying innate demands and requirements, thus re-engineered to accommodate VGI.}

abstract = {Research on disaster response frequently uses volunteered geographic information (VGI), due to its capability to provide near real-time information during and after a disaster. It is much less commonly used in spatial planning related to disaster management. However, VGI appears to have considerable potential for use in spatial planning and offers some advantages over traditional methods. For example, VGI can capture residents' preferences in a much faster, more timely, and more comprehensive fashion than is possible with, for example, questionnaires and surveys. This research investigates the usefulness of VGI for planning flood evacuation shelters. Using Jakarta, Indonesia, as a case study, we use VGI to capture the locations of flood evacuation shelters based on residents' preferences during flood periods in 2013–2014 and 2014–2015 and compare these with the locations of official shelters. Floods frequently affect Jakarta and the city administration uses VGI in flood emergency responses. Moreover, Jakarta has been identified as having the largest number of active Twitter users among cities worldwide. Thus, Jakarta is an appropriate place to study the use of VGI for planning evacuation shelters. VGI generated by Twitter users was used to identify the shelter locations preferred by Jakarta residents, and more precisely the flood evacuees. Of 171,046 tweets using keywords relating to flood evacuation, the content of 306 tweets indicated that they had been sent from inside or near evacuation shelters. The spatial pattern showed that those tweets were sent from 215 locations, mostly located near flooded areas. The analysis further showed that 35.6% of these shelter locations preferred by residents intersected with the locations of official evacuation shelters. As a general conclusion, our study demonstrates the advantages of using VGI for spatial planning, which mainly relates to the ease of capturing community preferences over a large area.}

High population density, in conjunction with numerous tourists who visit coastal regions along with wastewater from factories, industrial centers, cities, agricultural activities, especially oil contaminants, are amongst major contributors to pollution in coastal areas. Fortunately, developing countries have recently instigated developmental procedures with the participation of the general public in an effort to protect the environment. Thus, one can perceive the importance of creating an appropriate system, which facilitates public participation in monitoring coastal environments. Such a system would notably provide solutions for many issues of pollution management in coastal regions. The purpose of this study is to design and implement a Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI)-based system through integration of concepts and methods from three areas of Geographic Information System (GIS), coastal pollution management, and public participation in order to monitor coastal pollution. After the implementation phase, Nowshahr port city, Mazandaran Province, Iran, was selected as the study area, wherein tourists, residents, and other present individuals were asked to report observable pollutants at their location. After a 3 day monitoring of coastal regions, 98 reports were registered in the system, indicating high amounts of contamination within the respective coastal area. 86% of the total recorded reports were accounts of accumulation of garbage and other dispersed solid material such as foliage and tree trunks, which were somehow the main source of pollution. 10% and 4% of the remaining reports were related to the wastewater pollution and oil contaminants, respectively. According to survey results, 74% of users were satisfied with ease of use and performance of system (26% voted very good and 48% voted good) amongst whom 67% noted the system as an advantageous and effective tool for monitoring the coastal pollution (31% cases of very good and 36% cases of good).}

Further, knowledge of building usage is necessary to model socio-economic aspects such as the distribution of dwellings and population. In an effort to limit costs and resourcing efforts, users and institutes in research and spatial planning are developing strategies to extract such information from existing geographic base data. Currently, land-use information from official datasets merely distinguishes residential from non-residential building usage, but cannot identify areas of non-residential usage inside residential buildings. Additional data sources are therefore needed to fill this gap. In this paper we propose an approach to process semantic information from user-generated OpenStreetMap (OSM) data to specify non-residential usage in residential buildings. This estimation is based on OSM attributes, so-called tags, which are used to define the extent of non-residential usage. Our objective is to identify the potentials and reveal the limitations of integrating semantic OSM data for the evaluation of building usage. Official statistical data on dwellings and population is used to validate results. Thereby we prove the benefit of integrating OpenStreetMap semantic data to refine the estimation of non-residential floor area in the study area of the German City of Dresden, Saxony.}

An increasing number of volunteers which add value to geospatial data require effective ways of organising and providing access to value-added or newly created data. Metadata records are often unavailable for VGI, making it problematic for users to discover data in the VGI system. This paper discusses potential approaches that can be used to create metadata for VGI. This includes Linked Data, professionally created metadata and metadata created by volunteers. The paper then discusses the shortcomings of these approaches and proposes an unconventional alternative, Geospatial Metadata 2.0. This approach involves VGI users in the creation of metadata, and builds on folksonomies created by them. The paper presents the design and implementation of this idea in a prototype system along with an assessment result. The implementation includes Geospatial Metadata 2.0 add-ons in Geonetwork, and the assessment benefits from the input of metadata experts worldwide. The assessment of the benefits results indicate such an approach of metadata creation is promising and has the potential to be employed in VGI systems.}

abstract = {The recent explosive growth of user-generated geographic information has drawn significant attention from GIS scholars and human geographers. Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) here refers to a key component of such a phenomenon, comprising both a range of practices of geographic information production and dissemination by volunteers as well as new forms of geospatial data produced and curated through various interactive online platforms and mobile devices such as OpenStreetMap (OSM) and Google Maps. VGI constructions have raised questions on spatial knowledge, power, and context. Through a study that examines social constructions of OSM in China, this paper makes two contributions to the existing literature: providing a political economic account of VGI constructions in China and exploring legalities in VGI research. Informed by research in critical GIS, this paper traces political economic transitions in relation to OSM constructions and examines OSM contributors' experiences and how these experiences constitute OSM development and usage. Drawing upon law and society research, this paper investigates how OSM mappers encounter the state's regulatory scheme of online mapping. This legality perspective of spatial data production and usage is a topic rarely explored in VGI studies. With interview data and document analysis, this paper unravels processes of powerful state institutional arrangements to control and invest in VGI simultaneously, entrepreneurs' interest in developing location-based services using VGI data, and experiences from a tech-savvy group in exploring and making VGI. While individual experiences vary, they show efforts of questioning embedded power relations shaping spatial data production in these continuously evolving, contested technoscientific and social landscapes.}

Recent advances in digital communication tools and applications have led to unprecedented advances for VGI. Because official credentials are not required, VGI can include the experiences and perspectives of many people, respond rapidly to local needs, and be more spatially and temporally extensive than traditional approaches. VGI encompasses a wide range of activities, from simple and possibly unintentional actions, such as georeferencing messages or pictures shared on the Internet, to the intentional involvement of volunteers in scientific research. The motivations of volunteers and researchers for these activities are wide and ranging and relate to the products that are generated. This article focuses on intentional efforts by geographers to collect VGI. Two main barriers to adoption of VGI for decision making are concerns about data quality and incomplete representation. Strategies to address these concerns can lead to new discoveries and improved decision making in governance. In this article we introduce VGI, discuss theoretical developments, and relate them to three recent experiences.}

This paper proposes an approach to addressing the technical challenge of propagating updates from timely sources (e.g. OpenStreetMap) to spatial data maintained at separate map scales. The main idea is to establish a multiple representation database (MRDB) for datasets at different scales and time to facilitate incremental update, where linkages between corresponding objects at different datasets are made explicit. First, two ways in which the timely sources can be integrated into official data for incremental update are discussed. To derive the linkages between different datasets, a data matching procedure based on computer vision is presented and fine-tuned to match data in different scale ranges. Furthermore, the generalization history used to produce smaller scale data from the larger ones in official data is inferred based on the linkages, and is then used to guide the update propagation. Finally, a framework for incremental generalization in MRDBs is proposed, where crucial issues like strategies for update propagation, cartographic generalization, and the so-called ‘chain reaction’ are addressed. The framework is implemented as a fully automated process where operators like simplification, enlargement, compression, displacement and typification are incorporated into the incremental update process. By testing the framework against real world data sets (i.e. OpenStreetMap and official data at 1:10k, 1:50k and 1:100k), we show that the updates are integrated consistently into existing data in terms of spatial relations and cartographic quality. Our work suggests that making use of timely sources by official mapping agencies and companies in a continuous or event-driven data update is technically feasible, with further improvement and extensions discussed.}

Most geographic datasets including OpenStreetMap are no exception, as these are affected in terms of a growing location–coordinate mismatch. Current research is aware of this issue but solution strategies have not been fully explored yet. In this manuscript, we discuss how regular systematic updates of coordinate values can be used to address this issue. We explore the recommended frequency to perform such updates for guaranteeing a minimal loss of accuracy after long periods of time. It is further determined how rounding errors impair such systematic updates and in which ways singular and irregular manual updates impede systematic solution strategies. The solution strategies proposed lead to minimal overall errors and thus guarantee to retain high positional accuracy of coordinate pairs within global datasets, even after years of existence.}

We explore the application of this method to a case related to SDG 3 on Health. We document how our approach centered on creating a global academic network designed to engage and empower university students and their faculty mentors to participate in broader efforts to create open, free spatial data on open platforms to inform humanitarian and development objectives outlined by the funding agency, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). This approach expressly links supply and demand for geospatial knowledge by connecting specific needs for geographic information to specific development objectives in targeted places where USAID works to end extreme poverty. We discuss the rationale and context for the methodology as it draws from and builds upon prominent literature of participatory GIS (PGIS) and volunteered geographic information (VGI). We demonstrate how the mapping of building and road infrastructure in Mozambique and Kenya was carried out in order to provide information for an insecticide spray campaign to prevent malaria and protect public health. Throughout these efforts, steps are taken to ensure spatial data quality and to offer opportunities for youth volunteer embeddedness in mapping tasks and themes in places where students otherwise would not engage with real world data or connect with peers from different countries. We reflect on the opportunities and challenges for how this scaled-up “remote participatory sensing” approach to spatial data creation can inform development projects in the context of the SDGs.}

Following a suspected tornadic event, damage surveys are conducted by Environment Canada to determine the extent and severity of damage in order to assign an Enhanced Fujita scale rating. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the process involved in conducting storm damage surveys, and to assess how information gathered during these surveys is used. Primary research for this study involved conducting semi-structured interviews with Environment Canada damage surveyors from various provinces (n=10) and wind engineering researchers from a large public university in Canada (n=2), as well as an onsite observation of a damage survey conducted in Angus, Ontario after a tornado struck on 17 June 2014. The results of this study underscored the subtle but important differences between storm damage surveys conducted in the United States and Canada. It was also found that the majority of damage surveys are now conducted remotely through photos, videos, and telephone interviews with key witnesses. Finally, damage surveys were found to be a critical component of the disaster management cycle by contributing to both risk reduction and preparedness. Introducing sophisticated technologies such as mobile devices and applications, as well as using volunteered geographic information to display damage reports on a web-map, could further improve the damage surveying process in both Canada and abroad.}

While social and environmental justice concerns have been applied to each of these topics individually, this paper addresses VGI, urban forests, and social justice simultaneously. VGI has often been hailed as an empowering and democratic new form of citizen science that allows data collection tasks to be distributed to a large group of people; however, concerns have emerged about whose geographies will be volunteered, and for what purpose. This research addresses these concerns, with an understanding that VGI has the potential to strengthen, rather than dissolve the digital divide. This is accomplished by determining the completeness of coverage of user-generated urban forest mapping on the interactive website PhillyTreeMap (http://www.phillytreemap.org/) by comparing it with high resolution remotely sensed canopy coverage data. These coverage levels are then regressed against Census demographic data at the block group level to determine if there are inequities in the coverage of this urban forest VGI project based upon socioeconomic status. Results indicate that sociodemographic variables influence the likelihood of increased coverage of the VGI urban forest data, presenting equity concerns surrounding the coverage of this VGI urban forest data. The presence of these social and environmental justice concerns indicates the need for expanded research into this new frontier of geographic data. Geographically weighted general linear models show non-stationarity in the relationships between VGI coverage and sociodemographic predictors, demonstrating the importance of incorporating local models.}

Unfortunately, however, social media often lacks geographic metadata or includes geotags that inaccurately reflect the locations of reported events. Toponyms, place names in social media content, provide another source of geographic information yet toponym usage in emergencies remains poorly understood. To address this gap, this study examines toponym usage across 22,343 tweets posted during a severe storm in the Northeastern United States. Tweets were qualitatively coded for nineteen types of storm-related information as well as toponym usage, location reference, and granularity. Findings show that users i) include more geographic information, including toponyms and geotags, in tweets about emergencies than about other topics; ii) report geographically distributed events but tend to include toponyms rather than geotags when reporting local information; and iii) include mostly municipal and regional toponyms in tweets about emergencies but tend to include hyperlocal toponyms and additional municipal or regional markers in reports of infrastructure damage and service disruption. Together these findings offer implications for social sensing applications in emergency response and management. These include more opportunities for course-grained damage assessment than fine-grained situational awareness, and the need for internal and external sources of geographic information to distinguish information about local and remote events. Lastly, findings suggest opportunities for passive and active sensing approaches responsive to the recipient design of social media: users provide additional geographic context that help others distinguish local and remote risks within noisy information spaces that emerge during geographically distributed crises.}

Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) is a process where individuals, supported by enabling technologies, behave like physical sensors to harvest georeferenced content in their surroundings. The value of this, typically heterogeneous, content has been recognized by both researchers and organizations. However, in order to be fruitfully used in various VGI-based types of application reliability and quality of particular VGI content (i.e., Points of Interest) have to be assessed. This evaluation can be based on reputation scores that summarize users’ experiences with the specific content. Following this direction, our contribution provides, primarily, a new comprehensive model and a multi-layer architecture for reputation evaluation aimed to assess quality of VGI content. Secondly, we demonstrate the relevance of adopting such a framework through an applicative scenario for recommending touristic itineraries.}

abstract = {The volunteered geographic information (VGI) gains increasing popularity with the general public and scientific community. However, the optimism about the VGI has been tempered by two critical issues: inequality in data coverage (social justice) and data quality. It therefore requires a better understanding of the mechanism driving VGI contributions and content quality. With a case of China, this paper demonstrates one potential avenue, examining the associations between VGI coverage/quality and local demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. In particular, VGI data are harvested from the OpenStreetMap for 333 cities in China. VGI coverage is measured by the total volume of different geographic features (point, line and polygon); and VGI quality is described from two aspects: completeness and accuracy. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) shows that both demographic and socioeconomic factors have statistically significant influences on VGI coverage and quality. More specifically, densely populous cities with more young, educated and non-agricultural people enjoy higher VGI coverage and quality. Cities with lower VGI coverage and quality are primarily located in the western and southwestern regions where the ethnic minorities concentrate. High VGI coverage and quality are possibly observed in economically developed cities with high marketization degree. Besides, possibility of high VGI coverage and quality occurs in cities with more labor in scientific research and greater percentage of employers in the tertiary industry. The GWR also demonstrates that the strength and nature of the obtained relationships vary across the 333 cities. The spatial non-stationary relationships may partially answer for the controversial empirical conclusions in earlier case studies at different scales. Quantitative analysis (Gini index, Lorenz curve and Moran's I index) further evidences the great inequality in VGI coverage and quality. It can be safely inferred that the differences in engagement and use of VGI, as a new digital divide, can raise troubling concerns on the social justice implications.}

These factors are critical in the process of working with sensitive geographic data in an ethical fashion and ensuring maximum data reliability.

Techniques for collecting, aggregating, and transforming qualitatively mapped data are detailed. Clustering techniques to ready longitudinal recovery metrics for comparison with the participant-derived data are also described.

The datasets are manually labeled for information content and toponym usage. The 22,706 tweet IDs, dehydrated for privacy, are labeled for relevance (storm-related and off-topic) and 19 types of storm-related information organized into six categories: infrastructure damage, service disruption, personal experience, weather updates, weather forecasts, and weather warnings. Data are also labeled for toponym usage (with or without toponyms), location (local, remote, and generic toponyms), and granularity (hyperlocal, municipal, and regional toponyms).

Few studies have explored people's sentiments and perspectives over the process of post-disaster recovery. In this study, a mixed methods approach involving sentiment analysis and Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling is designed for mining sheer volume of tweets about Lombok and Bali, generated by nonlocal Twitter users after a series of earthquakes in the two places in August 2018. The findings mainly suggest that people have generally become less negative about Lombok and Bali over time, despite fluctuations in their sentiment polarities' central tendencies. In addition, dissatisfactions about the housing reconstruction progress, tourism recovery status, and living conditions in the affected areas of Lombok still existed in 2019; contestations have been found with regard to the huge funds for hosting the 2018 Bali IMF-World Bank meeting after the earthquakes. The overall results of this study have proved that the adopted approach can effectively reveal the variations of people's sentiments and perspectives of general and specific issues regarding post-disaster tourism recovery over time.}

abstract = {Integrating both traditional and social media data, this study compares the performance of gravity, neural network, and random forest models of commuting trip distribution in New York City. Trip distribution modeling has primarily employed traditional data sources and classical methods such as the gravity. However, with the emergence of social media during the past decade, the potential for integrating traditional and social media data while utilizing new techniques has been identified. Our findings indicate that the random forest model outperforms the traditional gravity and neural network models. Population, distance, number of Twitter users, and employment were identified as the four most influential predictors of trip distibution by the random forest model. While Twitter flows did not enhance the models' performance, the importance of the number of Twitter users at work destinations implies the potential for using social media data in travel demand modeling to improve the predictive power and accuracy.}

Highly-reliable in-situ location information is critical for rescue efforts during and after disasters, but often such information is not easy or even possible to obtain. The recent technological advancements along with the volunteerism opportunities create the possibility for obtaining the most needed information through citizens via online applications. The paper investigates the role of volunteer crowdsourcing, including its key attributes and relevant technologies, in disaster risk reduction. This study adopts the systematic literature review technique as the methodological approach. The results reveal three major application areas, where the data collection is undertaken through volunteer crowdsourcing—i.e., marketing, communication, disasters. The findings point out to a trend of increasing focus on volunteer crowdsourcing in the disaster risk reduction literature between 2006 and 2018. The study suggests that the adoption of volunteer crowdsourcing systems into practice would assist policymakers and disaster risk managers to make informed decisions before, during and after disasters—hence, could help in reducing risks.}

Unlike Volunteered Geographic Information collection techniques that involve the passive collection of data using location aware devices, the Participatory Geoweb involves the purposeful contribution of location-based information by nonexperts in order to address social and/or environmental issues and to support their inclusion in land related decision-making processes. This growing practice is built on the principles of Participatory Mapping, a well-established methodology that utilizes a range of approaches and techniques including the Participatory Geoweb. Participatory Mapping combines map making with participatory methods to delineate and represent the unique spatial knowledge and lived experiences of local communities. Despite the potential for the Participatory Geoweb to represent a socially or culturally distinct understanding of community spatial knowledge, there remain a number of challenges to both its uptake and efficacy. These challenges include the persistence of the digital divide and the inability of large numbers of people to access the internet with sufficient bandwidth to both view and contribute to the Geoweb; the controversy of data sovereignty and the storage of sometimes sensitive local knowledge in a web-based digital medium; the internet potentially distancing the participants from the immediacy of the issue that the Participatory Geoweb project seeks to address; and the underlying uncertainty and motivations related to the code, algorithms and information displayed on the base maps on which many Participatory Geoweb applications are built.}

The methodology uses publicly available volunteer geographic information, compiled in a spatial database with places (tracks) where these activities occur, in order to measure the use intensity. Results show: (1) the rate of biker and runner compliance with the park's trails, and (2) places where potential conflicts among users are likely to happen. Profiling user's preferences can help managers and decision makers to design proper infrastructure for outdoor activities. Strategic management errors can be avoided by knowing user preferences in urban parks, and by offering improved conditions which meet the expectations and needs of different user groups.
Management implications
This paper presents an efficient method to detect spatial overlaps between different recreational activities which is useful when financial and personnel resources for monitoring visitors in recreational urban green areas are scarce. The dataset comprises Volunteer Geographic Information, publicly available through web sharing services. It constitutes an alternative or a complementary data base compared to direct survey methods. The study revealed the suitability of this methodological approach for the two most popular outdoor recreation activities within urban parks – mountain biking and running.}

These practices are enabled by an array of spatial and digital technologies that also facilitate the growth of the so-called volunteered geographic information (VGI) regarding contributions from users without training in conventional GIS or cartography. In the growing body of work on VGI, however, not much attention has been given to the emergence of such sound maps as part of the VGI constructions. Meanwhile, research in soundscape has not addressed the aspect of crowd-sourcing or user-generated contributions facilitated by new information and communication technologies. This article seeks to bridge this gap. It draws upon important insights from critical GIS research into investigating VGI as visual practices, while it is also informed by three areas of soundscape research including mapping soundscapes, tracing the production of soundscapes and exploring embodied experiences with soundscapes. Through an empirical case in China, this article suggests a two-level analytical framework: investigating in what ways crowd-sourced sound maps emerge and interpreting these sounds on their shared platforms. In so doing, this study calls for more engagement with the multi-modality aspect of visuality in mappings, which in turn may have implications for landscape design and planning. In this way, it seeks to enrich the discussion on critical visualization.}

However, more than a technical feature, VGI has brought to light the political aspects of cartography, when multiple stakeholders have access to mapping tools. This is the case of the collaborative mapping strategies used to map North Korea, one of the most, if not the most, closed countries in the world in terms of diplomatic relations, tourism and its economy. OpenStreetMap (OSM) enables “armchair mappers” to map opaque territories in which local governments control citizens’ access to the internet. In this paper, we discuss the following questions: Who is mapping North Korea in OSM? Which tools and methods do contributors use to gain access to information about the country and to represent it? What are the motivations behind this mapping endeavor? We analyze technical aspects of OSM data for North Korea and structured correspondence exchanged with 889 contributors. We argue that crowdsourced efforts can make good the dearth of knowledge resulting from the physical, cultural and political barriers associated with uncharted territories and that, although the motivations for such efforts vary greatly, they all have their origin in a sense of empathy and the power technology has to penetrate geopolitical barriers.}

This can be provided by Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) which are a low-cost means of collecting updated information about rivers. Another valuable resource is Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) which is a comparatively new means of improving the coverage of monitored areas because it is able to supply supplementary information to the WSN and thus support decision-making in flood risk management. However, there still remains the problem of how to combine WSN data with VGI. In this paper, an attempt is made to investigate AGORA-DS, which is a Spatial Decision Support System (SDSS) that is able to make flood risk management more effective by combining these data sources, i.e. WSN with VGI. This approach is built over a conceptual model that complies with the interoperable standards laid down by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) – e.g. Sensor Observation Service (SOS) and Web Feature Service (WFS) – and seeks to combine and present unified information in a web-based decision support tool. This work was deployed in a real scenario of flood risk management in the town of São Carlos in Brazil. The evidence obtained from this deployment confirmed that interoperable standards can support the integration of data from distinct data sources. In addition, they also show that VGI is able to provide information about areas of the river basin which lack data since there is no appropriate station in the area. Hence it provides a valuable support for the WSN data. It can thus be concluded that AGORA-DS is able to combine information provided by WSN and VGI, and provide useful information for supporting flood risk management.}

Annual census of this species started in 1991. It usually took one observer 1–2 months to complete the census and even then, it was not logistically reasonable to include some areas with very steep slope in the core of the protected area. In order to bypass these constraints, an alternative and ambitious monitoring scheme that would allow estimating the whole species throughout its entire range was proposed in 2007. The new scheme, which complemented and improved previous estimates, consisted in performing a thorough instantaneous census using a distance sampling approach, thus allowing a detailed snapshot of effective occupation, density, habitat preferences and distribution range of the Azores Bullfinch. The Priolo Atlas turned into a volunteered geographic information and citizen science-based ornithological initiative which every 4 years congregates more than 50 well-trained volunteers in the Azores. With the first two editions (2008 and 2012), this initiative has already established itself as a critical tool to monitor the population of this endemic species.}

This analysis uses VGI describing land cover that was captured using a web-based interface, linked to Google Earth. A number of control points, for which the land cover had been determined by experts allowed measures of the reliability of each volunteer in relation to each land cover class to be calculated. Geographically weighted kernels were used to estimate surfaces of volunteered land cover information accuracy and then to develop spatially distributed correspondences between the volunteer land cover class and land cover from 3 contemporary global datasets (GLC-2000, GlobCover and MODIS v.5). Specifically, a geographically weighted approach calculated local confusion matrices (correspondences) at each location in a central African study area and generated spatial distributions of user's, producer's, portmanteau, and partial portmanteau accuracies. These were used to evaluate the global datasets and to infer which of them was ‘best’ at describing Tree cover at each location in the study area. The resulting maps show where specific global datasets are recommended for analyses requiring Tree cover information. The methods presented in this research suggest that some of the concerns about the quality of VGI can be addressed through careful data collection, the use of control points to evaluate volunteer performance and spatially explicit analyses. A research agenda for the use and analysis of VGI about land cover is outlined.}

In this paper, we present the GeoCONAVI (Geographic CONtext Analysis for Volunteered Information) approach and a prototype system, designed to retrieve, process, analyze and evaluate social media content on forest fires, producing relevant, credible and actionable VGI usable for crisis events. The novelty of the approach lies in the enrichment of the content with additional geographic context information, and use of spatio-temporal clustering to support scoring and validation. Thus, the system is focusing on integrating authoritative data sources with VGI. Evaluation in case studies shows that the prototype system can handle large amounts of data with common-off-the-shelf hardware, produces valuable results, and is adaptable to other types of crisis events.}

With recent advances in activity-based land use, transportation, and environment (LUTE) models, such disaggregated land use data become important to allow LUTE models to analyze and simulate a person’s choices of work location and activity destinations and to understand policy impacts on future cities. These data can also be used as alternatives to explore economic activities at the local level, especially as government-published census-based disaggregated employment data have become less available in the recent decade. Our new approach provides opportunities for cities to estimate land use at high resolution with low cost by utilizing VGI while ensuring its quality with a certain accuracy threshold. The automatic classification of POI can also be utilized for other types of analyses on cities.}

abstract = {Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) offers a potentially inexpensive source of reference data for estimating area and assessing map accuracy in the context of remote-sensing based land-cover monitoring. The quality of observations from VGI and the typical lack of an underlying probability sampling design raise concerns regarding use of VGI in widely-applied design-based statistical inference. This article focuses on the fundamental issue of sampling design used to acquire VGI. Design-based inference requires the sample data to be obtained via a probability sampling design. Options for incorporating VGI within design-based inference include: 1) directing volunteers to obtain data for locations selected by a probability sampling design; 2) treating VGI data as a “certainty stratum” and augmenting the VGI with data obtained from a probability sample; and 3) using VGI to create an auxiliary variable that is then used in a model-assisted estimator to reduce the standard error of an estimate produced from a probability sample. The latter two options can be implemented using VGI data that were obtained from a non-probability sampling design, but require additional sample data to be acquired via a probability sampling design. If the only data available are VGI obtained from a non-probability sample, properties of design-based inference that are ensured by probability sampling must be replaced by assumptions that may be difficult to verify. For example, pseudo-estimation weights can be constructed that mimic weights used in stratified sampling estimators. However, accuracy and area estimates produced using these pseudo-weights still require the VGI data to be representative of the full population, a property known as “external validity”. Because design-based inference requires a probability sampling design, directing volunteers to locations specified by a probability sampling design is the most straightforward option for use of VGI in design-based inference. Combining VGI from a non-probability sample with data from a probability sample using the certainty stratum approach or the model-assisted approach are viable alternatives that meet the conditions required for design-based inference and use the VGI data to advantage to reduce standard errors.}

abstract = {Current implementations of gazetteers, geographic directories that associate place names to geographic coordinates, cannot use semantics to answer complex queries (most gazetteers are just thesauri of place names), use domain ontologies for place name disambiguation, make their data sets available in the Semantic Web or support the use of Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI). A new generation of gazetteers has to tackle these problems. In this paper, we present a new architecture for gazetteers that uses VGI and Semantic Web tools, such as ontologies and Linked Open Data to overcome these limitations. We also present a gazetteer, the Semantic Web Interactive Gazetteer (SWI), implemented using this architecture, and show that it can be used to add absent geographic coordinates to biodiversity records. In our tests, we use this gazetteer to correct geographic data from a big sample (around 142,000 occurrence records of Amazonian specimens) from SpeciesLink, a big repository of biodiversity collection records from Brazil. The tests showed that the SWI Gazetteer was able to add geographic coordinates to around 30,000 records, increasing the records with coordinates from 30.29% to 57.5% of the total number of records in the sample (representing an increase of 90%).}

They can be employed to reveal the tourists’ preference on landmarks and routings of tourism. Most of existing works on routing searches are based on the trajectories of GPS-enabled devices’ users. From a distinct point of view, we attempt to propose a novel approach in which the basic unit of routing is separate road segment instead of GPS trajectory segment. In this paper, we build a recommendation system that provides users with the most popular landmarks as well as the best travel routings between the landmarks. By using Flickr geotaggged photos, the top ranking travel destinations in a city can be identified and then the best travel routes between the popular travel destinations are recommended. We apply a spatial clustering method to identify the main travel landmarks and subsequently rank these landmarks. Using machine learning method, we calculate the tourism popularity of the road in terms of relevant parameters, e.g., the number of users and the number of Point-of-Interests. These popularity assessments are integrated into the routing recommendation system. The routing recommendation system takes into consideration both the popularity assessment and the length of the road. The best route recommended to the user minimizes the distance while including maximal tourism popularity. Experiments were conducted in two different scenarios. The empirical results show that the recommendation system is able to provide the user good travel planning including both top ranking landmarks and suitable routings in a city. Besides, the system offers user-generated semantic information for the recommended routes.}

Rural building annotations exist in OpenStreetMap (OSM), but their quality and quantity are not sufficient for training models that can create accurate rural building maps. The problems with these annotations essentially fall into three categories: (i) most commonly, many annotations are geometrically misaligned with the updated imagery; (ii) some annotations do not correspond to buildings in the images (they are misannotations or the buildings have been destroyed); and (iii) some annotations are missing for buildings in the images (the buildings were never annotated or were built between subsequent image acquisitions). First, we propose a method based on Markov Random Field (MRF) to align the buildings with their annotations. The method maximizes the correlation between annotations and a building probability map while enforcing that nearby buildings have similar alignment vectors. Second, the annotations with no evidence in the building probability map are removed. Third, we present a method to detect non-annotated buildings with predefined shapes and add their annotation. The proposed methodology shows considerable improvement in accuracy of the OSM annotations for two regions of Tanzania and Zimbabwe, being more accurate than state-of-the-art baselines.}

author = {Paul Galpern},
abstract = {Background
Walkshed modelling is a popular way of estimating where people are likely to walk when presented with a network of streets and sidewalks. One approach describes walksheds as regions accessible on foot from a point of origin by taking into account the topology of streets in a neighbourhood. While these models are useful explorations of urban form, they are limited by describing only the potential for walking. They are not representations of where people actually walk.
Aim
The location history collected by mobile phones presents a new opportunity to validate these models using high spatial and temporal resolution data describing actual movement. Here we demonstrate applications of volunteered geographic information to probe walking behaviour, drawing upon a pilot study of University of Calgary students in 2016.
Methods
Using approximately 10,000,000 GPS points from 30 university students (2013 to 2016; 51 person-years of data) we ask where, how far, and how often our participants walked over a three-year period. We also introduce a continuous modelling approach that describes the potential for urban form to limit walking (“the walk warp”) and test this against evidence of actual movement.
Results
We identified 593 walking bouts (1-5km/h, lasting at least 6 minutes), a number that was exceeded by vehicular bouts (2423; > 5 km/h lasting at least 6 minutes). Using the primary residences of our participants as points of origin, we found that an individual’s walking behaviour was correlated with the walk–warp of their neighbourhood.
Conclusion
Volunteered mobile phone data are cost-effective and easy to collect. They provide an accessible means to measure walking behaviour, and as we have demonstrated in our pilot study, can be applied to test theoretical assumptions about the walkability of neighbourhoods.}

Citizen science has existed for centuries, but the recent adoption of information and communications technology (ICT) in this field (e.g. web- or mobile application-based interfaces for citizen training and data generation) has led to a massive surge in popularity, mainly due to reduced geographic barriers to citizen participation. Several challenges exist, however, to effectively utilize citizen-generated data for monitoring IAS (or other species of interest) at the global scale. Here, we conducted a systematic analysis of citizen science initiatives collecting IAS data using ICT, hoping to better understand their scientific contributions and challenges, their similarities/differences, and their interconnections. Through a search of the Scopus database, we identified 26 initiatives whose data had been used in scientific publications related to IAS, and based our analyses on these initiatives. The most common scientific uses of these citizen science data were to visualize the spatial distribution of IAS, better understand their behaviour/phenology, and elucidate citizen science data quality issues. To alleviate data quality concerns, most initiatives (19/26) had mechanisms for verifying citizen observations, such as user-submitted photographs. While many initiatives collected similar data parameters for each species observation, only 54% of the initiatives had a practice of data sharing. This lack of data sharing causes fragmentation of the citizen-generated IAS data, and is likely inhibiting the wider usage of the data for scientific studies on IAS involving large geographic scales (e.g. regional or global) and/or broad taxonomic scopes. To reduce this fragmentation and better consolidate the collected citizen science data, finally we provide some general data sharing guidelines for citizen science initiatives as well as individual volunteers.}

Dealing with data and specifically GI brings with it a number of issues that change the way usability and user centred design can be applied. This paper describes the outcomes of a workshop held in March 2010 exploring the core issues relating to GI usability. The workshop brought together an international group of twenty experts in both human factors and GI, from a wide range of academic and industrial backgrounds. These experts considered three key issues, the stakeholders in GI, key challenges applying usability to GI and the usability methods that can be successfully applied to GI. The result of this workshop was to identify some areas for future research, such as the production of meaningful metadata and the implications of blurring of the line between data producers and data consumers.}

In the context of climate change, the dynamics of snow cover play a crucial role in rebalancing the global energy and water budgets. Remote sensing, hydrological modeling and in situ observations are three techniques frequently utilized for snow cover investigations. However, the uncertainties caused by systematic errors, scale gaps, and complicated snow physics, among other factors, limit the usability of these three approaches in snow studies. In this paper, an overview of the advantages, limitations and recent progress of the three methods is presented, and more effective ways to estimate snow cover properties are evaluated. The possibility of improving remotely sensed snow information using ground-based observations is discussed. As a rapidly growing source of volunteered geographic information (VGI), web-based geotagged photos have great potential to provide ground truth data for remotely sensed products and hydrological models and thus contribute to procedures for cloud removal, correction, validation, forcing and assimilation. Finally, this review proposes a synergistic framework for the future of snow cover research. This framework highlights the cross-scale integration of in situ and remotely sensed snow measurements and the assimilation of improved remote sensing data into hydrological models.}

abstract = {With the evolution of geographic information capture and the emergency of volunteered geographic information, it is getting more important to extract spatial knowledge automatically from large spatial datasets. Spatial co-location patterns represent the subsets of spatial features whose objects are often located in close geographic proximity. Such pattern is one of the most important concepts for geographic context awareness of location-based services (LBS). In the literature, most existing methods of co-location mining are used for events taking place in a homogeneous and isotropic space with distance expressed as Euclidean, while the physical movement in LBS is usually constrained by a road network. As a result, the interestingness value of co-location patterns involving network-constrained events cannot be accurately computed. In this paper, we propose a different method for co-location mining with network configurations of the geographical space considered. First, we define the network model with linear referencing and refine the neighborhood of traditional methods using network distances rather than Euclidean ones. Then, considering that the co-location mining in networks suffers from expensive spatial-join operation, we propose an efficient way to find all neighboring object pairs for generating clique instances. By comparison with the previous approaches based on Euclidean distance, this approach can be applied to accurately calculate the probability of occurrence of a spatial co-location on a network. Our experimental results from real and synthetic data sets show that the proposed approach is efficient and effective in identifying co-location patterns which actually rely on a network.}

We quantified and compared the number of visits for different types of parks in Beijing using freely available geotagged check-in data from social media. We investigated how park attributes, park location, park context and public transportation affected the number of park check-in visits, using multiple linear regressions. Despite potential biases in the use of social media data, using a park typology, we found that the number of visits was significantly different among different types of parks. While cultural relics parks and large urban parks had larger numbers of visits, neighborhood parks had higher visitation rates per unit of area. Park size and entrance fees were associated with increased numbers of visits for all types of parks. For parks that mainly serve local residents, the distance to urban center significantly affected park use. The number of bus stops was positively correlated with park visits, suggesting that increased accessibility through public transportation leads to more visits. The results indicated that improving park accessibility via public transportation and planning small, accessible green spaces in residential areas were effective in improving park use.}

The design of these dashboards typically consolidates information into a single view for government and industry to efficiently and effectively monitor the performance of urban systems – such as those of energy, built form, transport, culture, performance, innovation and health. Many of these dashboards focus on a one-way flow of data and thus do not cater specifically to the functions of public participation, community engagement and collaboration. With growing concerns in digital democracy, there is an increasing demand for software and tools that maximise human-centred design elements and include such participatory and collaborative features. The current trajectory of their development can be reframed to support this. This review frames a more porous definition of the term, integrating the concept of the urban dashboard among other existing digital urban planning methods and tools. It highlights the potential for further work to integrate with emerging media such as virtual, augmented and mixed realities. Reflecting on a diverse range of literature, the result of this paper is a classification system and key recommendations for development and understanding participatory urban dashboards as they fall within the existing lexicon of Smart City platforms and technologies.}

While traditional mapping is nearly exclusively coordinated and often also carried out by large organisations, crowdsourcing geospatial data refers to generating a map using informal social networks and web 2.0 technology. Key differences are the fact that users lacking formal training in map making create the geospatial data themselves rather than relying on professional services; that potentially very large user groups collaborate voluntarily and often without financial compensation with the result that at a very low monetary cost open datasets become available and that mapping and change detection occur in real time. This situation is similar to that found in the Open Source software environment. We shortly explain the basic technology needed for crowdsourcing geospatial data, discuss the underlying concepts including quality issues and give some examples for this novel way of generating geospatial data. We also point at applications where alternatives do not exist such as life traffic information systems. Finally we explore the future of crowdsourcing geospatial data and give some concluding remarks.}

Volunteered geographic information (VGI), or geographic information voluntarily created by private citizens enabled through technologies like social media and web-based mapping, has changed the ways people create and use information for crisis events. Research has focussed on disaster response while largely ignoring prevention and preparedness. Preparing for disasters can reduce negative impacts on life and property, but despite strategies to educate communities, preparation remains low. This study assesses the application and value of VGI in bushfire risk reduction through a participatory mapping approach. It examines VGI as a social practice and not simply a data source by considering the user experience of contributing VGI and the potential for these activities to increase community connectedness for building disaster resilience. Participatory mapping workshops were held in bushfire-risk communities in Tasmania. Workshop activities included a paper-mapping exercise and web-based digital mapping. Survey results from 31 participants at three workshops indicated the process of mapping and contributing local information for bushfire preparation with other community members can contribute to increased social connectedness, understanding of local bushfire risk, and engagement in risk reduction. Local knowledge exchange was seen as valuable, but the social dimension appeared even more engaging than the specific information shared. Participants reported collaborative maps as effective for collating and sharing community bushfire information with a preference for digital mapping. Some limitations of online sharing of information were also reported by participants, however, including potential issues of privacy, data quality and source trustworthiness. Further work is needed to extrapolate findings from the study sample to the broader population.}

In this paper, we use data from the activity tracking app Strava to examine where people in Glasgow cycle and how new forms of data could be utilised to better understand cycling patterns. We propose a method for augmenting the data by comparing the observed link flows to the link flows which would have resulted if people took the shortest route. Comparing these flows gives some expected results, for example, that people like to cycle along the river, as well as some unexpected results, for example, that some routes with cycling infrastructure are avoided by cyclists. This study proposes a practical approach that planners can use for cycling plans with new/emerging cycling data.}

abstract = {Landscape scenery is inherently difficult to conceptualize because of its perceptual nature. Yet landscapes are an extremely important resource for tourism and quality of life so there is a need to classify and manage landscapes. This paper shows how viewshed analysis based on the known location and direction of a photo can be used to tag a photo and this provides a method for assessing the New Zealand Landscape Classification. GIS visibility and overlay functions are combined with digital elevation data and a landscape classification to produce the tagged photos. This tool links an oblique view with multiple distance perspectives to a GIS dataset. There are complexities associated with distance perspectives and the appropriate balance of foreground and distant landscape. This paper argues that the benefits of automated tagging of landscape photos are threefold. The process of modelling landscape tags forces researchers to confront the complexity of landscape character classification. This in turn leads to improved methods for representing and classifying landscape character. Secondly, once tagging methods have been developed then people may choose to use these tools rather than to manually tag photos. Thirdly, such a tool provides the opportunity to utilize the increasingly important volunteered geographic information on the Internet for understanding landscape categories. Landscape photographs and associated tags on the Internet provide insight about landscape categories employed by the public. This could lead to the development of what is labelled “tag clouds” and a landscape “folksonomy”.}

Tourism-driven development in this area, echoing the longing of urban residents for recreational and leisure space, provides an alternative to conventional urbanization approaches. Particularly, in view of heightened conflicts and fierce competitions that often occur in the area, developing the knowledge of the co-visitation network, or how different attractions and villages interact with each other from the visitors’ perspective, is key to more informed planning strategies. With the rapid development of online social media platforms and mobile devices, researchers can collect massive real-time data on the basis of online user-generated content. While there are already many attempts on its application on tourism design, few studies to date have explored how peri-urban attractions and villages are organized in same trips. In this paper, we design a new methodology on the basis of social media analytics to construct and map a co-visitation network, and apply NetMiner-enabled social network analysis to explain its structure and nodal functions. The usefulness of this methodology is demonstrated through a detailed case study in Shenzhen, China. Research findings reveal types of existing co-visitation patterns, which help planners predict future trends, design new experiences and take specific measures in line with visitor demands.}

The potential for synthesis and integration across four broad domains of PM (indigenous/rural/community, urban/regional, environmental/natural resource, and mapping technology) was examined at the Participatory Mapping/GIS 2017 conference held at California Polytechnic State University (San Luis Obispo, USA) Jul 31-Aug 3, 2017. At the conference, PM leaders in each of the four domains participated in working groups to: (1) identify the key issues, including “barriers” and “knowledge gaps” that limit effective PM outcomes, and (2) identify the most important research priorities. This paper summarizes the findings of the working groups for the purpose of identifying common and unique challenges across the four PM domains and to discuss the desirability of stronger integration of PM knowledge and practice. In the indigenous/rural/community domain, achieving clarity in PM purpose and building trust in the process were identified as the most critical issues; in the environmental/natural resources domain, wider use and adoption of PM to inform policy and management decisions through stakeholder engagement was considered most important; and in the urban/regional domain, developing urban indicators and adapting PM to complex and heterogeneous urban environments were identified as important needs. The key issue in the domain of PM technology was understanding how technology influences PM usability and user behavior for the development and implementation of appropriate PM technology. The most significant cross-cutting theme to emerge across all PM domains was the need to evaluate PM outcomes to provide evidence of success.}

abstract = {Introduction
Traffic jams, congestion and pollution demand sustainable modes of transport. To increase the appeal of cycling, bicycle-users' perceptions and needs should be acknowledged by decision-makers. However, traditional transport planning mainly focuses on quantitative, infrastructural data. To address this gap, this study explores to what extent decision-makers are aware of cyclists' needs and perceptions. Furthermore, the study compares the assessments about cycling of decision-makers and cyclists in the city of Leipzig, Germany.
Methods
Qualitative Interviews with 13 cyclists and similarly structured interviews with 6 experts from politics and planning were compared using qualitative content analysis. Two main topics were examined: (1) the reasons for cycling and (2) the perceived environment (built, natural and individually perceived). To integrate the spatial context, the interviewees draw sketch maps which were analyzed and compared using geo-information systems.
Results
Experts assume that main roads with cycling infrastructure are decisive for fast and safe cycling and cyclists agree with this statement. However, cyclists further refer to the positive effects of green spaces, the experience of the natural environment (e.g. fresh air) as well as the healthy and recreational effect of cycling. Cyclists prefer taking side roads and are prepared to use detours to integrate the natural environment and avoid traffic jams, noise and air pollution – these aspects were rarely acknowledged by decision-makers.
Discussion
We conclude that urban planners need to involve cyclists' perceptions more explicitly. Integrating cyclists' experiences in planning processes using sketch maps and interviews are beneficial, complementing quantitative approaches to enhance the understanding of cyclist behavior. The findings are essential to stress the importance of participatory approaches in urban planning to promote a sustainable, healthy and environmentally friendly urban development appropriate to citizens' needs.}

In identifying these challenges and in making appropriate recommendations for future direction, it is vital that we learn from the past by taking a constructively critical appraisal of highly-praised projects in this field, which through real-world implementations have pioneered the use of crowdsourced geospatial data in modern disaster management. These real-world applications represent natural experiments, each with myriads of lessons that cannot be easily gained from computer-confined simulations. This paper reports on lessons learnt from a 3-year implementation of a highly-praised project- the PetaJakarta.org project. The lessons presented derive from the key success factors and the challenges associated with the PetaJakarta.org project. To contribute in addressing some of the identified challenges, desirable characteristics of future social media-based disaster mapping systems are discussed. It is envisaged that the lessons and insights shared in this study will prove invaluable within the broader context of designing socio-technical systems for crowdsourcing and harnessing disaster-related information.}

This type of information is traditionally collected through structured energy surveys and statistics, which is often cost-formidable and labor-intensive. As free communication platforms with massive amounts of public opinions, social media can be used as a new lens for examining the dynamics of social perception towards both fossil and renewable energy. Compared with energy surveys, the analytics of social media leverage crowd-sourced public opinions instead of those from a directed and targeted audience. Based on a preliminary pilot study, we compare Twitter-based data mining results with a recent survey in three regions with different historic ties to fossil and renewable energy. We identify the critical issues associated with social advocacy and sentiment over energy development and consumption, and summarize policy implications. Furthermore, we discuss opportunities and challenges of using social media for understanding energy-related public perception. We conclude that more social media research on energy-related perception may lead to an in-depth understanding of polarized social perception, social contexts of energy policies, and possible strategies of bridging the gaps in and expanding the energy market.}

abstract = {A number of recent studies have examined the effect of installing physical barriers or otherwise restricting access to public sites that are frequently used for suicides by jumping. While these studies demonstrate that barriers lead to a reduction in the number of suicides by jumping at the site where they are installed, thus far no study has found a statistically significant reduction in the local suicide rate attributable to a barrier. All previous studies are case studies of particular sites, and thus have limited statistical power and ability to control for confounding factors, which may obscure the true relationship between barriers and the suicide rate. This study addresses these concerns by examining the relationship between large, well-known bridges (“local landmark” bridges) of the type that are often used as suicide-jumping sites and the local suicide rate, an approach that yields many more cases for analysis. If barriers at suicide-jumping sites decrease the local suicide rate, then this implies that the presence of an unsecured suicide-jumping site will lead to a higher local suicide rate in comparison to areas without such a site. The relationship between suicides and local landmark bridges is examined across 3116 US counties or county equivalents with negative binomial regression models. I found that while exposure to local landmark bridges was associated with an increased number of suicides by jumping, no positive relationship between these bridges and the overall number of suicides was detected. It may be impossible to conclusively determine if barriers at suicide-jumping sites reduce the local suicide rate with currently available data. However, the method introduced in this paper offers the possibility that better data, or an improved understanding of which potential jumping sites attract suicidal individuals, may eventually allow researchers to determine if means restriction at suicide-jumping sites reduces total suicides.}

This article overviews accessible techniques for point pattern analysis, which are usually supported by a geographical information system, statistical software such as R, or implementation via programming languages. The issue of scale is of paramount importance and it is important to keep in mind that it will influence the result: a spatial phenomenon may show significant clustering at fine scale but not at a coarser resolution. A sensitivity analysis that evaluates the effect of scale on the resulting point pattern is desirable.}

Geographical citizen science denotes a subset, whereby locational information is integral to the scientific study. While enjoying resurgence in recent decades, largely associated with burgeoning Internet and communication technologies and societal shifts toward increased civic participation in government and other professional activities, citizen science is not new. There are centuries-old known cases of citizens collecting data for scientific endeavors, such as the recording of bird sightings. Today, citizen science encompasses a much wider variety of practices. These include donating idle computing power for data analysis, processing data through interpreting images or playing games, observing and submitting records of phenomena in the physical world, or even scientific problem definition and project design. Citizen science challenges the traditional notion that scientific knowledge production is reserved for professionals and offers numerous opportunities for both geographic science and citizens, such as reducing time and resource costs and increased public engagement in science. But there are also important considerations, including issues of uneven societal access to participation, geographic and other sampling biases, data quality, and participant motivation, among others.}

This would alleviate the computational cost for extracting features on each individual tweet. On the other hand, much information on the population could be lost as the distribution of textual features of a population could be important for identifying the health index of that population. In addition, there could be relationships between features and those relationships could also convey predictive information of the health index. In this paper, we propose mid-level features namely kernel-based features for prediction of health indices of populations from social media data. The kernel-based features are extracted on the distributions of textual features over population tweets and encode the relationships between individual textual features in a kernel function. We implemented our features using three different kernel functions and applied them for two case studies of population health prediction: across-year prediction and across-county prediction. The kernel-based features were evaluated and compared with existing features on a dataset collected from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System dataset. Experimental results show that the kernel-based features gained significantly higher prediction performance than existing techniques, by up to 16.3%, suggesting the potential and applicability of the proposed features in a wide spectrum of applications on data analytics at population levels.}

Nevertheless, CS projects in environmental epidemiology remain scarce. This is because little attention has been paid to evaluate associations of environmental exposures with health effects directly. This narrative review aims to promote the understanding and application of CS in environmental epidemiology. There are many commonalities between CS and other participatory approaches in environmental epidemiology. Yet, CS can foster the democratization of scientific governance and enhance the sustainability of research projects more effectively than other existing participatory approaches. This is especially the case in projects where citizens are invited to participate, engage and become involved throughout all the phases of a research project (co-created projects). This paper identifies various challenges and opportunities specific to the implementation of co-created CS projects in environmental epidemiology. The development of more locally relevant research designs, using local knowledge, obtaining medical ethical clearance, and co-analysing the association between exposure and health, are examples of opportunities and challenges that require epidemiologists to go beyond the traditional research framework and include more outreach activities. Continued efforts, particularly the sharing of information about projects' collaborative processes, are needed to make CS a more concrete and cohesive approach in environmental epidemiology.}

When used to collect wildlife observation data, participatory mapping becomes a type of “geographic citizen science” that involves collaboration with members of the public. While the potential of crowdsourcing to assist in wildlife conservation appears to be large, the quality and validity of the observational data collected remain a key concern. In this study, we examined the quality and validity of spatial data collected in a public participatory mapping project implemented in northern New South Wales (Australia) in 2018 where the public was asked to identify and map the location and frequency of koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) sightings using an internet mapping application. The iconic koala is a nationally-listed threatened species and has wide public recognition, making it an ideal test of our approach to examining the value of citizen science for wildlife. We assessed the validity of koala observation data from two perspectives of validity-as-accuracy (positional accuracy and data completeness) and validity-as-credibility (characteristics of spatial data contributors). To assess validity-as-accuracy, we analysed the distribution of citizen observations of koala sightings compared to an expert-derived probability distribution of koalas (likelihood model). To assess validity-as-credibility, we analysed the survey data to determine which participant characteristics increased the credibility of observational data. We found significant spatial association between crowdsourced koala observations and the likelihood model to validate koala locations, but there was under-reporting in more rural, remote areas. Significant variables contributing to accuracy in koala observations included participant knowledge of koalas, age, length of residence, and formal education. We also compared the crowdsourced results to a field-based citizen science koala observation project implemented in the same region and found crowdsourced participatory mapping provided comparable, if not superior results. Crowdsourced koala observations can augment field-based koala research by covering large geographic areas while engaging a broader public in conservation efforts. However, effective geographic citizen science projects require a significant commitment of resources, including the creation of community partnerships, to obtain high quality spatial data.}

Temporally, public responses tend to peak during the rainstorm period, rather than prior to that. Within a day, behavioural and emotional changes in relation to the rainstorm were most discernable during the morning peak hours. Variations in the response among people of different backgrounds, and the impact of urban flooding on different domains of people's daily life have been revealed.

The article then builds on the foundation of good metadata to describe the components of a spatial data infrastructure and how each part is designed and integrated. The focus for the spatial data infrastructure is discoverability and dissemination of geospatial data. Finally, the article explains how to optimize metadata and spatial data infrastructure strategy for a successful and sustainable system as well as highlights some emerging trends in the geospatial and general information technology fields that will likely impact future use of these concepts.}

abstract = {OpenStreetMap is a geographic information platform designed to provide real-time updates and user-generated content related to its freely available global map, and it is one of the most widely used examples of volunteered geographic information, a technique associated with so-called neogeography. This paper, based on the data from China’s OpenStreetMap road network in May 2014, taking 340 prefecture-level cities in China as its study area, presents the geometric-related (road density) and attribute-related (type diversity) spatial patterns of the OpenStreetMap road network, and explores their relationship. The results are as follows. (1) The distribution of OpenStreetMap road density in Shenzhen, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Macao predominantly obeys a “positive skewness distribution”. OpenStreetMap data for eastern China shows a higher overall and circular structure. In central China, there are noticeable discrepancies in the road density, whereas in western China, the road density is low. (2) The OpenStreetMap road diversity shows a normal distribution. The spatial pattern for the so-called “Hu Huanyong line” was broken by the effect of diplomatic and strategic factors, showing a high diversity along the peripheral border, coastal cities, and core inland cites. (3) China’s OpenStreetMap is partitioned into four parts according to road density and diversity: high density and high diversity; low density and low diversity; high density and low diversity; and low density high diversity. (4) The OpenStreetMap geographical information-collection process and mechanism were analyzed, demonstrating that the road density reflects the preponderance of traffic in the real world. OpenStreetMap road diversity reflects the road-related geographic information demand and value, and it also reflects the interests of users toward to OpenStreetMap geographical information.}

This is mainly due to the fact that Emerging Economies are experiencing increases in traffic, for which their traffic systems are not sufficiently prepared. On one hand, there is a significant demand for data and knowledge to be used for road safety-related decision making. On the other hand, there is a substantial lack of a reliable and detailed knowledge on road casualties in terms of the number of road accidents and fatalities occurring and, on the factors, leading to road accidents or affecting their consequences. When official data are poor or missing these could be integrated with other sources. The objective of this paper is to describe the African Road Safety Observatory (African RSO), a participative web portal developed in the field of the "SaferAfrica – Innovating dialogue and problems appraisal for a safer Africa" project, funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 program. The African RSO combines traditional functions of analyzing and sharing road safety performance data and provide knowledge and information, with the more innovative ones: a Dialogue Platform and the crowdsourcing tool. The Dialogue Platform is dedicated to experts and stakeholders and aims at encouraging and facilitating a constructive engagement and dialogue on road safety in Africa, producing knowledge to inspire road safety funding, policies and interventions in Africa and providing recommendations to update the African Road Safety Action Plan and the African Road Safety Charter. The crowdsourcing tool allows African citizens to report and highlight road safety needs, to share opinions as well as to discuss solutions in their own Countries.}

However, much new technology is designed on an ad hoc basis without considering user needs – especially mobile applications (apps), which often terminate at the proof-of-concept stage. Here, we examine best practice by marshalling learnings from 45 workers representing 20 organisations working globally across the disaster risk management (DRM) lifecycle, including physical and social science, NGOs, technological developers, and (inter)governmental regulatory bodies. We present a series of generalisable and scalable guidelines that are novel in being independent of any specific natural hazard or development setting, designed to maximise the positive societal impact of exploiting mobile technologies. Specifically, the local context, dynamics, and needs must be carefully interrogated a priori, while any product should ideally be co-developed with local stakeholders through a user-centered design approach.}

However, delineating the spatial extent of all RRRs regulated in legislation remains a challenge. Approaches that have been used so far are mainly based on accurate surveying processes, which are untimely and too expensive. Previous studies proposed Volunteered Geographical Information (VGI) as a practical and low-cost method for fast acquisition of spatial data from volunteered contributions, mostly for countries where a limited number of land rights records exist. However, VGI could be beneficial for advanced and developing land administration systems in terms of collecting a range of RRRs which are not spatially well recorded and represented. A multidisciplinary review of the literature on VGI and land administration reveals the lack of a comprehensive conceptual framework for utilising VGI in land administration for the purpose of collecting a range of RRRs related to land and property. This paper investigates the main aspects of utilising VGI in land administration based on qualitative content analysis of available resources. The outcome of this research suggests that using VGI in land administration requires a comprehensive understanding of the complexities and interconnections of legal, institutional, technical and social aspects within each jurisdiction. These findings are merged to formulate a generic and innovative conceptual framework which serves as a basis for the process of collecting land and property RRRs from volunteer contributions.}

abstract = {Until recently, land surveys and digital interpretation of remotely sensed imagery have been used to generate land use inventories. These techniques however, are often cumbersome and costly, allocating large amounts of technical and temporal costs. The technological advances of web 2.0 have brought a wide array of technological achievements, stimulating the participatory role in collaborative and crowd sourced mapping products. This has been fostered by GPS-enabled devices, and accessible tools that enable visual interpretation of high resolution satellite images/air photos provided in collaborative mapping projects. Such technologies offer an integrative approach to geography by means of promoting public participation and allowing accurate assessment and classification of land use as well as geographical features. OpenStreetMap (OSM) has supported the evolution of such techniques, contributing to the existence of a large inventory of spatial land use information. This paper explores the introduction of this novel participatory phenomenon for land use classification in Europe's metropolitan regions. We adopt a positivistic approach to assess comparatively the accuracy of these contributions of OSM for land use classifications in seven large European metropolitan regions. Thematic accuracy and degree of completeness of OSM data was compared to available Global Monitoring for Environment and Security Urban Atlas (GMESUA) datasets for the chosen metropolises. We further extend our findings of land use within a novel framework for geography, justifying that volunteered geographic information (VGI) sources are of great benefit for land use mapping depending on location and degree of VGI dynamism and offer a great alternative to traditional mapping techniques for metropolitan regions throughout Europe. Evaluation of several land use types at the local level suggests that a number of OSM classes (such as anthropogenic land use, agricultural and some natural environment classes) are viable alternatives for land use classification. These classes are highly accurate and can be integrated into planning decisions for stakeholders and policymakers.}

A series of critiques of the technoscientific nature of traditional GIS undergird the formation of critical GIS as a subdiscipline and continues to contribute to its evolving definitions. One notable challenge for any definition of a critical GIS is the continued development of the technologies of GIS itself and the social, political, and economic transformations that reflect and feedback into the continued evolution of technology. Critical GIS is thus dynamic but has rich histories that include critiques and contributions of scholars that mirror and technology studies (STS), feminism and GIS, ontology, research, and participatory GIS (PGIS).}

In particular, cycling safety data from traditional sources are limited since bike crashes are under-reported and there are no central mechanisms for recording near misses. BikeMaps.org is a globally available website for cycling safety VGI, with a focus on spatial analyses of previously unrecorded near misses and collisions. The goal of this paper is to understand how age and gender are related to the use of BikeMaps.org compared to broader ridership and the geographic distribution of incidents for the Capital Regional District (CRD), British Columbia, Canada. Males aged 24–35 reported more incidents than other cohorts, which had similar relative proportions to the regional cycling population in origin-destination survey data. In general, there were higher levels of interaction with the website by younger people (i.e. submitting incidents vs. viewing incidents). Females and people under 35 years of age reported more incidents in central urban areas. People over 35 years of age reported incidents that were more spatially dispersed and covered a broader extent. These findings are indicative of both cycling behaviour and the use of technology. A target group for growth in cycling, females may benefit from improved cycling facilities in city centers. Older people may ride in cities more often if better facilities are provided. Understanding gaps in representation can help target more deliberate campaigns to complete data and inform the effective use of complementary data sources by planners.}

Peer-produced geographic data is gaining a particular importance through increasingly available digital tools and techniques that shape the perception of space in the internet, such as flickr, OpenStreetMap or Wikipedia. However, few studies focused on how space is represented, and by whom it is described. We hypothesize that the alleged opening up of geographic information and the assumed benefits for every individual and society through the occurrence of ‘easy-to-use-mapping-tools’ was premature. To explore these assumptions, a comparative study of the flickr worldmap was undertaken and roughly 6.8million metadatasets of geocoded photos in France, and roughly 50,000 metadatasets in Afghanistan were downloaded and the metadata was analyzed. Our results indicate that photos geocoded in France show a large diversity of motives, while photos geocoded in Afghanistan are mostly limited to content containing warfare when they are up loaded in English. The content of the photo and therefore the representation of space strongly depend on who uploaded the photo, particularly in Afghanistan. We can show that the representation of space on the internet, for the case of flickr, is strongly dominated by perceptions of Western societies and individuals. We therefore confirm our hypothesis that the supposed opening up of geographic information systems through ‘easy-to-use-mapping-tools’ and their democratization thereof was premature. Moreover, we highlight the importance of understanding who contributes online content to be able to evaluate peer-produced data, its value, and its possible applications to avoid reproducing biases.}

Map generalization in the context of automated mapping is a set of techniques for automatically deriving topographic and thematic maps at smaller scales, from detailed, large-scale maps. Developments in model generalization are in response to the need to select and manage large volumes of data while cartographic generalization is a set of techniques concerned with the optimal arrangement and symbolization of geographic data. There now exists a diverse range of map generalization algorithms. Importantly there is an increasing realization of the importance of automated evaluation techniques in order to develop fully automated solutions—i.e., systems that require no human intervention. Map generalization techniques are also highly relevant to social media mapping, particularly in the context of mobile technologies. Given the ever widening diversity of data sources, it is important to reflect on the importance of map generalization techniques in data fusion and the importance of modeling quality control among heterogenous global datasets that vary in space and time.}

Using these, we illustrate how urban models can be limiting as a predictive tool but useful as an assessment mechanism, especially when additional considerations of scale and institutional roles are applied. We compare the outcomes for the overlapping geographic area between the two planning agencies and find considerable variations in the location and amount of growth and discuss why and how the differences in the spatial extents affect the model results. Through a discussion on the implications for modelers and planners, especially in light of the ongoing initiatives in India, we highlight the value of consideration of multiple model outcomes and highlight the importance of coordination of planning efforts taking place in spatially overlapping or nested jurisdictions.}

This study focused on characterization of EaRs, in which items are spatially displayed and impacted by natural events. Several methods can assess these EaRs through expert or engineering approaches. Among the expert approaches, the multicriteria method is more flexible and allows integration of a wide range of information in order to characterize and discretize different EaRs. Traditionally, the mapping and criteria accuracy of EaRs is the same at all spatial analysis scales, while the hazard accuracy changes according to the spatial scales. Therefore, we propose an approach based on the selection of different information/criteria among several private or open access multiple geographical databases to adapt the mapping and criteria accuracy of each EaR according to the hazard analysis spatial scale. After harmonizing the different databases and merging them under GIS, a single database per work scale is created through a specific procedure with interoperability of results between scales. Thus, the number of criteria used to describe these EaRs will depend on the scale of work and the spatial scale of the analysis. To develop and test the transposability of this method, three experimental coastal study sites subject to several hazards (multirisk) have been selected in Normandy (France) with error estimations ranging between 10% and 20%. Subsequently, these data can be integrated into risk and multirisk analyses.}

abstract = {The management of multiple-use public lands such as national forests in the U.S. is controversial because of the wide range of potential uses and contested public values for these lands. Previous research on national forest values and management preferences examined these relationships non-spatially. The development of public participation GIS (PPGIS) and volunteered geographic information (VGI) systems provide new opportunities to assess spatial relationships between perceived national forest values and preferred uses. This research used empirical data collected from a PPGIS/VGI study for three national forests in California to examine spatial and non-spatial relationships between place-based forest values and preferred uses. The relationships suggest public participants translated some of their non-spatial forest values and preferences into behavioral choices when mapping place-specific values and preferred uses. The empirical relationships between place-based forest values and uses were generally consistent with previous survey research results. Positive, non-spatial attitudes toward extractive uses of national forests were correlated with participant mapping of economic values and related extractive uses, while nonmaterial forest attitudes were correlated with participant mapping of amenity values and conservation-related uses. Further, spatial preferences for extractive forest uses such as timber harvesting were mapped proximate to economic values, while nonmaterial spatial preferences were mapped proximate to amenity-related forest values. PPGIS offers the potential to translate philosophical and ideology-based national forest preferences into place-specific discourse about forest management activities where public accommodation may be more achievable.}

The main challenge with using these data for LULC classification was their high level of noise, as the Landsat images all contained varying degrees of cloud cover (causes of attribute noise) and the OSM polygons contained locational errors and class labeling errors (causes of class noise). A second challenge arose from the imbalanced class distribution in the extracted training data, which occurred due to wide discrepancies in the area coverage of each OSM-LU/OSM-N class. To address the first challenge, three relatively noise-tolerant algorithms – naïve bayes (NB), decision tree (C4.5 algorithm), and random forest (RF) – were evaluated for image classification. To address the second challenge, artificial training samples were generated for the minority classes using the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE). Image classification accuracies were calculated for a four-class, five-class, and six-class LULC system to assess the capability of the proposed methods for mapping relatively broad as well as more detailed LULC types, and the highest overall accuracies achieved were 84.0% (four-class SMOTE-RF result), 81.0% (five-class SMOTE-RF result), and 72.0% (six-class SMOTE-NB result). RF and NB had relatively similar overall accuracies, while those of C4.5 were much lower. SMOTE led to higher classification accuracies for RF and C4.5, and in some cases for NB, despite the noise in the training set. The main advantages of the proposed methods are their cost- and time-efficiency, as training data for supervised classification is automatically extracted from the crowdsourced datasets and no pre-processing for cloud detection/cloud removal is performed.}

abstract = {Monitoring of changes is one of the most important inherent capabilities of remote sensing. The steadily increasing amount of available very-high resolution (VHR) remote sensing imagery requires highly automatic methods and thus, largely unsupervised concepts for change detection. In addition, new procedures that address this challenge should be capable of handling remote sensing data acquired by different sensors. Thereby, especially in rapidly changing complex urban environments, the high level of detail present in VHR data indicates the deployment of object-based concepts for change detection. This paper presents a novel object-based approach for unsupervised change detection with focus on individual buildings. First, a principal component analysis together with a unique procedure for determination of the number of relevant principal components is performed as a predecessor for change detection. Second, k-means clustering is applied for discrimination of changed and unchanged buildings. In this manner, several groups of object-based difference features that can be derived from multi-temporal VHR data are evaluated regarding their discriminative properties for change detection. In addition, the influence of deviating viewing geometries when using VHR data acquired by different sensors is quantified. Overall, the proposed workflow returned viable results in the order of κ statistics of 0.8–0.9 and beyond for different groups of features, which demonstrates its suitability for unsupervised change detection in dynamic urban environments. With respect to imagery from different sensors, deviating viewing geometries were found to deteriorate the change detection result only slightly in the order of up to 0.04 according to κ statistics, which underlines the robustness of the proposed approach.}

In theory, BBB is a desirable goal, but numerous experiences have proved that it is quite challenging to implement in practice. Additional research on BBB is needed to contribute to its successful implementation.}

In recent years the research community has experienced a strong increase in studies related to routing applications tailored to disabled people in which the lack of a sophisticated dataset played a major role. This study proposes an algorithm for the generation of a disabled people friendly routing network, based on collaboratively collected geodata provided by the OpenStreetMap (OSM) project. This new representation of a routing graph can be used in numerous applications and maps dedicated to people with disabilities. The algorithm is tested and evaluated for selected areas in Europe, resulting in newly generated extended networks that include sidewalk information. The results have shown that the success of the final implementation of the introduced algorithm depends highly on the attribute quality of the OSM dataset.}

abstract = {Global data on settlements, built-up land and population distributions are becoming increasingly available and represent important inputs to a better understanding of key demographic processes such as urbanization and interactions between human and natural systems over time. One persistent drawback that prevents user communities from effectively and objectively using these data products more broadly, is the absence of thorough and transparent validation studies. This study develops a validation framework for accuracy assessment of multi-temporal built-up land layers using integrated public parcel and building records as validation data. The framework is based on measures derived from confusion matrices and incorporates a sensitivity analysis for potential spatial offsets between validation and test data as well as tests for the effects of varying criteria of the abstract term built-up land on accuracy measures. Furthermore, the framework allows for accuracy assessments by strata of built-up density, which provides important insights on the relationship between classification accuracy and development intensity to better instruct and educate user communities on quality aspects that might be relevant to different purposes. We use data from the newly-released Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL), for four epochs since 1975 and at fine spatial resolution (38m), in the United States for a demonstration of the framework. The results show very encouraging accuracy measures that vary across study areas, generally improve over time but show very distinct patterns across the rural-urban trajectories. Areas of higher development intensity are very accurately classified and highly reliable. Rural areas show low degrees of accuracy, which could be affected by misalignment between the reference data and the data under test in areas where built-up land is scattered and rare. However, a regression analysis, which examines how well GHSL can estimate built-up land using spatially aggregated analytical units, indicates that classification error is mainly of thematic nature. Thus, caution should be taken in using the data product in rural regions. The results can be useful in further improving classification procedures to create measures of the built environment. The validation framework can be extended to data-poor regions of the world using map data and Volunteered Geographic Information.}

Current traffic information services employ participatory sensing and crowd sourcing techniques to provide dynamic traffic information consisting of estimated travel times and congestion warnings. In this paper we propose the crowd sensing system based on smartphones and integrated GPS and accelerometer sensors, to capture dynamic, short-lasting traffic events and drivers’ aggressive and risky behavior like excessive breaking, sudden lane change, open turns, speed excess and route deviations. These traffic events can be categorized as risky driving situations or near accidents and are typically not included in any official traffic statistics. The system uses crowd intelligence based on participatory sensing paradigm and collaborative mechanisms to detect important traffic events/situations. It provides proactive notification and recommendations to drivers in the vicinity of, or on the route to reported events. The proposed crowd sensing system ensures information reliability through space–time clustering of reported events/situations while preserving drivers’ privacy. We perform the evaluation of our system that demonstrates the effectiveness and usefulness of advanced navigation service based on it, that uses collected dynamic traffic events to provide warning and notifications to drivers and safest route navigation. This novel functionality of a navigation service enhances drivers’ situational awareness, increasing safety and effectiveness of the traffic.}

abstract = {Urban green space (UGS) is an indispensable component of urban environmental systems and is important to urban residents. Both physical features (e.g., shrubs, trees) and social functions (e.g., public parks, green buffers) are important in UGS mapping. Most UGS studies rely solely on remote sensing data to conduct UGS mapping of physical features, and few studies have focused on UGS mapping from a social function perspective. Due to the limitations of remote sensing in identifying social features; social sensing, which can reflect socioeconomic characteristics, is needed. As a result, a novel methodological framework for integrating these two different data sources to conduct the social functional mapping of UGS has been required. Consequently, we first extracted vegetation patches from an area in Beijing, via the Hyperplanes for Plant Extraction Methodology (HPEM) and considered the parcels segmented by the OpenStreetMap (OSM) road networks as the basic analytical units. Then, near-convex-hull analysis (NCHA) and text-concave-hull analysis (TCHA) were performed to integrate the multi-source data. The results show that the Level I and Level II (refer to Table 3) social function types of UGS had overall accuracies of 92.48% and 88.76%, respectively. Our study provides an improved understanding of UGS and can assist government departments in urban planning. It can also help researchers broaden their research scope by acting as a freely available data source for their work.}

Many new forms of open and free to access geo-located data are available, and as yet little research has evaluated the use of these data in areal interpolation. This study evaluates the effectiveness of household data as ancillary information from two sources: formal census household counts and informal data on residential (house) sales from commercial websites, applied to 2 case studies with different contexts - Leeds in UK and Qingdao in China. The proposed Household Proportion method uses household counts as ancillary information for areal interpolation of population. It is compared with other interpolation and the results show that HP method yields significantly better results than other interpolation approaches using ancillary data, with lower errors. This research also demonstrates that such data support the application of a suite of interpolation methods that make fewer assumptions about underlying spatial processes. The need to examine issues of representativeness and data coverage are identified and discussed, but the study demonstrates the opportunities for including freely available geo-located data to inform geographic analyses.}

Financial inclusion has been identified as a priority by multiple agencies in the region and on-the-ground efforts are currently underway to identify previously unknown financial access points in numerous developing African countries. Existing techniques for estimating the location of these access points rely on spatial analysis of often outdated or unsuitable publicly available datasets such as population density, road networks, etc., as well as expensive and time consuming surveys of locals in the region. In this work we propose an approach to augment existing spatial data analysis techniques through the inclusion of user-generated geo-content and geo-social media data. Through a comparison of standard regression models and machine learning techniques, this work proposes the use of alternative data sources to build prediction models for identifying financial access locations in countries where current estimation models are insufficient. With a better understanding of geospatial distribution patterns this work aims at reducing data acquisition costs and providing decision makers with critical data more quickly and efficiently. Finally, we present a mobile application built on the outcomes of this analysis that is currently being used to better inform on-the-ground data collection efforts.}

The literature testifies to a very rapid growth in the field, with Twitter (52 studies) and Flickr (34 studies) being most frequently used as data sources. A growing number of studies combine data from multiple sites and jointly investigates multiple types of media. A broader, more qualitative review of the insights provided by the investigated studies suggests that while social media data offer unprecedented opportunities in terms of data volume, scale of analysis, and real-time monitoring, researchers are only starting to cope with the challenges of data’s heterogeneity and noise levels, potential biases, ethics of data acquisition and use, and uncertainty about future data availability. Critical areas for the development of the field include integration of different types of information in data mashups, development of quality assurance procedures and ethical codes, improved integration with existing methods, and assurance of long-term, free and easy-to-access provision of public social media data for future environmental researchers.}

Three hypotheses are formulated and tested with three PSL models to understand the effects of different attributes on scenic route selection.

We selected randomly eight traffic sites (disturbed sites) and eight adjacent control sites (undisturbed sites). Plant cover and composition were assessed with the point-intercept method and phytosociological census. In each site, we collected soil samples to assess soil physicochemical properties, including apparent specific weight (ASG), actual specific weight (RSG), porosity, texture, electric conductivity (EC) and pH. Soil compaction was measured at 30 spaces points per site. Plant cover and richness was significant lower in disturbed sites, with only four species present in areas subjected to disturbance. There were also changes in species dominance, with native perennial shrubs and grasses characterizing the undisturbed sites while the disturbed sites were mainly dominated by the invasive exotic herb Salsola kali. ORVs traffic also affected soil physicochemical properties including soil compaction, ASG, EC and soil pH. Soil compaction was more than double in disturbed sites and ASG tended to be higher under this condition. The EC was significantly higher and soil pH was significantly lower in the disturbed sites. Reduced vegetation cover and changes to soils physicochemical properties on quadbike trails highlights the impacts of ORVs in the landscape and the need to develop management strategies to minimize disturbance from ORVs on vegetation and soils.}

abstract = {Rapid worldwide urbanization benefits humans in many aspects, but the prevalence of common psychiatric disorders is increased in urban populations. While the impact of city living and urban upbringing on mental health is well established, it remains elusive which of the multiple factors of urban living convey risk and resilience for mental disorders. For example, air pollutants, traffic noises and fragmented social networks are some of the highly interdependent and complex influences of city living suggested to be detrimental for mental health. In contrast, urban green spaces, social contacts and physical activity have been associated with increased well-being. Knowledge on underlying mechanisms of these associations is crucial for both city planning and healthcare as it informs on how to build environments and to intervene in a way that fosters mental health yet reduces psychiatric disorders. Thus, real-life studies in urban contexts have been launched making use of recent methodological advancements: Mobile devices (e.g. smartphones) to gather intensive longitudinal mental health data, stationary sensor output providing specific context information (e.g. on weather conditions and air pollution), combinations with traditional and modern neuroimaging techniques (e.g. functional near-infrared spectroscopy and portable magnetic-encephalogram caps) and modern virtual reality setups allowing for increasingly realistic and ecological valid simulation of complex urban environments. Here we review selected methodological developments, state-of-the-art approaches as well as technological frontiers and provide examples for their application, highlighting promising potential of these novel methods for tackling the urgent urbanicity societal issue of the 21st century with a view to improve urban contexts conducive to mental health.}

In this paper, we developed a prototype national-scale Twitter data mining pipeline for improved stakeholder situational awareness during flooding events across Great Britain, by retrieving relevant social geodata, grounded in environmental data sources (flood warnings and river levels). With potential users we identified and addressed three research questions to develop this application, whose components constitute a modular architecture for real-time dashboards. First, polling national flood warning and river level Web data sources to obtain at-risk locations. Secondly, real-time retrieval of geotagged tweets, proximate to at-risk areas. Thirdly, filtering flood-relevant tweets with natural language processing and machine learning libraries, using word embeddings of tweets. We demonstrated the national-scale social geodata pipeline using over 420,000 georeferenced tweets obtained between 20 and 29th June 2016.}

A number of different remotely-sensed global land cover products are available but studies have shown that there are large spatial discrepancies between these different products when compared. To address this issue of land cover uncertainty, a tool called Geo-Wiki was developed, which integrates online and mobile applications, high resolution satellite imagery available from Google Earth, and data collection through crowdsourcing as a mechanism for validating and improving globally relevant spatial information on land cover and land use. Through its growing network of volunteers and a number of successful data collection campaigns, almost 5 million samples of land cover and land use have been collected at many locations around the globe. This paper provides an overview of the main features of Geo-Wiki, and then using a series of examples, illustrates how the crowdsourced data collected through Geo-Wiki have been used to improve information on land cover and land use.}

This paper examines an explicitly geographical aspect of Web 2.0 with respect to these debates: the geospatial web, or ‘geoweb’. As part of fundamental shifts in the kinds of geographic information available, its circulation, and representative forms it assumes, the geoweb implies new objects of privacy concern and subsequent privacy-related negotiations over the aggregate of its component information, technologies, and data praxes. Thus we argue that privacy must not only be revisited, but indeed re-conceptualized. Whereas prior research on privacy vis-à-vis geographic information technologies has tended to question what privacy ‘is’, we focus instead on the constitutive outcomes of societal struggles over privacy. We examine how privacy is being negotiated around two geoweb services – Google Street View and the Twitter GeoAPI – to illustrate that these contestations produce privacy as a social object in particular ways. We show that public discourse around actual or anticipated privacy harms stemming from geoweb services and their uses, as well as the preventatives and remedies proposed or implemented to address such harms, reconstitute the objects and practices of privacy concern, and alter the roles and relationships of state, civil and corporate actors in the construction of privacy. Finally we suggest that the geoweb raises new privacy concerns because some of its representational forms – namely geo-tagged images and self-authored texts – facilitate identification and disclosure with more immediacy and less abstraction.}

AimTo investigate how recreational walking and transportation walking are associated with the natural and built environmental characteristics of the living environment in the Netherlands, and examine the differences in their associations between weekdays and weekends. Method and data We extracted the total duration of daily walking (in minutes per person) for recreation and transportation of adults aged 18 years and above from the Dutch National Travel Survey 2015–2017 (N = 65,785) and analyzed it as an outcome variable. Objective measures of the natural (i.e., normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), blue space and meteorological conditions) and built environment (i.e., crossing density, land-use mix, and residential building density) around respondents' home addresses were determined for buffers with 300, 600, and 1000 m radii using a geographic information system. To assess associations between recreational and transportation walking and the environmental exposures separately, we fitted Tobit regression models to the walking data, adjusted for multiple confounders. ResultsOn weekdays, people living in areas with less NDVI, higher land-use mix, and higher crossing density were more likely to engage in transportation walking. Recreational walking was negatively associated with NDVI, blue space, crossing density, precipitation and daily average temperature. At weekends, land-use mix supports both recreational and transportation walking. A negative association appeared for NDVI and transportation walking. Daily average rainfall and temperature were inversely correlated with recreational walking. Sensitivity tests indicated that some associations depend on the buffer size. ConclusionsOur findings suggest that the built and natural environments are differently associated with people's recreational and transportation walking. We also found differences in the walking-environment associations between weekdays and weekends. Place-based policies to design walking-friendly neighborhoods may have different implications for different types of walking.}

Unbalanced development theories have been used to interpret population migration; conversely, population migration patterns can also reflect unbalanced regional development. Inspired by the growth pole and pole-axis theories, we infer that a rich-club phenomenon in internal migration caused by unbalanced regional development exists. We propose a progressive methodological framework combining complex network science and geographic information science applied to Chinese Chunyun migration to empirically research this potential rich-club phenomenon in an intercity population migration network and investigate the functions of prominent cities in intra/interregional migration. We use the global rich-club coefficient to examine whether the rich-club phenomenon exists in the population migration network. Then, the community detection method and assortativity coefficient are applied to further understand the connections between cities. Finally, the influence and functions of prominent cities are explored from multiple perspectives and scales. The results indicate that the rich-club phenomenon existed in intercity migration during the Chinese Chunyun period and presents the positive role of rich-club cities in intra/interregional migration. An imbalance in urban and regional development is also found. This paper can be used to guide urban planning, transportation planning, and population research.}

Second, the effort of the user for this test is used to generate additional information, e.g., digitization of books or identification of house numbers. In this work, we present a concept for adapting the reCAPTCHA idea to create user-generated geographic information from earth observation data, and the requirements during the conception and implementation are depicted in detail. Furthermore, the essential parts of a Geo-reCAPTCHA system are described, and afterwards transferred, to a prototype implementation. An empirical user study is conducted to investigate the Geo-reCAPTCHA approach, assessing time and quality of the resulting geographic information. Our results show that a Geo-reCAPTCHA can be solved by the users of our study on building digitization in a short amount of time (19.2s on average) with an overall average accuracy of the digitizations of 82.2%. In conclusion, Geo-reCAPTCHA has the potential to be a reasonable alternative to the typical reCAPTCHA, and to become a new data-rich channel of crowdsourced geographic information.}

Limited hydrometric datasets and the pressure on long-term hydrological monitoring networks make it paramount to explore alternative methods for data collection. This is particularly the case for low-income countries, where data scarcity is more pronounced, and where conventional monitoring methods are expensive and logistically challenging. Citizen science in hydrological research has recently gained popularity and crowdsourced monitoring is a promising cost-effective approach for data collection. Citizen science also has the potential to enhance knowledge co-creation and science-based evidence that underpins the governance and management of water resources. This paper provides a comprehensive review on citizen science and crowdsourced data collection within the context of hydrology, based on a synthesis of 71 articles from 2001 to 2018. Application of citizen science in hydrology is increasing in number and breadth, generating a plethora of scientific data. Citizen science approaches differ in scale, scope and degree of citizen involvement. Most of the programs are found in North America and Europe. Participation mostly comprises a contributory citizen science model, which engages citizens in data collection. In order to leverage the full potential of citizen science in knowledge co-generation, future citizen science projects in hydrology could benefit from more co-created types of projects that establish strong ties between research and public engagement, thereby enhancing the long-term sustainability of monitoring networks.}

However, building-level adaptation measures such as floodproofing or building elevation are often evaluated at aggregated spatial scales, which may result in sub-optimal investment decisions. In this paper, we develop a flood risk model and combine it with a micro-scale CBA at the building level to obtain an optimal mix of adaptation measures per area. We apply this approach to Venice Beach in Los Angeles and Naples in Long Beach. We subsequently compare our results with the conventional, spatially aggregated area-based CBA approach. Our findings show that a mix of 35%–45% dry-floodproofing measures and 55%–65% building elevation measures is optimal. Elevation works best in areas with high inundation depths, while dry-floodproofing is preferable in areas with shallow inundation depths. The optimal mix of measures derived from our micro-scale approach results in an economic efficiency up to 85% higher than that yielded by the commonly applied spatially aggregated approach. We therefore recommend that economic evaluations of building-level adaptation measures are conducted at the smallest possible scale, or that CBAs are performed on disaggregated areas based on inundation depth.}

In order to achieve this, a Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) dataset was used, the OpenStreetMap (OSM) project. To test the developed model, a total of 8550 accidents with fatal or non-fatal injuries that occurred in the City of Zagreb from 2010 to 2014 were evaluated. Traffic accident data was collected using the pen-and-paper method while the traffic accident locations were determined using Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers embedded within police vehicles. This form of data entry invariably introduces errors in both geometric and contextual attributes. To fully counteract these errors, the developed model consists of two key concepts: the Jaro–Winkler string matching technique and the Inverse Distance Weighting method. Over 66% of traffic accident locations were validated, which is an increase of 15% when compared to the classical approach. The model outlined in this paper shows a significant improvement in estimating the correct location of traffic accidents. This in turn results in a drastic decrease in resources needed to estimate the quality of accident locations.}

Authoritative global reference data are generally collected by experts with regional knowledge through photo-interpretation. During the last decade, crowdsourcing has emerged as an attractive alternative for rapid and relatively cheap data collection, beckoning the increasingly relevant question: can these two data sources be combined to validate thematic maps? In this article, we compared expert and crowd data and assessed their relative agreement for cropland identification, a land cover class often reported as difficult to map. Results indicate that observations from experts and volunteers could be partially conflated provided that several consistency checks are performed. We propose that conflation, i.e., replacement and augmentation of expert observations by crowdsourced observations, should be carried out both at the sampling and data analytics levels. The latter allows to evaluate the reliability of crowdsourced observations and to decide whether they should be conflated or discarded. We demonstrate that the standard deviation of crowdsourced contributions is a simple yet robust indicator of reliability which can effectively inform conflation. Following this criterion, we found that 70% of the expert observations could be crowdsourced with little to no effect on accuracy estimates, allowing a strategic reallocation of the spared expert effort to increase the reliability of the remaining 30% at no additional cost. Finally, we provide a collection of evidence-based recommendations for future hybrid reference data collection campaigns.}

In assessing more than 56,000 publications, we identified just 91 LCA studies that integrate biotic ecosystem services in a meaningful way. We further classified these papers based on an ecosystem service standardization system – the Common International Classification for Ecosystem Services (CICES) – and the use of LCA midpoints and endpoints. LCA research has focused on a relatively small number of regulation and maintenance ecosystem services (especially carbon balance), with far less emphasis on provisioning services. Research on cultural services is especially scarce. Land use is a particularly promising area for integrative ecosystem services–LCA research but will require more sophisticated accounting of geographic and temporal variation, as well as the dynamic exchanges of flows between regions. We conclude by illustrating how Geographic Information Science (GIScience) can help address these challenges, enabling much deeper and wider integration of ecosystem service accounting in the LCA field.}

abstract = {This paper investigates the usability of Future Internet technologies (aka “Generic Enablers of the Future Internet”) in the context of environmental applications. The paper incorporates the best aspects of the state-of-the-art in environmental informatics with geospatial solutions and scalable processing capabilities of Internet-based tools. It specifically targets the promotion of the “Environmental Observation Web” as an observation-centric paradigm for building the next generation of environmental applications. In the Environmental Observation Web, the great majority of data are considered as observations. These can be generated from sensors (hardware), numerical simulations (models), as well as by humans (human sensors). Independently from the observation provenance and application scope, data can be represented and processed in a standardised way in order to understand environmental processes and their interdependencies. The development of cross-domain applications is then leveraged by technologies such as Cloud Computing, Internet of Things, Big Data Processing and Analytics. For example, “the cloud” can satisfy the peak-performance needs of applications which may occasionally use large amounts of processing power at a fraction of the price of a dedicated server farm. The paper also addresses the need for Specific Enablers that connect mainstream Future Internet capabilities with sensor and geospatial technologies. Main categories of such Specific Enablers are described with an overall architectural approach for developing environmental applications and exemplar use cases.}

abstract = {Voluminous geographic data have been, and continue to be, collected with modern data acquisition techniques such as global positioning systems (GPS), high-resolution remote sensing, location-aware services and surveys, and internet-based volunteered geographic information. There is an urgent need for effective and efficient methods to extract unknown and unexpected information from spatial data sets of unprecedentedly large size, high dimensionality, and complexity. To address these challenges, spatial data mining and geographic knowledge discovery has emerged as an active research field, focusing on the development of theory, methodology, and practice for the extraction of useful information and knowledge from massive and complex spatial databases. This paper highlights recent theoretical and applied research in spatial data mining and knowledge discovery. We first briefly review the literature on several common spatial data-mining tasks, including spatial classification and prediction; spatial association rule mining; spatial cluster analysis; and geovisualization. The articles included in this special issue contribute to spatial data mining research by developing new techniques for point pattern analysis, prediction in space–time data, and analysis of moving object data, as well as by demonstrating applications of genetic algorithms for optimization in the context of image classification and spatial interpolation. The papers concludes with some thoughts on the contribution of spatial data mining and geographic knowledge discovery to geographic information sciences.}

This study evaluates the effectiveness of geo-located night-time tweets data as ancillary information and its combination with the three commonly used ancillary datasets in intelligent areal interpolation. Due to the skewed Twitter user age, the other purpose of this study is to test the effect of age bias control data on estimation of different age group populations. Results suggest that geo-located tweets as single control data does not perform as well as the three other control layers for total population and all age-specific population groups. However, the noticeable enhancement effect of Twitter data on other control data, especially for age groups with a high percentage of Twitter users, suggests that it helps to better reflect population distribution by increasing variation in densities within a residential area delineated by other control data.}

Although an Israeli narrative has largely dominated the ‘cartographic battlefield’, the latest chapter of this story has not been written yet: collaborative forms of web 2.0 cartographies have restructured power relations in mapping practices and challenged traditional monopolies on map and spatial data production. Thus, we can expect web 2.0 cartographies to be a ‘game changer’ for cartography in Palestine and Israel. In this paper, I review this assumption with the popular example of OpenStreetMap (OSM). Following a mixed methods approach, I comparatively analyze the genesis of OSM in Israel and Palestine. Although nationalist motives do not play a significant role on either side, it turns out that the project is dominated by Israeli and international mappers, whereas Palestinians have hardly contributed to OSM. As a result, social fragmentations and imbalances between Israel and Palestine are largely reproduced through OSM data. Discussing the low involvement of Palestinians, I argue that OSM's ground truth paradigm might be a watershed for participation. Presumably, the project's data are less meaningful in some local contexts than in others. Moreover, the seemingly apolitical approach to map only ‘facts on the ground’ reaffirms present spatio-social order and thus the power relations behind it. Within a Palestinian narrative, however, many aspects of the factual material space might appear not as neutral physical objects but as results of suppression, in which case, any ‘accurate’ spatial representation, such as OSM, becomes objectionable.}

abstract = {Land cover change (LCC) can have a significant impact on human and environmental well-being. LCC maps derived from historical remote sensing (RS) images are often used to evaluate the impacts of past LC changes and to construct models to predict future LC changes. Free moderate spatial resolution (~30m) optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) RS imagery is now becoming increasingly available for this LCC monitoring. However, the classification algorithms used to extract LC information from these images typically require “training data” for classification (i.e. points or polygons with LC class labels), and acquiring this labelled training data can be difficult and time-consuming. Alternatively, crowdsourced geographic data (CGD) has become widely available from online sources like OpenStreetMap (OSM), and it may provide a useful source of training data for LCC monitoring. A major challenge with utilizing CGD for LCC mapping, however, is the presence of class labelling errors, and these errors can vary spatially (e.g. due to differing levels of CGD contributor expertise) and temporally (e.g. due to time lag between CGD creation and RS imagery acquisition). In this study, we investigated a new LCC mapping method which utilizes free Landsat (optical) and PALSAR mosaic (SAR) satellite imagery in combination with labelled LC data extracted from CGD sources (the OSM “landuse” and “natural” polygon datasets). A semi-unsupervised classification approach was employed for the LCC mapping to reduce the effects of class label noise in the CGD. The main motivation and benefit of the proposed method is that it does not require training data to be manually collected, allowing for a faster and more automated assessment of LCC. As a case study, we applied the method to map LCC in the Laguna de Bay area of the Philippines over the 2007–2015 period. The LCC map produced using our proposed approach achieved an overall classification accuracy of 90.2%, providing evidence that CGD and multi-temporal/multi-sensor satellite imagery, when combined, have a great potential for LCC monitoring.}

In this paper we investigated the impact of PV on land use in the area with the highest density of PV farms in Italy, i.e. the Province of Lecce (Southeastern Italy): here, such impact is expected to be maximum and has been the subject of public debate. In order to map all PV farms in detail, we used participative cartography, specifically OpenStreetMap (OSM), as data source. This international project collects geographic information (often gathered by people – i.e. the so-called Volunteered Geographic Information, VGI – using widely available technologies, such as smartphone built-in GPS), in order to create freely available global topographic maps. In this paper, we used the OSM platform to create a Geographical Information System (GIS) of PV farms in the Province of Lecce. Using GIS-based techniques, we estimated land use at the municipality level and created a density map of PV farms within the study area. Using the official land cover map Corine Land Cover of 2012, we also evaluated the main changes in land use. The results highlight the correlation between spatial distribution of PV farms and geographic variables (geomorphology, demographics, tourism, etc). We also show that land take by PV farms is quite marginal even in a region such as the Province of Lecce, where the density of PV installed power is among the highest available at the global level.}

It is traditionally performed with field surveys or manual photo interpretation, two practices that are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Therefore, we aim to automate landuse mapping at the urban-object level with a deep learning approach based on data from multiple sources (or modalities). We consider two image modalities: overhead imagery from Google Maps and ensembles of ground-based pictures (side-views) per urban-object from Google Street View (GSV). These modalities bring complementary visual information pertaining to the urban-objects. We propose an end-to-end trainable model, which uses OpenStreetMap annotations as labels. The model can accommodate a variable number of GSV pictures for the ground-based branch and can also function in the absence of ground pictures at prediction time. We test the effectiveness of our model over the area of Île-de-France, France, and test its generalization abilities on a set of urban-objects from the city of Nantes, France. Our proposed multimodal Convolutional Neural Network achieves considerably higher accuracies than methods that use a single image modality, making it suitable for automatic landuse map updates. Additionally, our approach could be easily scaled to multiple cities, because it is based on data sources available for many cities worldwide.}

Without question, reporting of its impact has been bolstered in large part through near real-time daily mapping of cases and fatalities. Though these maps serve as an effective political and social tool in communicating disease impact, most visualizations largely over-emphasize their usefulness for tracking disease progression and appropriate responses. Messy and inconsistent health data are a big part of this problem, as is a paucity of high-resolution spatial data to monitor health outcomes. Another issue is that the ease of producing out-of-the box products largely out paces the response to the core challenges inherent in the poor quality of most geo-referenced data. Adopting a GIScience approach, and in particular, making use of location-based intelligence tools, can improve the shortcomings in data reporting and more accurately reveal how COVID-19 will have a long-term impact on global health.}

Since little feedback on similar initiatives is available, we introduce three recent citizen science projects which have been launched independently by research organisations to quantitatively document flood flows in catchments and urban areas of Argentina, France, and New Zealand. Key drivers for success appear to be: a clear and simple procedure, suitable tools for data collecting and processing, an efficient communication plan, the support of local stakeholders, and the public awareness of natural hazards.}

The remote sensing database was prepared as a result of a semi-automatic classification, dividing the land cover data into urban and non-urban classes. The second data set details an alternative view of the phenomena of urbanization by concentrating on illegal settlements in the conservation zone. It was based on voluntary complaints about environmental and land use offences filed at the Procuraduria Ambiental y del Ordenamiento Territorial del Distrito Federal (PAOT), which is a governmental entity responsible for reviewing and processing grievances on five basic topics: illegal land use, deterioration of green areas, waste, noise/vibrations, and animals. Anyone can file a PAOT complaint by phone, electronically, or in person. The complaint ends with a resolution, act of conciliation, or recommendation for action by other actors, such as the police or health office.

However, many of the world's reefs are declining, with Caribbean reefs suffering a significant decline in living corals over the past half century. This situation emphasizes the need to assess and monitor reef conditions using a variety of methods. In this study, a new method for assessing reef conditions to inform management using participatory mapping by coral reef “experts” in the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI) is described. Occupational SCUBA divers were recruited (n=87) to map coral reef conditions, uses, and threats (stressors) using an internet-based mapping website. The data reveal an uneven geographic distribution of reef conditions in the USVI with the most frequently mapped perceived healthy reef characteristics being: large amount of physical reef structure (n=872 markers); endangered or threatened species present (n=721); and large amount of live coral cover (n=615). The greatest perceived threats were: invasive species (n=606); water pollution (n=234); and unsustainable fishing (n=200). Areas of important reef characteristics, perceived threats to reefs, and perceived recovery potential were plotted to identify areas requiring critical management attention. The authors found that perceptions of healthy reef conditions outnumbered perceptions of reef threats for nine of the ten most familiar coral reefs; the most frequent activity type within the coral reefs was tourism diving; and for the most familiar coral reefs, the divers perceived a high recovery potential. Given the novelty of participatory mapping methods to assess coral reefs, the strengths and weaknesses of the method is evaluated. The authors further propose a management typology for categorizing reef areas to inform their future management. In the absence of primary data, or, as a supplement to underwater surveys and remotely-sensed data on reef condition, participatory mapping can provide a cost-effective means for assessing coral reef conditions while identifying place-specific reef locations requiring management attention.}

Though traditionally there have always been transactional elements between government and citizen, for example payment of taxes in exchange for services, or voting in exchange for representation, the rise of modern smartphone and smart city technologies have further enabled micro-transactions between citizen, government, and information broker. We conceptualize how the modern smart city, as both envisaged and enacted, incorporates the citizen not necessarily as a whole actor, but as a series of micro-transactions encoded on the real-time landscape of the city. This transactional citizen becomes counted by smart city sensors and integrated into smart city decision-making through the use of certain preferred platforms. To approach this shift from traditional forms of citizen/city interaction towards micro-transactions, we conceptualize four broad modes of transaction; type (intentional contribution), tweet (intermediated by third party), tap (convened or requested transaction), and pass (ambient transaction based on movement). These four modes are used to frame critical questions of how citizens interact with government in the emerging age of the smart city, and how these interactions impact the relationship between citizen and government, introducing new avenues for private sector influence.}

Despite doubts about its validity, a growing number of research institutes and commercial companies are exploring the potential of social media in disaster risk management. To understand the development and trends in this domain, a bibliometric analysis was performed using 1573 related published articles in Web of Science between 1991 and 2019. We found that (1) the number of annual publications and new research institutes in this field grew rapidly but seems to have become saturated in recent years. (2) The main research force is independent universities with limited cooperation, and a knowledge network has not yet been formed in this arena. (3) Research hotspots evolve in the path of “conceptualization - refinement - application”. Due to the three features of social media data, namely, timeliness, subjectivity, and disequilibrium, obstacles still exist in applicable disaster types and population representativeness. We anticipate new scientific advances emerging to overcome some technical difficulties. Knowledge sharing, advanced computer science, and multiorganizational cooperation will benefit this arena. These findings indicate potential directions for the development of and innovation in social media-based disaster research.}

In this study, we suggest one possible GIS-based indicator of landscape coherence calculated for a digital landscape model (DLM). It measures the degree to which the visual landscape as a whole exceeds the set of its overlapping components (landforms and land cover) regarding diversity. We verified the performance of the index within the National Park Peneda-Gerês (Northern Portugal) as a study area with cumulative viewsheds based on Flickr and Panoramio geolocated content. The results demonstrate a scale-dependent, positive relationship between the proposed index of landscape coherence for the categorical models and the landscape values. The findings of this study can be applied to landscape planning and management, providing an easy-to-use GIS-based indicator of landscape character assessment.}

At that time, collecting data for this fishery was done with paper logbooks. This made queries and visualization that could inform management decisions towards our objective impossible in a timely manner. To solve this problem, we built successive software prototypes that leveraged location-aware mobile devices, cloud-based computing, and visualization and query of geographic data over the web. The resulting software, eCatch, enabled avoidance of sensitive species and habitats and quantitative reporting on performance metrics related to those activities. What started as a technology solution to a problem of timely scientific monitoring revealed collateral benefits of collaboration with the fishing industry and markets that support sustainable activities.}

In this paper, we utilize a prospective Poisson space-time scan statistic to detect daily clusters of COVID-19 at the county level in the contiguous 48 U.S. and Washington D.C. As the pandemic progresses, we generally find an increase of smaller clusters of remarkably steady relative risk. Daily tracking of significant space-time clusters can facilitate decision-making and public health resource allocation by evaluating and visualizing the size, relative risk, and locations that are identified as COVID-19 hotspots.}

Globally, over 5 billion people have access to mobile phones, with an increasing proportion having access to smartphones with capabilities such as a camera, microphone, global positioning system (GPS), data storage, and networked data transfer. Scientists can view these devices as embedded sensors with the potential to take measurements of the Earth's surface and processes. To advance the state of Earth observation using MPCDs, scientists need to consider terms and concepts, from a broad range of disciplines including citizen science, image analysis, and computer vision. In this paper, as a result of our literature review, we identify a number of considerations for Earth observation using MPCDs such as methods of field collection, collecting measurements over broad areas, errors and biases, data processing, and accessibility of data. Developing effective frameworks for mobile data collection with public participation and strategies for minimizing bias, in combination with advancements in image processing techniques, will offer opportunities to collect Earth sensing data across a range of scales and perspectives, complimenting airborne and spaceborne remote sensing measurements.}

abstract = {Background
Urban planners frequently neglect the role of subjective risk perception during urban cycling. Several findings suggest a complex relationship between the risk of being involved in a crash and the subjective anticipation of this risk.
Data collection and methods
We investigate the relation of objective risks (operationalized through crashes involving cyclists) and subjective risk perception (operationalized through citizens’ reports in a crowdsourcing project) in a medium-sized German city. Using GIS methods, these datasets are linked to various infrastructure and traffic properties that have been found relevant for cycling safety.
Results
Despite a generally high alignment of objective and subjective risk, our findings highlight that the subjective risk perception at a given location can deviate significantly from the actual crash risk. For example, the subjective perception of high risk on one-way streets with bikeways in opposing direction is not matched by a high level of objective risk. Vice versa, some rather dangerous situations (e.g., tram stops) are not perceived as particularly dangerous.
Conclusions
Understanding why and where cyclists over- or underestimate the actual crash risk may provide a foundation for the design of safer cycling infrastructures, as well as for promoting cycling as a comfortable mode of transportation.}

Such areas often have high exposure to the general public, and receive a large number of visits. As a result, urban AOI can reveal useful information for city planners, transportation analysts, and location-based service providers to plan new business, extend existing infrastructure, and so forth. Urban AOI exist in people's perception and are defined by behaviors. However, such perception was rarely captured until the Social Web information technology revolution. Social media data record the interactions between users and their surrounding environment, and thus have the potential to uncover interesting urban areas and their underlying spatiotemporal dynamics. This paper presents a coherent framework for extracting and understanding urban AOI based on geotagged photos. Six different cities from six different countries have been selected for this study, and Flickr photo data covering these cities in the past ten years (2004–2014) have been retrieved. We identify AOI using DBSCAN clustering algorithm, understand AOI by extracting distinctive textual tags and preferable photos, and discuss the spatiotemporal dynamics as well as some insights derived from the AOI. An interactive prototype has also been implemented as a proof-of-concept. While Flickr data have been used in this study, the presented framework can also be applied to other geotagged photos.}

One such measure that is being duplicated in almost every country is that of “lockdowns.” This is having a direct impact on the social and economic welfare of people, especially those domiciled in urban areas, but with the virus spreading in unprecedented way, it is seen as one of the necessary measures for now. As this happens, the global community is seen to be increasing its efforts and collaboration in coming up with a short-term and long-term solution to this pandemic. However, such efforts are facing some deep-rooted challenges related to heath data sharing, where the issue of lack of standardization of protocols is seen to be hampering the efforts, especially with interests from information and communication technology corporationsn and the concept of nationalism coming into play.

This study uses geographical ‘big data’ on point of interest density (POID), degree of urban function mixing (MIX), location check-in density (CIQD), housing prices (HP), and population change (POPC) to measure the urban vitality of patches of new development that occurred in Chinese cities from 2005 to 2015. The study uses association rule analysis to explore the relationship between different urban growth patterns on urban vitality, and the results indicate that different forms of urban growth have different effects on urban vitality. Infilling is characterized by high values for point of interest density and location check-in density with low values for urban function mixing and mixed values for population change. Edge-expansion is associated with high values for population change and urban function mixtures. Outlying expansion is associated with several negative values for urban vitality, particularly variables related to interactions between people and the environment around them (CIQD). The results indicate that cities may utilize these different forms of urban growth patterns to achieve different goals; for example, infilling may be more effective for office-style development in areas with existing higher population density and urban function mixtures, and edge-expansion may be effective for rapidly absorbing large populations and hosting urban functions that require larger footprints. As such, Chinese cities currently undergoing early stages of development should pursue high-intensity edge-expansion development. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first attempt to study the relationship between urban expansion types and urban vitality through the use of ‘big data,’ and the results of this study can provide guidance on urban spatial development for government leaders and researchers in the future.}

We evaluate the two approaches using empirical PPGIS data for the Chugach National Forest planning process where both approaches were implemented in spring of 2012. Results from a larger PPGIS survey completed in 1998 were also included in the study for comparison. We examined the spatial concurrence of the data generated by the two approaches (workshop versus survey) on multiple spatial attributes (landscape values) using three analytical methods—subsampling, resampling, and hotspot analysis. We found little to weak spatial association from the two participatory mapping methods on most landscape values. These results may be attributed to less spatial data for the workshops and to differences in measurement and sampling between the two approaches. The empirical results of low spatial concurrence raise important questions about the use of workshop participatory GIS for planning decision support. We discuss the implications and supporting rationale for using participatory mapping in community meetings.}

The way that nations respond to climate change needs to adapt from a reactive and backward-focused disaster management approach, to become more proactive and to anticipate what is yet to come. Two key challenges restrict climate resilience. First, the social aspects are relevant to resilience, yet many such aspects are not adequately reflected by available statistics. Second, validating indicators of climate resilience is demanding in terms of data availability and methodology. To overcome these challenges, we develop an Empirical Evidence Resilience Index (EERI) based on the Emergency Event Data Base (EM-DAT) to measure resilience. However, just the measurement of resilience does not provide the explanation necessary to determine planning strategies. Therefore, to understand resilience better, we also use statistics from OpenStreetMap (OSM) to predict the EERI and deduce explanatory elements. This step is achieved with a random forest method. We call the resulting prediction of resilience (EERI) from OSM data the Open Resilience Index (ORI). The used explanatory elements from OSM not only cover the physical characteristics of infrastructures, but also include country-level socio-economic information. The results show the relevance of social cohesion (identity & mobility; religion); human development (leisure & recreation, social fabric); economy (economic status; material supply); sustainable infrastructure (available infrastructure; spatial development); and nature conservation for resilience.}

It is the only farmers market directory that provides the geographical coordinates of market locations and allows the public to download the dataset at no cost. The geographic coordinates of the market locations in the directory were collected through a web-based GIS data collection form. This form allows market managers to navigate, review, and adjust market locations on the web-based map, and to save the coordinates of the market locations into the database. However, market location addresses and descriptions provided by users are in an open-ended format, which did not allow automatic verification of the accuracy of a market location. In using the web-based GIS to capture market coordinates, deficiencies in users' computer literacy skills, attention to details, Internet speed, etc. means spatial errors in market locations coordinates were possible. Hence, the directory data, including market location coordinates, has to be validated before it is delivered to the public. This study developed a method to verify the coordinates of farmers market locations by comparing user-generated market coordinates against the geocoded coordinates from multiple geocoding services based on user-submitted market addresses. Using the USDA 2012 National Farmers Market Directory as a test dataset, three-quarters of the market locations generated by farmers market managers were verified as the ground-truth locations. This study suggests that multiple geocoding services provide a feasible and practical method for validating user-generated farmers market locations.}

Though an effective involvement of users in multidimensional modeling is crucial in these projects, not much has been said about how to establish a fruitful collaboration in projects involving numerous users with different skills, reputations, and degrees of authority. This issue is especially relevant in citizen science projects, where several volunteers can contribute their requirements despite not being formally-trained experts in the application domain. To fill this gap, we propose a framework for collaborative multidimensional modeling that can adapt itself to the profiles and skills of the actors involved. We first classify users depending on their authoritativeness, skills, and engagement in the project. Then, following this classification, we identify four possible methodological scenarios and propose a profile-aware methodology supported by two sets of quality attributes. Finally, we describe a Group Decision Support System that implements our methodological framework and present some experiments carried out on a real case study.}

This paper introduces socio-technical transitions theory and multi-level perspective (MLP) framework in particular as a way to structure potential pathways for cadastral systems. The approach emphasizes the role of institutional rules of the game – the regulative, normative and cognitive institutional elements – in socio-technical transition processes. Using the Finnish cadastral system as a case study, we illustrate the approach by forming three alternative transition pathways: (1) a cadastral system under digital transformation, (2) differentiating urban and rural cadastral systems, and (3) a cadastral system facing new data management challenges. After describing each transition pathway with a narrative storyline, we reflect them in light of previous discourses of the cadastral domain. Thereby, the study provides new insights into discussions about the future of cadastral systems and land administration in general.}

abstract = {Energizing the future energy systems requires comprehensive understanding at the urban level. However, many uncertainties hinder such goals, leastwise the data and tools used in modeling urban energy systems (UES). Urban Energy Modeling including spatial parameters of urban forms and settlements can lead to more sustainable approaches in computational simulations. Moreover, scientific policy advice requires that models and data to be transparent and prepared in an unbiased manner. Hence, benchmarking the quality criteria of open source datasets like OpenStreetMap (OSM) data is needed. This contribution introduces UES modelling and its data requirements for different application sectors. Further, it extends and provides a first assessment of OSM data which is used in modeling energy systems in cities. This data was previously used in the context of a UES model developed by the authors. A main conclusion is that although many OSM features are missing and cannot be extracted from OSM, these datasets constitute a great source of open data which can contribute to a more sustainable and transparent modelling.}

abstract = {Identifying the fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure risk for bicycle riders is crucial for promoting the development of theory and technology in transportation-related air pollution assessment as well as urban health planning. Previous studies have employed daily mean PM2.5 concentrations and designed routes to evaluate air pollution exposure risk. However, because the daily mean PM2.5 concentrations cannot fully illustrate the intra-day variations in PM2.5, which are typically higher than daily mean values, the adverse effects of PM2.5 concentrations remain underestimated. Moreover, the quantity and representativeness of monitoring samples make large spatial-scale and multi-temporal-scale analysis challenging. By defining hourly exceedance PM2.5 concentration and sharing bicycle rider data, two novel indicators were proposed in our study: exceedance exposure risk of PM2.5 for sharing bicycle riders (EPSR) and accumulative exceedance exposure risk of PM2.5 for sharing bicycle riders (AEPSR). Standard deviation ellipse analysis was conducted to investigate the multi-temporal variation of ESPR and AEPSR. A geographically weighted regression model was applied to quantify the relationship between city function zones and exceedance PM2.5 exposure risk for sharing bicycle riders. Results revealed that the mean values of EPSR and AEPSR during morning peak periods ranged between 0.109 min μg/m3 and 1.27 min μg/m3 and 6.83 min μg/m3 and 43.41 min μg/m3, respectively, whereas the mean values of EPSR and AEPSR during evening peak periods ranged between 0.19 min μg/m3 and 4.28 min μg/m3 and 14.67 min μg/m3 and 357.66 min μg/m3, respectively. This implied that sharing bicycle riders were exposed to higher PM2.5-related risks during the evening than in the morning. When considering the accumulative effects, the average centers of the AEPSR moved to the north side as compared to the average centers of the EPSR. Expanding areas of EPSR shrunk by 20.25 km2. This indicated that accumulative effects aggregated spatial clusters of exceedance PM2.5 exposure risk for sharing bicycle riders more tightly to the north of the study areas. Spatiotemporal variation of EPSR and AEPSR led us to investigate the mechanism behind this phenomenon. Spatial associations between city function zones and EPSR and AEPSR showed that sharing bicycle riders experienced more severe exceedance PM2.5 exposure risk around financial/corporations and leisure service areas, with R2 values of 0.33 and 0.35, respectively. This spatial association tended to be more significant during the evening peak periods. By developing two novel indicators, the increasing health threats for bicycle riders caused by exceedance PM2.5 were investigated in this study. The mechanism results should be included for developing mitigation strategies to alleviate the adverse effects of air pollution for public rider participators and achieving the goal of eco-health cities.}

The land use planning process is mandated in the Far North Act (received Royal Assent on September 23, 2010). There is a need for capacity enhancement for community-based natural resource planning and management in the Territory. A number of frameworks are emerging for addressing change brought on by resource development and building resilience to such change at the community level. Among these include the concept of adaptive capacity. In collaboration with FN community leaders, we explored the use of “collaborative geomatics” tools to foster adaptive capacity. Our action research suggests that collaborative geomatics technologies should enhance the Mushkegowuk First Nations’ adaptive capacity to address environmental and policy change by allowing them to collect and manage data collaboratively (e.g., traditional environmental knowledge, western science) to create opportunities for innovative community development, including natural resource development and management.}

A methodology is developed to organize and visualize the results of visual screening method with a GIS-oriented database system. Throughout the study, the primary rationale behind conducting the field data collection via utilization of spatial processes is to achieve a standardized and efficient data flow in the presence of multiple data collectors on the field, working in coordination. Incorporated in the process are mobile data collection tools with cloud-support, open online spatial databases, and open-source GIS software. The utilization of these tools instead of paper forms would lead to readily available standardized responses via digital forms, avoiding loss and fragmentation of data and ambiguities in classification, where multiple users contribute to the same repository. In addition, the use of digital tools in field data collection eliminates the data transcription process, significantly reducing the time required for it. Hence, the proposed framework has the potential to represent a fast and reliable overview of structural seismic vulnerability as well as seismic priority for strengthening. As a result of this study, the mobile data transmission in the field and the visualization in GIS are highly recommended to be a standard part of the seismic evaluation procedure.}

Both user groups found the concept useful, but its potential impact was less for the pushchair user group. There were mixed views in relation to the ability of the mashup to convey the trustworthiness, credibility and reliability of information necessary for journey planning.

Remote sensing technologies were used for data collection during disasters. However, due to the large areas affected by major disasters such as Hurricane Matthew, specific data cannot be collected in time such as the location information. Social media can serve as a crowdsourcing platform for citizens’ communication and information sharing during natural disasters and provide the timely data for identifying affected areas to support rapid damage assessment during disasters. Nevertheless, there is very limited existing research on the utility of social media data in damage assessment. Even though some investigation of the relationship between social media activities and damages was conducted, the employment of damage-related social media data in exploring the fore-mentioned relationship remains blank. This paper, for the first time, establishes the index dictionary by semantic analysis for the identification of damage-related tweets posted during Hurricane Matthew in Florida. Meanwhile, the insurance claim data from the publication of Florida Office of Insurance Regulation is used as a representative of real hurricane damage data in Florida. This study performs a correlation analysis and a comparative analysis of the geographic distribution of social media data and damage data at the county level in Florida. We find that employing social media data to identify critical affected areas at the county level during disasters is viable. Damage data has a closer relationship with damage-related tweets than disaster-related tweets.}

The problem of finding a set of travel plans which realizes a set of CDR trajectories and is consistent with a set of link volume counts is rephrased in terms of calibrating a choice model. This enables us to make use of an existing calibration scheme for agent-oriented simulations. We demonstrate our approach by an illustrative scenario with synthetic data.}

The results demonstrate that vulnerability was not evenly distributed across Haikou's coastal zones, which may be linked to the different stages of ongoing urban planning for coastal Haikou. For the case study areas, vulnerability tends to increase with higher levels of urbanization, but may decrease once the speed of urban expansion is under control. The most vulnerable area is the main city zone where urban residents are concentrated and a developed transportation network exists. Our study contributes to the development of a general methodology to assess vulnerability in rapid urbanization and to apply it to coastal cities around the world.}

In this study, we harness state-of-the-art datasets to model cyclists’ route choice based on a case study of the City of Glasgow, Scotland. First, the social fitness network Strava was used to obtain datasets containing the number of cycling trips on each street intersection for the years 2017 and 2018. Second, we employed a Python toolkit to acquire and analyse the street networks. OSMnx was subsequently employed to quantify several commonly used centrality indices (degree, eigenvector, betweenness and closeness) to measure street layout. Due to the presence of spatial dependence, a spatial error model was used to model route choices. Model results demonstrate that: (1) cyclists’ movement models were consistent for the years 2017 and 2018; (2) the presence of a spillover effect suggests that cyclists tend to cycle in proximity to each other; and (3) cyclists avoid streets with high degree centrality values and prefer streets with high eigenvector centrality, betweenness centrality and closeness centrality. These findings reveal cyclists’ desired street layouts and can be taken into consideration for future interventions.}

abstract = {Rural areas in Poland are inhabited by 39.8 % of the country’s population (GUS (Statistics Poland), 2018a). These areas face various challenges related to the development of efficient and competitive agriculture and forest management, while also strengthening their structures as viable living spaces for rural citizens that enable independent life and varied economic activity. Another important challenge arising in this context is preservation of the cultural landscape and natural environment of these areas. Measures to improve rural development instruments have been pursued in Poland for more than a decade. Rural Development Programme for 2014-2020, setting a framework for the development of rural areas in Poland, highlights the need to activate their residents, and to use endogenic potentials to foster local development. The process of spatial planning within rural areas in Poland requires measures promoting creativity among rural residents and enabling their involvement in joint projects. One of the objectives of current rural development projects is to incorporate citizen perspectives within the process of local development. This research aims to identify potential measures that local governments can implement to develop local identity and the sense of belonging. The emergence of Web 2.0 and the release of public application programming interfaces (APIs) for online mapping tools and sites that enable uploading georeferenced content, along with the introduction of mobile location tagging devices, brought a wide range of new possibilities, challenges, and perspectives for rural development. Crowdsourcing - a type of participative online activity - is one of them. It allows effective targeting of relevant social groups, benefitting from their knowledge of the area, their opinions and ideas, and then involving them in the implementation of the planning works, thus enabling exchange of reflections and views among authorities, experts, and the public (“crowd”). Crowdsourcing entails a combination of top-down, traditional, hierarchical process, and a bottom-up, open process engaging an online community. The analysis of trends observed in European policies (such as Collective Awareness Platforms for Sustainability and Social Innovation [CAPs] projects) has revealed that the mobilization of public engagement in land use planning is both desirable and important. The article presents possibilities to introduce the crowdsourcing concept into rural development programmes in Poland, particularly in planning works related to the implementation of land consolidation. A dedicated application LC-CApp (Land Consolidation-Crowdsourcing Application) was created in the GIS environment specifically for this purpose.}

abstract = {Participatory mapping provides a way to collate a wide range of landscape values providing a visual representation to inform conservation planning. We tested the use of an iconic species, the Greater Flamingo, as a lens for participatory mapping to render explicit the socio-cultural values attributed in a landscape. Spatial information on six landscape values in a biodiversity hotspot, the Camargue Biosphere Reserve (southern France) was collected from 113 participants through surveys, interviews and workshops. This data was geo-located through a SoftGIS methodology to map and quantify the overlap of bivariate hotspots identifying value concurrence. The most frequent values recorded through total number of polygons and surface areas were wilderness and recreation. The least frequently mapped values were economic loss and biodiversity. There was frequent concurrence between biodiversity and aesthetic values especially in wetlands (lagoons, salt flats and sea). There was also frequent concurrence between biodiversity and recreational values with more overlap in sites with easy access (along roads and public areas). Our results show that using an iconic species is an effective way to render explicit spatial variations in the values attributed to a landscape and to identify concurrence of values, thus enabling integration of multiple landscape values in conservation planning.}

This is fuelled by the proliferation of location-aware devices such as smartphones and tablets; users are able to share information in these crowdsourcing platforms directly from the field at real time, augmenting this information with its location.

This paper explores how to improve on the interoperability of Web 2.0 services by providing a single service as a unique entry to search over several Web 2.0 services in a single step. This paper demonstrates the usefulness of the Open Geospatial Consortium's OpenSearch Geospatial and Time specification as an interface for a service that searches and retrieves information available in crowdsourcing services. We present how this information is valuable in complementing other authoritative information by providing an alternative, contemporary source. We demonstrate the intrinsic interoperability of the system showing the integration of crowd-sourced data in different scenarios.}

However, it extends and differs from purely qualitative research by integrating additional qualitative, quantitative, and multiple methodology techniques to investigate complex scenarios in a natural setting. Naturalistic inquiry provides the human geographer with a paradigm and context within which to conduct research in natural settings involving complex interactions between humans, society, and their environment. The naturalistic methodology assumes specific philosophical approaches that inform and guide its implementation. These include multiple constructed realities that can only be studied holistically, and the researcher and the subject of inquiry influence one another. Due to these limitations, the inquiry aims to develop a case-based, idiographic body of knowledge in the form of a collection of data or a working hypothesis. This approach explicitly acknowledges that all inquiry, including the biases and power relations of the researcher in framing the questions, the theory, paradigms, and approach behind the research, is value-laden. Naturalistic inquiry provides the human geographer with a paradigm and context within which to conduct research in natural settings involving complex interactions among humans, society, and their environment. It fits within the recent debates about practicing geography, the ethics of doing research, and a framework for establishing and clarifying whom the research is on, by, for, or with. Naturalistic Inquiry is becoming more salient to human geography, as it affords a methodology to understand how different and diverse groups share familiar places and spaces. The research operates in an iterative process to establish credibility, transferability, and dependability.}

However, methodological frameworks for informing urban regeneration at a fine-grain neighborhood scale through LBSNs is still by and large an unchartered territory, which this research seeks to address. This research bridges the knowledge gap by proposing a method to identify urban opportunity spaces for urban regeneration that involves pre-processing, analyzing and interpreting single and overlapped LBSN data. A two-fold perspective—people-based and place-based—is adopted. Data from four LBSNs—Foursquare, Twitter, Google Places and Airbnb—represent the people-based approach as it offers an insight into individual preferences, use and activities. The place-based approach is provided by an illustrative case study. Local unexpected nuances were gathered by the interlinking of data from different LBSNs, and opportunity places for urban regeneration have been recognized, as well as potential itineraries to boost urban liveliness and connectivity at both intra and inter- neighborhood scales. Findings show that overlapping data from various LBSNs enriches the analysis that would previously have relied on a single source.}

The aim is to compare different methods, both quantitative and qualitative, and to assess which are more cost effective rather than detail the process of recovery after particular events. The paper also discusses how resilience relates to recovery. The methods trialled are all capable of measuring the speed, and to some extent the quality, of recovery, but the merits of each depends on the resources available and the level of detail or precision required. The recommended approach is to use the methods in combination. Specifically satellite imagery analysis can be combined with ground survey, social audit and published data to develop a spatial-temporal geo-database that can be used to monitor recovery. To date, however, it would appear to be challenging to measure resilience. An approach might be to attempt to isolate the factors underlying resilience and focus on measuring these. This might be achieved by analysing recovery after a wide variety of events and building models of resilience based on these factors. These predictions of resiliencey for a wide range of countries at risk might then be compared with the speed and quality recovery after future events.}

This article aims to propose a formal modeling approach helps facilitate decision making about navigation pathways. The proposed data model is based on an objective orientation idea. City features, such as street features, buildings and environmental areas, are organized as a series of function objects that meet the various needs of the blind. They are linked by paths with obstacles and irregular surface objects. A complex function object is composed of several inner function objects and paths; thus, it can reflect the spatial layout at various levels. Detailed semantic content can be added into the objects as an extension that enhances the representation and facilitates spatial learning. The geometric shapes of the proposed objects and their topological information are also recorded for local navigation and comprehensive path planning. To examine the usability of the data model, a prototype system was developed using the Chinese university of Hong Kong as a study area, and test cases are illustrated for a typical designed scenario.}

The open data movement promises to address this gap by offering alternative sources for information and free or low cost analytical platforms. However, in order to use open data effectively, urban managers and planners need guidance to navigate these new data sources, software, and server platforms, as well as acquire the necessary skills. In this paper, we begin to address these issues by developing a framework that organizes the sprawling and rapidly evolving world of open urban data. Our framework includes three broad categories (1) inputs and resources, (2) activities and outputs, and (3) outcomes. We then identify and describe the key subcomponents under each, and list the prominent products and resources available to urban managers and planners. For example, under inputs and resources, we discuss open urban data sources such as Open Street Maps, cyberinfrastructure for web hosting, application deployment, and data processing, and open source software that can be used to analyze and visualize collected or derived data. We also identify the key resources available to planners for training and discuss the complementary opportunities presented by conventional datasets such as census and open urban data. Finally, using examples from ongoing activities in Mumbai, we show how open data resources can be useful for understanding urbanization and better integrating informal settlements into formal urban management and planning processes. We suggest that urban managers and planners working in informal settlements should take greater advantage of open data resources in order to both better address current challenges as well as for shaping a better future for the communities they serve.}

Haptics is increasingly important to human geography, for its power to represent information, connect people separated by distance, and improve the quality of interaction and immersion with media used to represent geographic information. Haptics refers to touch in the widest sense, including the sensing of information from the skin as well as the movement and position of joints, limbs, and fingers. Touch can be regarded as a mechanism for gaining knowledge about the environment from the things we are able to touch directly, and through models and representations of geographic space that are designed to be experienced and interacted with through touch. Objects that are physically, tangibly sensed via touching would include tactile maps, three-dimensional models, and touch-based representations in virtual reconstructions. Virtual reality simulations are manipulated and interacted with through touch and through force feedback in haptic-based virtual reality. Manipulating objects leads to the acquisition and development of the abilities to learn geographic space, and is a precursor to complex understanding of spatial arrangements. Although there are limitations to any sense, touch provides a critical embodied relationship between an individual and his/her proximal environment. The central nature of touch to our sensory relationship with the world means that touch is so intuitive as to go unnoticed. Our bodies are touched and being touched by the immediacy of our surroundings. The chair that we sit in, the feel of the ground underfoot, and the reciprocal sensing of a road as we drive a car, all provide evidence that touch is the most central and essential of all our senses. To paraphrase the philosopher Bertrand Russell, touch gives us our sense of “reality,” our whole conception of what exists outside us is based upon the sense of touch.}

The results of this research contribute to both the methodological and the empirical perspectives: We examined the effectiveness of the dynamic time warping (DTW) distances in measuring the differences between long-term mass media data. We identified four types of connection strength patterns between China and its top 15 related countries. With that, the distance decay effect in mass media is also examined and compared with social media and public transportation data. While using multiple datasets and focusing on mass media, this study generates valuable input regarding the interpretation of the diplomatic and regional correlation for the nation of China. It also provides methodological references for investigating international relations in other countries and regions in the big data era.}

Our responses to graffiti range from recognition of artistry, to interpreting it as a sign of urban decay and disorder. Major cities respond to tax-payers with this latter response by providing graffiti abatement programs, often at substantial cost; thus, understanding and mitigating the causes of graffiti has tangible value. Using spatial analysis, we explore the combined causes of graffiti creation and the subsequent reporting of graffiti for removal in San Francisco, CA, USA. Using a combination of census data and city data, we identify five factors that have significant correlation to graffiti reports, and use them to build a regression model. We show that graffiti is created in areas with high densities of young males, and that commercial zones have the highest rate of graffiti reports. We show that a Geographically Weighted Regression model of these five factors explains over two-thirds of the variation in graffiti reports in San Francisco. Further, our findings are consistent with the dual hypotheses of graffiti as a form of communication or advertising aimed at a target market of other young males, along with the broken window thesis of graffiti interpreted as a sign of social disorder.}

These early attempts provide us with only narrow visibility of multidimensional well-being but prove to us that mart well-being measurement systems are possible—and useful—to build. A street imagery tool and an image assessment with a machine learning technique was used for evaluating streetscapes and perceptions of heat wave tweets in Kyojima district and in Tokyo, Japan.

However, big data brings lots of “big errors” in data quality and data usage, which cannot be used as a substitute for sound research design and solid theories.

The latter are discussed under the rubrics of The Data Revolution, Urban (Spatial) Informatics, and Ambient Computing. Two major thrusts have persisted throughout the years: the use of numerical techniques to solve large, complex quantitative problems; the development of models of complex spatial processes expressed directly in computational terms. Both have evolved with the times and continue to be central to computational human geography. Critiques originate from both within the field and from the humanities and social theory perspectives.

To discern emerging patterns in citizen science-based studies on topics with relevance for sustainable agriculture and reveal salient challenges and opportunities for conducting such studies, we conducted a literature review of 27 articles from the period 2004–2019 of 250 publications screened from Google Scholar. These articles were thematically grouped under the topics: Soil health, climate adaptation, pest/pathogen monitoring, invasive species, inputs and outputs and pollination. Participants’ characteristics, motivations, study design and project outcomes in the reviewed articles were summarized and discussed. Both observational and experimental studies were represented in the articles, while emerging trends point towards field experimentation and ‘Large-N′ trials by lay farmers. Crowdsourcing lends itself to projects where the main role of the public is local visual observations and reporting, such as in pest/pathogen monitoring. Challenges included methodological issues such as validation procedures, but above all motivation, recruitment, and retention of volunteers. Despite the importance of participatory approaches for deeper citizen involvement for sustainability transitions and for the quality of knowledge outcomes, the role of citizens was overall restricted to data collection. Several of the methodologies proposed would be difficult to implement in low-income countries, and relatively few studies pertained to agricultural concerns of the global South. To lend value to farmers' time, we recommend projects relevant to livelihoods, health issues or local farming problems, accompanied by well-structured data feedback protocols, routing study results back to farmers.}

To this regard, also German urban planning policies show considerable dynamics. After several urban containment policies were introduced, the question arises on how to empirically assess their effects. Therefore, monitoring approaches with a regional perspective become more and more relevant, as polycentric, suburban settlement structures constitute the spatial but also institutional context of urban containment policies. Considering suburbanisation as a global phenomenon, we develop a monitoring approach, which allows for a quantitative and qualitative assessment within suburban settlement structures. We propose a set of indicators that integrates urban structure, regional accessibility and usage by population. As data is scarce for a city-regional perspective, we combine geospatial methods for an automatic identification of building types from topographic data and maps, for measuring multi-modal accessibility and for small scale demographic analysis. The approach is applied to the case of a German city-region with splintered planning institutions. The results of the small-scale, but also comprehensive regional analysis allow for a detailed discussion of effects of policy changes on the settlement structure.}

abstract = {The use of new forms of data in the transport research domain is rapidly gaining popularity. However, these data come with specific challenges and one of the major concerns is maintaining the privacy of data subjects. One widely used approach to anonymise the data is to apply binning. Recently, data from activity-tracking applications like Strava has been utilised to study and analyse active travel. Due to privacy concerns, Strava has started providing data in a discretised format from July 2018. In this study, we aim to analyse the impact of the binning criteria on the utility of the crowdsourced data by using Strava data from 2013 to 2016 for the city of Glasgow. We applied the Strava binning criteria on the original dataset at three different temporal aggregations (i.e., Hourly, Daily and Monthly) and conducted different analyses to examine its impacts. First, we compared manual cycling counts with original and binned cycling counts from Strava data. Second, net-errors were calculated by comparing original and binned cycling counts from Strava data. Third, we estimated spatial autocorrelation statistics based on original and binned Strava counts and investigated the extent to which research outcomes change because of the binning approach. Our results confirmed significant amount of information loss. Worryingly, we also show that conclusions reached by previous studies could have been reversed if the new specification of the data had been used. We outline here what precautions researchers and planners should take when working with the binned data.}

Previous studies have relied on low-throughput surveys and limited data sources, which have difficulty in measuring the human perception of a large-scale urban region at flexible spatial resolutions. In this work, a data-driven machine learning approach is proposed to measure how people perceive a place in a large-scale urban region. Specifically, a deep learning model, which has been trained on millions of human ratings of street-level imagery, was used to predict human perceptions of a street view image. The model achieved a high accuracy rate in predicting six human perceptual indicators, namely, safe, lively, beautiful, wealthy, depressing, and boring. This model can help to map the distribution of the city-wide human perception for a new urban region. Furthermore, a series of statistical analyses was conducted to determine the visual elements that may cause a place to be perceived as different perceptions. From the 150 object categories segmented from the street view images, various objects were identified as being positively or negatively correlated with each of the six perceptual indicators. The results take researchers and urban planners one step toward understanding the interactions of the place sentiments and semantics.}

The largest tracts of ecologically most valuable roadless areas refer to large unfragmented forests regions, both in the tropics and the boreal zone (Amazon, Congo basin, East and Southeast Asia). Among all terrestrial ecosystems, roadless forests are the single most important strongholds of regulating ecosystem services: among others, soil protection, water retention, buffering of the local and regional climate and mitigation of global climate change via capturing of atmospheric carbon. But roadless areas also comprise much demanded natural resource assets, such as timber, often also minerals and space for agricultural development. There is a substantial conflict between diverse short-term economic interests and the long-term conservation of roadless areas. Large roadless areas can serve as a measurable surrogate for the most pristine and functional ecosystems. Roadlessness is a property of areas, which are not impacted by roads; it can be used as a proxy for assessing ecosystem integrity and the absence of many anthropogenic disturbances. We recommend that policy-makers give roadless areas conservation priority over areas that have already been fragmented. It is essential to establish roadlessness as a criterion for the planning of ecosystem-based, cost-effective sustainable development. In parallel with measures to protect roadlessness, we recommend alternative approaches to mobility that can work under roadless conditions, e.g., related to railroads, blimps and other low-energy technologies with low infrastructure requirements. Even if “climate-friendly” renewable energy was available for road transport on a large scale, the construction, existence and operation of roads would continue to severely impair ecosystem functionality.}

This article presents a case study from the Central Tablelands region of New South Wales, Australia, where landholders have been involved in participatory development of a new online collaboration tool. The case study results highlight the significance of issues such as internet access, privacy, technical proficiency and differing stakeholder objectives. A landholder survey identified mapping and the uploading of monitoring data as important functions for the online tool, but these were not rated as highly as functions relating to data security, sharing settings and key term searches. Consequently, we recommend that a future online collaboration tool for the region is not framed specifically as a mapping or citizen science tool, but rather as an adaptive collaboration and communication tool that can incorporate a variety of data types and formats and be modified over time in line with changing landholder needs.}

Different from the ordinary 3D objects in computer graphics, polygons in 3D city objects are usually correlated e.g. parallel to each other or nearly located in the same plane. Therefore, PCA can reduce the data volume efficiently. According to the experimental results, the proposed method can compress the 3D city models by 95% while preserving the overall similarity between the simplified and original models.}

An empirical approach to map apparent temperature at the neighborhood scale, which relies on publicly available weather station observations and spatial data layers combined in a random forest regression model, was demonstrated for greater Vancouver, Canada. Model errors were acceptable (cross-validated RMSE=2.04°C) and the resulting map of apparent temperature, calibrated for a typical hot summer day, corresponded well with past temperature research in the area. A comparison with field measurements as well as similar maps of skin temperature and air temperature revealed that skin temperature was poorly correlated with both air temperature (R2=0.38) and apparent temperature (R2=0.39). While the latter two were more similar (R2=0.87), apparent temperature was predicted to exceed air temperature by more than 5°C in several urban areas as well as around the confluence of the Pitt and Fraser rivers. We conclude that skin temperature is not a suitable proxy for human heat exposure, and that spatial epidemiology studies could benefit from mapping apparent temperature, using an approach similar to the one reported here, to better quantify differences in heat exposure that exist across an urban landscape.}

Remote sensing imagery with largescale coverage and accurate target descriptions, has been regarded as an ideal solution for monitoring the urban environment. However, due to the heterogeneity of remote sensing images, it is difficult to access their geographical content at the object level, let alone understanding urban scenes at the block level. Recently, deep learning-based strategies have been applied to interpret urban scenes with remarkable accuracies. However, the deep neural networks require a substantial number of training samples which are hard to satisfy, especially for high-resolution images. Meanwhile, the crowed-sourced Open Street Map (OSM) data provides rich annotation information about the urban targets but may encounter the problem of insufficient sampling (limited by the places where people can go). As a result, the combination of OSM and remote sensing images for efficient urban scene recognition is urgently needed. In this paper, we present a novel strategy to transfer existing OSM data to high-resolution images for semantic element determination and urban scene understanding. To be specific, the object-based convolutional neural network (OCNN) can be utilized for geographical object detection by feeding it rich semantic elements derived from OSM data. Then, geographical objects are further delineated into their functional labels by integrating points of interest (POIs), which contain rich semantic terms, such as commercial or educational labels. Lastly, the categories of urban scenes are easily acquired from the semantic objects inside. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method has an ability to classify complex urban scenes. The classification accuracies of the Beijing dataset are as high as 91% at the object-level and 88% at the scene level. Additionally, we are probably the first to investigate the object level semantic mapping by incorporating high-resolution images and OSM data of urban areas. Consequently, the method presented is effective in delineating urban scenes that could further boost urban environment monitoring and planning with high-resolution images.}

In this respect, in this paper a set of streets in the city center has been evaluated, by combining the results of ANP with spatial data using Geographic Information Systems (GIS), producing thematic maps and an index of pedestrian priority to derive a priority of intervention. Some streets have been redesigned with the aim to increase their walking attractiveness.

However, socio-economic information is distinctly underrepresented in the rapidly growing supply of spatial information. The spatial distribution of current and future activities and opinions has traditionally been the silent information of scientists, local actors and the public. Moreover, future projections and policies exist in qualitative, non-spatial formats, incompatible with quantitative biophysical spatial data layers. This article aims at promoting the generation and application of spatial socio-economic information for the purposes of MSP. We examine one workflow of converting the socio-economic knowledge of individual experts to spatial data, and further to refined spatial knowledge. We illustrate how participatory mapping, data interpretation and core geocomputing methods may be used to generate data, and discuss the main issues related to their generation and use. The results suggest that participatory mapping can provide valuable data for the MSP process, helping in filling the gap of missing socio-economic information. The process is highly subjective: the presentation of background information, the framing of the questions and the interpretation of the spatial data may have notable influence on the generated information. Furthermore, both the technology of the data collection and applied analysis methods have distinct effects on spatial information and its validity.}

Many people prefer to bike on facilities separated from motor vehicles, such as multiuse trails. However, due to underreporting, cities lack data on bike collisions, especially along greenways and multiuse paths. We used a crowdsourced cycling incident dataset (2005–2016) from BikeMaps.org for the Capital Regional District (CRD), BC, Canada. Our goal was to identify design characteristics associated with unsafe intersections between multiuse trails and roads. 92.8% of mapped incidents occurred between 2014 and 2016. We extracted both collision and near miss incidents at intersections from BikeMaps.org. We conducted site observations at 32 intersections where a major multiuse trail intersected with roads. We compared attributes of reported incidents at multiuse trail-road intersections to those at road-road intersections. We then used negative binomial regression to model the relationship between the number of incidents and the infrastructure characteristics at multiuse trail-road intersections. We found a higher proportion of collisions (38%, or 17/45 total reports) at multiuse trail-road intersections compared to road-road intersections (23%, or 62/268 total reports). A higher proportion of incidents resulted in an injury at multiuse trail-road intersections compared to road-road intersections (33% versus 15%). Cycling volumes, vehicle volumes, and trail sight distance were all associated with incident frequency at multiuse trail–road intersections. Supplementing traditional crash records with crowdsourced cycling incident data provides valuable evidence on cycling safety at intersections between multiuse trails and roads, and more generally, when conflicts occur between diverse transportation modes.}

This paper is intended to be a synthesis, but not necessarily a consensus of the key issues and research priorities. We have organized the paper into six general key issues and four priority research topics. The key issues are: (1) conceptual and theoretical foundations, (2) the diversity of definitions and approaches to participatory mapping, (3) the spatial attributes measured in participatory mapping, (4) sampling, participation, and data quality, (5) relationships between participatory mapped attributes and physical places, and (6) the integration of PPGIS data into planning decision support. Our top research priorities include: (1) understanding and increasing participation rates, (2) identifying and controlling threats to spatial data quality, (3) improving the “PP” or public participation in PPGIS, and (4) evaluating the effectiveness of PPGIS. Our purpose for presenting a research agenda is to stimulate discourse among PPGIS researchers and practitioners about future research needs and to provide support for the mobilization of resources to undertake future empirical research.}

This background review then was complemented with a set of interviews with personnel from seven intermediate- to large-size law enforcement agencies in the United States in order to establish the current state of practice of spatiotemporal crime analysis. The comparison of science and practice revealed a variety of insights into the current practice of spatiotemporal crime analysis as well as identified four broad, currently unmet needs: (1) improve access to externally maintained government datasets and allow for flexible and dynamic combination of these datasets; (2) place an emphasis on user interface design in order to improve the usability of crime mapping and analysis tools, (3) integrate geographic and temporal representations and analyses methods to better unlock insight into spatiotemporal criminal activity, and (4) improve support for strategic crime analysis and, ultimately, public safety policymaking and administration.

There are four unstoppable trends in the future development of GISystems: (1) Web-based and Cloud-based GIS; (2) personalized data collection methods via mobile apps, drones, digital cameras, and portable LIDAR devices; (3) high-performance computing frameworks and dynamic data storage services; and (4) lightweight and responsive mapping application programming interfaces with lightweight geodata exchange formats. These new developments will facilitate new types of GIServices, including self-driving cars, smart transportation systems, and smart city applications. Intelligent web mapping services will provide 3D and real-time map display functions across various display devices. Location-based services will be improved by combining both outdoor positioning systems and indoor positioning systems. However, the spatial disparity of geospatial technology and the potential digital discrimination between rural and urban areas could trigger serious social problems and social unrest in the future.}

In this paper, we reviewed crowdsourcing initiatives in agricultural science and farming activities and further discussed the particular characteristics of this approach in the field of agriculture. On-going crowdsourcing initiatives in agriculture were analysed and categorised according to their crowdsourcing component. We identified eight types of agricultural data and information that can be generated from crowdsourcing initiatives. Subsequently we described existing methods of quality control of the crowdsourced data. We analysed the profiles of potential contributors in crowdsourcing initiatives in agriculture, suggested ways for increasing farmers’ participation, and discussed the on-going initiatives in the light of their target beneficiaries. While crowdsourcing is reported to be an efficient way of collecting observations relevant to environmental monitoring and contributing to science in general, we pointed out that crowdsourcing applications in agriculture may be hampered by privacy issues and other barriers to participation. Close connections with the farming sector, including extension services and farm advisory companies, could leverage the potential of crowdsourcing for both agricultural research and farming applications. This paper coins the term of farmsourcing asa professional crowdsourcing strategy in farming activities and provides a source of recommendations and inspirations for future collaborative actions in agricultural crowdsourcing.}

In this study, various types of spatio-temporal data were collected and used to estimate the spatio-temporal variation of PM2.5 exposure in Beijing in 2014. The seasonal and daily variation of the population-weighted exposure level (PWEL) in 2014 was estimated and compared. The results show that the population exposure to ambient air pollution differs significantly in the four seasons, and the exposure levels in winter and spring are notably higher than the other seasons; the exposure level changes greatly from North to South, and each sub-district maintains similarity to neighboring sub-districts.}

In that context, this research paper investigates how new technologies contribute in the promotion of community engagement in urban planning. In a parallel manner, this paper attempts to locate the effects that are expected to have technologically advanced applications in participant planning in the local community. In order to examine the above issues, an international literature review occurs and institutional guidelines towards this sector are investigated, in European level. Furthermore, the investigation of case studies is utilized in order to establish a guide of line practices and locate the effects that presented similar policies in societies that implemented them. All the above contribute to an ex-ante evaluation of the application of such practices in Greece, in order to find out how much usefulness will their integration provide to the procedures of spatial planning of the country.}

abstract = {Landmarks, salient spatial elements, are often argued to play an important role in the formation of mental representations of space. They are likely to be perceived due to their salience and they can be used as spatial reference points to memorize the locations of other spatial elements. In maps, landmarks are often represented as pictograms. Similar to real world objects, their likelihood to be perceived and used as spatial reference points depends on salience characteristics. In this paper, we investigate the structural salience of landmark pictograms in maps, based on their location relative to a task-relevant object. Using eye tracking, we aimed to identify distance parameters that predict the structural salience of landmark pictograms in an object location memory task. Additionally, we investigated whether the availability of structurally salient landmark pictograms improves object location memory. Our results show that landmark pictograms close to a to-be-learned object and the cardinal axes of the to-be-learned object were fixated more often. However, only the distance to the to-be-learned object was found to be related to object location memory performance. An increased location memory performance was observed when landmark pictograms were available close to the to-be-learned object. We argue that proximity of a landmark pictogram to a task-relevant object location and its cardinal axes can be used as parameters for its structural salience. We also found some first evidence that the availability of structurally salient landmark pictograms may improve object location memory performance.}

Social network sites offer massive amounts of potentially relevant data, but its quality and fitness for research purposes must be verified. Our framework uses computer vision to analyse the content of geo-tagged photos on social network sites to generate descriptive tags.

abstract = {Public transport in urban and suburban areas is not always able to meet population's need of accessibility to jobs, education, health and other opportunities in terms of routes and frequencies; therefore, those who do not own a private vehicle, or who cannot afford individual public transport (e.g. taxis), are often in a condition of social exclusion. Taking advantages of new ICT tools and facilities, Demand Responsive Shared Transport (DRST) services can provide “on demand” transport gathering ride bookings of different users and routing a fleet of vehicles to satisfy passengers' needs while minimizing the cost for the operator. In this paper, different DRST service configurations are compared to taxi services to investigate their economic attractiveness and sustainability. This is done by using an agent-based simulation model applied to the case of Ragusa (Italy), a city with poor public transport supply, where an innovative DRST service has already been experimented. A set of 50 different scenarios has been simulated, by varying the numbers of vehicles and seat capacity, and considering different demand rates and route choice strategies of the vehicles. Results are analyzed according to different key performance indicators, mainly showing that the DRST system is more advantageous than taxis when dealing with higher demand rates. On the other hand, the efficiency of the DRST system is rather limited compared to taxis in the case of low transport demand and fleets with a small number of vehicles. Between high and low demand there is a balance between the taxi and the DRST systems, where one should deepen the analysis to identify optimal operational parameters. These results pave the way for further analyses to help the planning and design of intermediate transport services like DRST, which are able to bridge the gap between collective and individual transport in urban and suburban areas.}

We apply our approach to the City of Austin and show that our method can yield fairly accurate predictions. In searching for the best predictive models, we experiment with eight different machine learning algorithms and 60 predictor variables that characterize the social environment, the physical environment, and the aspects and degrees of neighborhood disorder. Our analysis suggests that (a) the sociodemographic and socioeconomic variables are the strongest predictors for tract-level health outcomes and (b) the historical records of 311 service requests can be a useful complementary data source as the information distilled from the 311 data often helps improve the models' performance. The machine learning models yielded from this study can help the public and city officials evaluate future scenarios and understand how changes in the neighborhood conditions can lead to changes in the health outcomes. By analyzing where the most significant discrepancies between the predicted and the actual values are, we will also be ready to identify areas of best practice and areas in need of greater investment or policy intervention.}

The objective of the present paper is to report on damage to structures in Talcahuano. A preliminary survey was performed by the Municipality of Talcahuano and covered the entire affected area with a cellphone web application used to report the severity and distribution of damage. A more comprehensive damage survey was conducted in the Brisa del Sol neighborhood in the Medio Camino area by the UCSC team to assess the damage distribution within an area with well-defined and homogeneous building typologies. The results of the field surveys showed that the tornado behaved as a skipping tornado and that most damage to houses consisted of wall opening damage, roof sheathing failure, and wall cover removal (EF0), followed by partial roof removal (EF1). It was noticeable that self-built systems (house additions) were more damaged than original houses, which may be explained by the fact that such structures do not always meet minimum building standards. It is recommended that field surveys conducted by municipalities and the Ministry of Social Development consider typical damage types rather than just categories such as minor, moderate, or major. Finally, it is recommended that the feasibility of implementing mitigation measures such as stricter wind load provisions and dual-objective tornado design philosophy in the Concepción-Talcahuano area be analyzed.}

While they have historically been drawn by hand, maps are often created today using a modern geographic contribution, geographic information systems (GIS). This field of study includes a broad collection of tools, techniques, and ways of thinking about spatial data and how it can be analyzed and displayed. Technicians collect field data with a GPS unit, analysts use desktop computers to make sense of spatial data, cartographers use GIS technology to visualize information, and policy-makers base decisions on map service providers engaged in the practice of GIS. With GIS, we can not only visualize spatial data, we can also analyze it for patterns to gain a better understanding of the natural and human world. Remote sensing (RS) is an overlapping field that centers on the use of raster imagery for monitoring and analyzing the world. Remotely sensed data are often used as a component of a GIS analysis. It is imperative that librarians be familiar with geospatial analysis and RS to assist clients in finding geospatial resources and creating instructional services for online mapping programs. This chapter defines and describes GIS and RS and how they can be used to study, monitor, and manage both natural and cultural factors in the world.}

It is thus timely to consider whether and to what extent urban forests and other green spaces can be effectively integrated into smart city planning, to maximize green benefits for all city dwellers. We address this gap by exploring current and emerging smart city trends and technologies, and highlight practical applications for urban forest and green space management. Current “smart urban forest” projects reveal a focus on novel monitoring techniques using sensors and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, as well as open data and citizen engagement, particularly through the use of mobile devices, applications (“apps”), and open-source mapping platforms. We propose a definition and promising approach to “smart urban forest management”, emphasizing both the potential of digital infrastructure to enhance forest benefits and the facilitation of citizen stewardship and empowerment in green space planning. Cities are getting faster and smarter – can (and should) the trees, and their managers, do the same?}

We developed a formalized doctoral education and research training programme in GIScience at the University of Salzburg, by integrating students in three focused, interconnected, interdisciplinary research clusters. We illustrate how this programme seeks to acknowledge spatial principles, to explore scientific and educational uses of geographic information in order to elucidate the complex relationships that individuals and society have with GIS. It provides a framework for „education through research’ programme.}

Flood crisis communication, which takes place in the face of incoming danger, needs a practical and operative approach to cope with potentially destructive, large-scale natural disasters. Since floods are one of the most predictable georisks, communication is an efficient means to reduce risk, especially by reducing people's exposure. Many authors discussed the nature of risk communication. Regarding flood risk, most works are devoted to long-term communication plans, but more practical indications on how to communicate during - or shortly before - an (expected) emergency are lacking. Therefore, we present here a framework providing recommendations on what should be the information conveyed in a flood warning message and with what communication medium it should be issued, depending on the criticality level of the expected flood, on the resources of the institution in charge for the warning and on the specific advantages of each medium. Therefore, the framework shown in this paper provides an easy to employ handbook for civil protection operators to define the suitable content, shape and medium for warning messages toward the population. This framework addresses common issues such as the possibility of false alarms or the lack of personnel in charge of risk communication, as well as the role of social media (and their limits), that in many cases is still not well understood.}

However, EWSs have traditionally focused on technology and infrastructure with the absence of comprehensive engagement with the community across the four EWS elements of risk knowledge, monitoring, dissemination and communication and response capability. Subsequently, past experience shows inappropriate responses by communities during disasters. This study reviews definitions, concepts and evolution of EWSs, and the applicability of Community Engagement (CE) in EWSs. It aims to systematically review how the community is engaged in the four elements of EWSs using evidence from the literature sourced from peer-reviewed articles and grey literature. From a total of 4211 initial documents sourced from 2008 to 2018, 31 documents (15 peer-reviewed journal articles and 16 grey literature from project reports) were finally selected to review after an extensive screening process. Of the 31 documents, most of them were from Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) especially the Asian region, followed by the African region. The findings indicate inadequate CE across the four EWS elements (dominating in the risk knowledge element with a single hazard focus). Identified key issues included challenges for sustainability of CE in EWSs, inadequate integration of local and scientific knowledge into EWS design and operation and insufficient consideration of the full range of vulnerable groups in the system. More systematic and sustained efforts are required to improve CE in all EWS elements in order to achieve more effective disaster response.}

This study uses a combination of Geographical Information System techniques and Remote Sensing data (MODIS LST and NDVI), as a preliminary investigation, to assess the spatial relationship between UHI, urban greenspace, household income and electricity consumption in Birmingham, UK. It provides simple and repeatable steps, based on freely available datasets, for urban planners, industry, human and physical geographers, and non-specialists to reproduce the analyses. The results show that, the present impact of the UHI is limited and instead highlights the dominance of household income over local climate in explaining consumption patterns across Birmingham.}

The perception and behavioral characteristics of people derived from crowdsourced data, such as social media and mobile phone signaling data, can provide information sources for disaster assessment and assist disaster emergency management. This topic has attracted extensive attention from scholars. However, these data types are incomplete and have wide-ranging quality, which makes it difficult to evaluate the disaster. Social media data contain many public descriptions of disasters, but the spatial distribution is uneven. Mobile phone signaling data cover a wide range and are spatiotemporal continuous, but semantic information is lacking. Thus, this paper develops a disaster impact assessment method that integrates social media data and mobile signaling data based on a classification of social media data with a character-level convolutional neural network (Char-CNN), anomaly detection in mobile signaling data, and feature mining of human activity. The result shows that social media and mobile signaling data complement each other well. The proposed method improves the assessment accuracy and provides detailed information on the spatial distribution of disasters. The results of this study provide reference for the combination of different sources of information for disaster response decisions.}

It is a challenging environment, because the region is very low lying and the soil is sandy; further, acceleration in climate change and rising water levels will also have severe impact on the land and the peoples. The population is diverse, and includes many minority groups. At this time, the key subsistence activities of the people include fishing and fruit collecting; some also herd goats and sheep, and grow crops; and others engage in tourism and produce handcrafts for sale. The use of geotechnologies, and the creation of a Cybercartographic Atlas, together with a participatory and interdisciplinary approach to research, can together contribute to a deeper understanding of the nature of land use in this region, and thus contribute profoundly to improving the quality of life of the local people. The main objective of this chapter will be to examine the work and methodology used on the Cybercartographic Atlas for Lençóis Maranhenses National Park, as well as to incorporate and encourage participation not only by the academic-scientific sector but also by land administrators and the local population, particularly those who live within Lençóis Maranhenses and its sphere of influence. In the future, it is expected that this inclusive methodological approach to research can be applied in other regions in Brazil where there are comparable socio-environmental conflicts impacting minority groups; for example, indigenous populations, communities of ‘quilombolas’ (descendants of slaves), ‘caiçaras’ (seashore population) and others.}

Throughout time, environmental researchers have been using different tools and methods to determine and record location/description of observations with all limitations on their use. Lately, more and more common digital methods and new technologies have been gaining interest and popularity within the environmental science community. Among those technologies there are mobile mapping devices and applications which have been gaining audience in recent time. dedicated Handheld devices such as consumer-grade GPS (Global Positioning System) dedicated for tourism purposes have been substituted by smartphones and tablets with integrated GPS receiver so that field mapping became much easier and more readily available to a broader audience. Although the possibility of using mobile devices and dedicated applications for field mapping has an increasing trend, there is very little attention dedicated to them in methodology sections of research works. The purpose of this paper is to bring further awareness about such technologies to environmental researchers as they could benefit from using dedicated software available for mobile devices. Such software could ameliorate their workflow, accuracy and quality of data, which can help to achieve better research results. We briefly present our review result of mobile applications for field mapping as the first global overview within scientific journals. The review includes environmental citizen science apps as a particular example of data collection applications. The comprehensive description of workspace creation for field surveys using ArcGIS Online (Esri, 2019) and Collector for ArcGIS (Esri, 2019a) is presented in this work.

Prior research pointed out that there exist two distinct subpopulations in cities, namely returners and explorers, whose mobility patterns differ in the extent to which their characteristic traveled distance is impacted by their recurrent mobility. However, the potential dependence of the returners and explorers dichotomy on the observation duration has been largely ignored in prior research, which may cause biased understanding of the returners and explorers dichotomy in urban mobility patterns. By analyzing the daily trajectory data of 21,240 individuals in Guangzhou over 111 weekdays, this study evidenced that the returners and explorers dichotomy is significantly dependent on the duration within which individuals’ trajectories are observed. This study further revealed that such dependence could be interpreted by three underlying explanations, which are respectively related to information accumulation, individuals’ spatial exploration behaviors and changes in individuals’ important locations. The findings provide fundamental knowledge for studying urban human mobility patterns for disease prediction, population behavioral modeling, and understanding dynamic human-environment interactions at urban scales.}

In 2014, we conducted a PPGIS study to identify public land values in Victoria, Australia. Over 35,000 landscape value and land use preference locations were mapped by study participants (n = 1905). We analyzed the spatial data for association with public land type, IUCN classification, and an agency level management system. We generated social landscape metrics to quantify values by individual public land units based on value abundance, richness, diversity, and the potential for management conflict. We found statistically significant associations between values and public land type, IUCN protected area classification, and management level of protection. The social landscape metrics indicate that the most highly valued public lands (national parks) have the greatest potential for management conflict, but also reveal several less iconic public lands as having high potential for management conflict. We discuss the strengths and limitations of the PPGIS methods in the study and provide suggestions to improve the process for future assessments of social and cultural values associated with public lands.}

Thus, social media has become a very prominent data source to obtain data and contextual information. Recently, cities are exposed to a variety of challenges such as health care, environment, energy consumption, traffic congestion, housing, education, public safety, budgets, economic development, demographics, diversity, and inclusiveness. So, technological advances bear the promise of addressing many of these challenges. At this point, the feedback from the citizens and city inhabitants is needed to collaborate voluntarily with observations about their surrounding environment. Thus, the technology plays an important role to offer solutions essentially fostering the civic participation. This chapter is focused on examining this particular issue, taking into consideration data from social media that can assist governments and organizations to better understand various phenomena massively and nearly to real time. A framework for urban analysis based on civic participation is proposed, in which social media posts are used to explicitly describe geographic features and events as well as spatial relationships that include time stamps and geolocation data. On the other hand, to highlight the advantage of the framework, a geographic information system–approach is considered, emphasizing aspects related to the data quality, where the diversity of criteria applied by users in the data acquisition is presented. As a case study, Twitter was chosen as the social media for its common use in scientific and commercial data analysis.}

Such financial tools are intended to promote fast payouts in the aftermath of a disastrous event. They leverage on measured hazard parameters, gathered immediately after the event and defined as the trigger(s), which are used to identify such hazardous events and estimate their resulting consequences in terms of physical damage and losses. This paper addresses the first step of such a modeling approach, the detection of a flood event, which plays an important role in the overall methodology, determining its performance in terms of false and missed detections. Different types of triggers for identifying flood events, based on satellite precipitation estimates, are investigated, and the overall model performance is assessed for a case-study country (the Philippines). A statistical procedure for selecting the optimal configuration of model parameters is presented. Such an optimal configuration minimizes the so-called basis risk, defined in this study as the mismatch between modeled and actual events. Finally, the accuracy of the proposed approach in terms of event localization is investigated by subdividing the case-study country into three main areas, corresponding to the coarsest administrative levels, and assessing the model's capability to capture events in each considered area. The results from this study confirm that the proposed SPEED model can be effectively used as an input for parametric insurance products, given its ability to identify hazardous events correctly.}

A dearth of national-scale assessments in the Global South has precluded the ability to explore how political regimes, such as the forced racial segregation in South Africa during and after Apartheid, have influenced the extent of and access to green infrastructure over time. We investigate whether there are disparities in green infrastructure distributions across race and income geographies in urban South Africa. Using open-source satellite imagery and geographic information, along with national census statistics, we find that public and private green infrastructure is more abundant, accessible, greener and more treed in high-income relative to low-income areas, and in areas where previously advantaged racial groups (i.e. White citizens) reside. Areas with White residents report 6-fold higher income, have 11.7% greater tree cover, 8.9% higher vegetation greenness and live 700 m closer to a public park than areas with predominantly Black African, Indian, and Coloured residents. The inequity in neighborhood greenness levels has been maintained (for Indian and Coloured areas) and further entrenched (for Black African areas) since the end of Apartheid in 1994 across the country. We also find that these spatial inequities are mirrored in both private (gardens) and public (street verges, parks, green belts) spaces, hinting at the failure of governance structures to plan for and implement urban greening initiatives. By leveraging open-access satellite data and methods presented here, there is scope for civil society to monitor urban green infrastructure over time and thereby hold governments accountable to addressing environmental justice imperatives in the future.

Many programs are ill-equipped to effectively manage these data. We examined the art and science of multi-scale citizen science support, focusing on issues of integration and flexibility that arise for data management when programs span multiple spatial, temporal, and social scales across many domains. Our objectives were to: (1) briefly review existing citizen science approaches and data management needs; (2) propose a framework for multi-scale citizen science support; (3) develop a cyber-infrastructure to support citizen science program needs; and (4) describe lessons learned. We find that approaches differ in scope, scale, and activities and that the proposed framework situates programs while guiding cyber-infrastructure system development. We built a cyber-infrastructure support system for citizen science programs (www.citsci.org) and show that carefully designed systems can be adept enough to support programs at multiple spatial and temporal scales across many domains when built with a flexible architecture. The advantage of a flexible, yet controlled, cyber-infrastructure system lies in the ability of users with different levels of permission to easily customize the features themselves, while adhering to controlled vocabularies necessary for cross-discipline comparisons and meta-analyses. Program evaluation tied to this framework and integrated into cyber-infrastructure support systems will improve our ability to track effectiveness. We compare existing systems and discuss the importance of standards for interoperability and the challenges associated with system maintenance and long-term support. We conclude by offering a vision of the future of citizen science data management and cyber-infrastructure support.}

abstract = {Sinkholes are one of the major geohazards in karst areas, causing loss of life and significant economic loss as well. Sinkhole forming mechanism varies depending on the geological environment, and Florida's sinkholes are formed through the process of interaction between groundwater flow and cover soils. The significance of this paper is (1) to identify key sinkhole contributing factors and (2) to quantify the impact of those factors on sinkhole formation. Particularly, this study accounted for geomechanical factors that contribute to sinkhole raveling (due to erosion) and mechanical stability of overburden soils. Identification of key sinkhole contributing factors will allow developing a probabilistic sinkhole prediction model. The study area was focused on East Central Florida, where cover-collapse sinkholes often occur. Uniform-distribution transformation was employed for the quantitative analysis on each factor, and then case studies with specific examples are then presented to validate the results of the quantitative analysis. In conclusion, the identified key factors are hydraulic head difference, soil permeability, thicknesses of aquifer systems, and proximity to karst features (e.g., existing sinkhole). The critical permeability (kcrit) showing a rapid increase of sinkhole occurrence is about 20 cm/h. Thickness and characteristics of cover soils seem a controlling factor of sinkhole types, and the overburden thickness around 40 to 45 m tends to form the collapse type. A multivariate regression analysis indicates that the thickness of the surficial aquifer system is the most significant factor, and then the head difference and the proximity to karst features follow in order.}

With the aim to reduce future impacts from natural disasters it is crucial to understand the variability in space and time of the vulnerability of people and economic assets. In this paper we quantified the temporal dynamics of socio-economic vulnerability, expressed as fatalities over exposed population and losses over exposed GDP, to climate-related hazards between 1980 and 2016. Using a global, spatially explicit framework that integrates population and economic dynamics with one of the most complete natural disaster loss databases we quantified mortality and loss rates across income levels and analyzed their relationship with wealth. Results show a clear decreasing trend in both human and economic vulnerability, with global average mortality and economic loss rates that have dropped by 6.5 and nearly 5 times, respectively, from 1980–1989 to 2007–2016. We further show a clear negative relation between vulnerability and wealth, which is strongest at the lowest income levels. This has led to a convergence in vulnerability between higher and lower income countries. Yet, there is still a considerable climate hazard vulnerability gap between poorer and richer countries.}

Crowdsourcing and social media are widely used in disaster response, yet their primary implementation and application are often via non-governmental agencies and private citizens. A review of the literature suggests that government emergency management agencies in Canada have made little documented progress in adopting crowdsourcing or social media for emergency management. Most of the literature around crowdsourcing and social media for emergency management focus on its use or role outside of Canada (e.g. the USA, Australia, etc.). In order for government agencies in Canada to progress, it is important to identify the Canada-specific barriers and constraints. This study offers a new perspective from Canadian government emergency management agencies to address this gap. Through a series of semi-structured interviews with 15 government officials from 14 agencies, this study identifies the primary challenges and constraints faced by Canadian agencies looking to adopt crisis crowdsourcing. Results indicate that organizational factors, policies, and federal legislation in Canada present barriers to crisis crowdsourcing (including crowdsourcing through social media) adoption within agencies at various levels of government. Based on these results, recommendations are made to support the adoption of crisis crowdsourcing amongst Canadian government agencies.}

The urban form influences and is influenced by these flows and is therefore critical in understanding and how urban areas affect and are affected by form. Nevertheless, there is a lack of uniformity in how urban form is analyzed. Urban form analyzed from a continuum of a simple urban versus non-urban classification to highly detailed representations of land use and land cover. Either end of the representation spectrum limits the ability to analyze within-urban dynamics, to make cross-city comparisons, and to produce generalizable results. In the framework of remote sensing and geospatial analysis, we identify and define six fundamental aspects of urban form, which are organized within three overarching components. Materials, or the physical elements of the urban landscape, consists of three aspects (1) human constructed elements, (2) the soil-plant continuum, and (3) water elements. The second component is configuration, which includes the (4) two- and three-dimensional space and (5) spatial pattern of urban areas. Lastly, because of the dynamics of human activities and biophysical processes, an important final component is the change of urban form over (6) time. We discuss how a this urban form framework integrates into a broader discussion of urbanization.}

In many cases, data used for these purposes have low spatial and temporal resolution, or sample size. Equally, comprehensive analytical approaches suitable for these data may be lacking. We present a statistical method borrowed from wildlife ecology and management called a resource selection function (RSF). We apply it to answer questions relating to the selection of urban green space by university students, using a dataset consisting of smartphone GPS location data volunteered by participants. We ask questions relating to urban greenspace selection by comparing used locations to a set of random locations at multiple spatial extents. We found that participants altered their selection of areas according to the surrounding recreational trail density and whether those areas were classified as green space. These relationships were also influenced by season. Our study also demonstrates how the design of an urban RSF can offer different insights by varying the extent of the domain: (1) to an individual’s core area; or (2) by excluding from the domain areas that are physically unavailable. We emphasize the importance of matching availability to the research question and conclude by reviewing the opportunities presented by using RSFs combined with GPS location data in an urban context. We argue that RSFs have utility beyond wildlife ecology and management, and, given the increasing availability of smartphone GPS data, can successfully be applied to determine the use and selection of spaces by urban residents.}

Disaster evacuation drills are one of the important soft countermeasures to ensure proper response when a real tsunami arrives. With the goal of enhancing the traditional evacuation drill, this study developed a mobile application prototype to be used as an educational tool in a drill exercise. The mobile application retrieves the current location of the user and shows the inundation depth of the 2011 Great East Japan tsunami, together with the map, latitude, and longitude. Experiments were conducted in the town of Matsushima and the city of Iwanuma in Miyagi Prefecture, Japan, to investigate the effect of using the information provided. These locations were affected by the 2011 tsunami. The results revealed a change in the behavior and decision making of the participants, who considered the inundation depth of their evacuation route and the safety of their chosen destination. This application does not require complex techniques; thus, teachers, drill executors, and community leaders can follow this strategy to enhance their tsunami evacuation drills using mobile devices.}

Consequently, for such a case, information about each individual destination on a more detailed spatial level is needed. This information can be gathered manually or, if available, through the classical approach from public authorities. However, these approaches are often time consuming and expensive. An alternative way is to gather the information automatically from open data portals. Open-StreetMap (OSM) is such an open data portal driven by volunteers. The data is publicly available, but as volunteers provide it, the quality of the data is not controlled by a single instance. Therefore, we analyze the potential and risks of using OSM as a data source for microscopic destination choice models. Our analysis took place in the city of Karlsruhe. We analyzed the available information for destinations regarding the education and work activity type. Our analysis is split into two parts. Firstly, we analyzed the trend of the information available on OSM over the last years. Secondly, we compared the currently available information for one area of Karlsruhe. By comparing OSM data with manually gathered data, we show that for the education activity type, OSM data is suitable to determine location attributes, whereas, for the work activity type, OSM data is still lacking and therefore not suitable to determine location attributes.}

However, such areas, due to the high population density, sub-standard housing and lack of essential services are urban risks. The socio-physical development of such settlements has often been neglected due to poor laws and provisions in urban management and policies. One of the primary reasons for negligence has been the unavailability of slum maps to study the evolution of slums and to actively manage and contain them. Various remote sensing techniques have been utilized to answer the problem but have not produced universal solutions. In recent years, Deep Learning (DL) techniques with remote sensing have been found beneficial in comprehending the underlying structure of physical features present in the satellite imageries. This study deals with one of the Deep Learning techniques which use pre-trained convolutional networks for slum detection in Very High Resolution (VHR) and Medium Resolution (MR) satellite imagery. We created a training dataset which comprises of four classes including slums, built, green and water. We further trained the model to detect these classes in the entire city. Classification performance was evaluated for Very high and Medium Resolution imagery with the help of manually delineated slum boundaries gathered from urban local authorities of Mumbai. The Overall accuracy of 94.2 and 90.2 and kappa of 0.70 and 0.55 is obtained from VHR and MR imagery respectively. We provide a comprehensive technique for the detection of informal settlements which can be tailored and applied to any city to detect various landforms.}

These need to be of global scope, of sufficient spatial and temporal resolution, and generated with transparent, consistent methods. This study develops the methods and applies it to generate these datasets at subnational and hourly resolution. The assessment is carried out for wind and solar technologies with consistent constraints including geographical, social and economic aspects. Features from the OpenStreetMap are converted into land cover and land use datasets and applied. Hourly energy output is simulated using NASA MERRA-2 meteorological datasets, reconciled with resource maps from the Global Wind Atlas and Global Solar Atlas platforms. Capacity supply curves are provided for 731 terrestrial zones and 339 offshore zones worldwide, along with corresponding hourly output profiles over a 10-year simulation period. The proposed energy potentials are relative conservative compared with other studies. The datasets can serve as input for regional or global energy system models when analyzing high variable renewable energy shares.}

We use the Weka and ARIES software to produce two examples of DDM: firewood use in South Africa and biodiversity value in Sicily, respectively. Our South African example demonstrates that DDM (64–91% accuracy) can identify the areas where firewood use is within the top quartile with comparable accuracy as conventional modelling techniques (54–77% accuracy). The Sicilian example highlights how DDM can be made more accessible to decision makers, who show both capacity and willingness to engage with uncertainty information. Uncertainty estimates, produced as part of the DDM process, allow decision makers to determine what level of uncertainty is acceptable to them and to use their own expertise for potentially contentious decisions. We conclude that DDM has a clear role to play when modelling ecosystem services, helping produce interdisciplinary models and holistic solutions to complex socio-ecological issues.}

Hence an advanced tool is required to filter such massive data and mine the valuable information. Recommender systems are among the most excellent tools for such a purpose in which collaborative filtering is widely used. Collaborative filtering (CF) has been extensively utilized to offer personalized recommendations in electronic business and social network websites. In that, matrix factorization is an efficient technique; however, it depends on past transactions of the users. Hence, there will be a data sparsity problem. Another issue with the collaborative filtering method is the cold start issue, which is due to the deficient information about new entities. A novel method is proposed to overcome the data sparsity and the cold start problem in CF. For cold start issue, Recommender System with Linked Open Data (RS-LOD) model is designed and for data sparsity problem, Matrix Factorization model with Linked Open Data is developed (MF-LOD). A LOD knowledge base “DBpedia” is used to find enough information about new entities for a cold start issue, and an improvement is made on the matrix factorization model to handle data sparsity. Experiments were done on Netflix and MovieLens datasets show that our proposed techniques are superior to other existing methods, which mean recommendation accuracy is improved.}

In this study, we developed a framework to assess disaster impacts with social media data, and examined the potential of information extraction with social media messages from Weibo platform to inform disaster response and recovery in China, using the case of 2016 Wuhan rainstorm and flood disaster. Temporal evolution of social media activities was investigated to track the process of the disaster, and further compared with observed precipitation data. Moreover, major impacts of the disaster were assessed through word frequency analysis of impact-related topics. Finally, place-related information were extracted to map the hotspots of the disaster. The results indicate that temporal variation of social media activities was consistent with the rainstorm process and significant positive correlation was found between social media activities and precipitation intensity. Word frequency analysis of impact-related topics revealed that transportation and daily life were most affected, meanwhile impacts on people's emotion and psychological activities were also notable. For hot spots affected by the disaster, more flooded sites were found in central urban districts, which are generally residential/industrial area or roads and other traffic-related places. This study demonstrated the utility of social media for disaster assessment, however ensuring the accuracy of online information and expanding the application for all phases of disaster management still pose substantial challenges for future research.}

Peer-to-peer accommodation platforms are a cornerstone of smart cities and the sharing economy; their impact on place and placemaking is still largely untested, with evidence that an indiscriminate commercial focus on tourism growth can affect the habitability of cities and the quality of public space. This chapter presents a critical assessment to rethink the impact that peer-to-peer accommodation networks have on place experiences and placemaking, focusing on three themes: (a) the urban ecosystem, (b) place authenticity and “localhood,” and (c) a city’s diversity advantage. As a way to illustrate our argument and to ground it in an empirical case, we introduce firsthand place and tourism experiences from the city of Split in Croatia. We synthesize our argument across the three themes with a view to expand transdisciplinary knowledge into urban studies and smart cities. The chapter concludes with emerging recommendations for placemaking approaches, policy, and regulatory reform as well as industry and platform innovation.}

abstract = {The quality of a location-based social network (LBSN) is mainly related to the granularity of information on the users' location. When LBSN is built using stay points, it presents much more information since GPS logs convey more users' mobility information. However, the main challenge in building LBSN using stay points is to define local-vertices. This problem is known as local-entity resolution. This local-vertices could represent venues with semantic information like parks, restaurants, among others. The most common way to resolve local-entity is by applying clustering algorithms to group nearby stay points into local-vertices. However, in this case, only geographic information is used, which makes it very difficult to separate geographically close venues into distinct local-vertices. This paper addresses this gap and presents a novel approach that uses the coarsening stage of a multilevel optimization scheme to build LBSNs by using stay points. The experimental evaluation carried out indicates that our approach has advantages compared to usual clustering methods to represent real-world features.}

However, the emotional information may contain biases as users are a particular subset of the whole population. This research studies whether there are significant differences between place emotion extracted from SNS and the place in-situ (a campus of Wuhan University). Two datasets from different sources, Weibo (a platform similar to twitter) and in-situ cameras, are collected over the same time periods in the same geographical range. By utilizing online cognitive services on the photos collected, the diversity of people with a recognizable face in terms of age, gender, and emotions are determined. The results suggest that there are significant differences in place emotion extracted from Weibo and in-situ. Furthermore, the pattern of differences varies among diverse demographic groups. This paper quantitatively contrasts place emotion extracted from SNS and the place in-situ, which can help researchers achieve a more profound understanding of human behavior differences between online and offline place emotion. This research also provides a theoretical basis to calibrate the emotion metrics obtained from SNS facial expressions on future place emotion studies.}

With the growing amount of data, there is little doubt that a potentially wider community can benefit from open access to them. Additionally, open data add to the transparency of research and can be considered as an essential feature of science. However, data anonymization is a complex task and the unique characteristics of PPGIS add to this complexity. PPGIS data often include personal spatial and non-spatial information, which essentially require different approaches for anonymization. In this study, we first identify different privacy concerns and then develop a PPGIS data anonymization strategy to overcome them for an open PPGIS data. Specifically, this article introduces a context-sensitive spatial anonymization method to protect individual home locations while maintaining their spatial resolution for mapping purposes. Furthermore, this study empirically evaluates the effects of data anonymization on PPGIS data quality. The results indicate that a satisfactory level of anonymization can be reached using this approach. Moreover, the assessment results indicate that the environmental and home range measurements as well as their intercorrelations are not significantly biased by the anonymization. However, necessary analytical measures such as use of larger spatial units is recommendable when anonymized data is used. In this study, European data protection regulations were used as the legal guidelines. However, adaptation of methods employed in this study may be also relevant to other countries where comparable regulations exist. Although specifically targeted at PPGIS data, what is discussed in this paper can be applicable to other similar spatial datasets as well.}

We compare several pre-processing schemes (PS) for LUCAS data and propose a new PS for a fully automated classification of satellite imagery on the national level. The image data utilizes a high-dimensional Sentinel-2-based image feature space. Key elements of LUCAS data pre-processing include two positioning approaches and three semantic selection approaches. The latter approaches differ in the applied quality measures for identifying valid reference points and by the number of LU/LC classes (7–12). In an iterative training process, the impact of the chosen PS on a Random Forest image classifier is evaluated. The results are compared to LUCAS reference points that are not pre-processed, which act as a benchmark, and the classification quality is evaluated by independent sets of validation points. The classification results show that the positional correction of LUCAS points has an especially positive effect on the overall classification accuracy. On average, this improves the accuracy by 3.7%. This improvement is lowest for the most rigid sample selection approach, PS2, and highest for the benchmark data set, PS0. The highest overall accuracy is 93.1% which is achieved by using the newly developed PS3; all PS achieve overall accuracies of 80% and higher on average. While the difference in overall accuracy between the PS is likely to be influenced by the respective number of LU/LC classes, we conclude that, overall, LUCAS in-situ data is a suitable source for reference information for large scale high resolution LC mapping using Sentinel-2 imagery. Existing sample selection approaches developed for Landsat imagery can be transferred to Sentinel-2 imagery, achieving comparable semantic accuracies while increasing the spatial resolution. The resulting LC classification product that uses the newly developed PS is available for Germany via DOI: https://doi.org/10.15489/1ccmlap3mn39.}

abstract = {The Lesser Sunda Seascape (LSS) is considered one of the regions with the largest mobulid fisheries in Indonesia, although their spatial distribution and habitat preference in the LSS is still largely unknown. The goal of the present study was to describe the habitat preference and distribution of the oceanic manta rays, spinetail devil rays, and Chilean devil rays in the coastal area of LSS. We used multiple data sources of mobulid ray sightings and selected significant environmental predictors to execute the maximum entropy model. The model performed well in predicting mobulid ray habitat in the coastal area of LSS and indicated that sea-surface chlorophyll-a (SSC-a), sea-surface temperature (SST), sea-surface salinity (SSS), distance to the 200-m isobath, distance to the 3000-m isobath, and slope were all significant environmental predictors of their distribution. This study confirms that the habitat preference of mobulid rays were in the areas that close to the 200-m isobath and with higher chlorophyll-a concentration as proxy for their prey density. Combining habitat models with fisheries activity records indicated that the areas where these overlaps may represent key mobulid habitats. This study highlights a critical need for species-specific and populations-level management measures for Indonesian mobulid rays, whereas current MPA design has focused on a broad-scale coastal ecosystem management approach, which may have limited effectiveness in practice. This study provides valuable information for the improvement of MPA design and fisheries management tools, through maximum entropy modeling as a powerful means to describe species’ distributions and habitat preference. We recommend that future efforts focus on documenting and incorporating data from large-scale commercial fisheries to improve our knowledge of habitat preference and distribution models in offshore areas and the high seas, and to assess the preference for coastal versus oceanic habitats.}

abstract = {Irrespective of the magnitude and spatial extend, the consequences of a natural hazard are strongly connected to the vulnerability of elements at risk (e.g. people, buildings and infrastructure). It is, therefore, obvious that an analysis and quantification of vulnerability is required for successful disaster risk reduction. The need for vulnerability assessment is crucial due to the effects of climate change as well as the socio-economic dynamics that may directly impact vulnerabilities and coping capacities of affected communities. Vulnerability is multidimensional (physical, social, economic, etc.), however, the dimension which is mainly related to the direct costs and threat to human lives is the physical one. We focus here on the physical vulnerability of buildings subject to torrential hazards occurring in small and steep mountain catchments. These processes include fluvial sediment transport, debris floods, and debris flows. Furthermore, we included flash flood hazards if these are related to torrential catchments. Physical vulnerability to torrential hazards in mountain areas is a topic that has been under scientific investigation over the last 20 years. Several methods to assess physical vulnerability of buildings towards flash floods, debris flows and hyper-concentrated flows can be found in the literature. The plethora of methods and approaches may be classified under the following three categories: vulnerability matrices, vulnerability curves and vulnerability indices. We provide a short review of these methods which became available over the last decade and which dominate the scientific debate in mountain hazard risk management, giving an emphasis to vulnerability curves. The approaches presented herein are highlighted through case studies from the European Alps and beyond. Furthermore, challenges in vulnerability assessment including data requirements, need for improved event documentation, uncertainties and challenges related to future climate and socio-economic changes are outlined. Finally, a discussion on progress-driving factors such as new technologies (e.g. mobile apps, drones), citizen science and new innovative assessment methods is provided.}

Anticipating when and where both biophysical and cultural ES will be affected by these two types of coastal environmental change is critical for sustainable land-use planning and management. Biophysical (provisioning and regulating) services can be mapped using secondary data. We demonstrate an approach to mapping cultural ES by engaging stakeholders in iterative participatory mapping of personally and communally valuable cultural ES. We identify hotspots where highly valued cultural ES and high values for biophysical ES co-occur and generate spatially-explicit projections of sea level rise and urban expansion through 2060 to quantify impacts of the ‘coastal squeeze’ on ES. We study Johns Island, South Carolina, USA as an example of a vulnerable community in a low-lying region experiencing both rising water levels and a rapid influx of new residents and development. Our projections of environmental change through 2060 indicate that on Johns Island, cultural ES face disproportionately greater risk of decline than biophysical ES, with almost three quarters of the island’s cultural ES affected. We find that hotspots for cultural ES, such as community heritage sites and scenic vistas of oak-lined roads and marshes, rarely co-occur (only 3% area) with biophysical ES such as high values of carbon sequestration and agricultural production. This confirms the importance of engaging with local stakeholders to map cultural ES and puts them on a more level playing field with biophysical ES in decision-making contexts. Projected declines and limited overlap between biophysical and cultural ES highlight the need for tighter coordination between conservation and community planning, and for including locally valued cultural ES in assessments of threats posed by the ‘coastal squeeze’ of sea level rise and urban expansion.}

Building upon the increasing narrative of digital social participation that describes crowdsourcing processes as short ways towards democratisation of public decision-making processes, our research describes the trends and threats associated with the “hyperconnected city” imaginary advanced by (part of) scholarly research and EC policy documents and projects. We show how, while these last describe digital-supported participation processes as (at least potentially) able to bootstrap an open governance agenda, local urban initiatives suggest the need to question this technology-optimistic imaginary. A critical analysis of crowdsourcing for public governance prototyped and piloted in some European cities makes it evident that at local level, alternative imaginaries are emerging. We describe them in this paper as the “receptive city” (often adopted by public institutions and administration), and the “do-it-yourself city” (referring to the critical perspective of (digital) social activists) imaginaries, both emerging from local-based experiences and debates; and clarify their convergence and divergence how these differs from the above-mentioned “hyperconnected city” imaginary prefigured by EC guidelines. The conclusive section further expands the analysis prefiguring future research possibilities promises in terms of local experiences influencing the future internet for society and digital agenda for Europe.}

In existing methods, the computation overheads grow rapidly with data volumes, leading to the incapability of providing real-time visualization for large-scale spatial vector data, even with parallel acceleration technologies. To fill the gap, we present HiVision, a display-driven visualization model for large-scale spatial vector data. Different from traditional data-driven methods, the computing units in HiVision are pixels rather than spatial objects to achieve real-time performance, and efficient spatial-index-based strategies are introduced to estimate the topological relationships between pixels and spatial objects. HiVision can maintain exceedingly good performance regardless of the data volume due to the stable pixel number for display. In addition, an optimized parallel computing architecture is proposed in HiVision to ensure the ability of real-time visualization. Experiments show that our approach outperforms traditional methods in rendering speed and visual effects while dealing with large-scale spatial vector data, and can provide interactive visualization of datasets with billion-scale points/segments/edges in real-time with flexible rendering styles. The HiVision code is open-sourced at https://github.com/MemoryMmy/HiVision with an online demonstration.}

The census and the municipal basemaps and orthophotos were overlaid in a Geographic Information System (GIS) to evaluate their similarities and differences, the reasons for inconsistencies between them. Of the 68 districts with subnormal agglomerates (EDSAs; special enumeration districts for slum areas in the Brazilian demographic census), 59% are in the categories ‘high coincidence’ or ‘partial coincidence’ with the perimeters of favelas (the main type of slum in Brazil) delineated by the Sao Paulo municipal government; the names of the residential area (favela/EDSA) are the same in only 51.5% of the subnormal agglomerates, while 26.5% of the EDSAs include residential areas not considered favelas by the municipality. Many Brazilian researchers state that the underestimation of EDSA census data is accentuated by the exclusion of favelas smaller than 51 dwellings from the census. However, at least in Sao Mateus, the exclusion of small favelas (3.6%) was not the only reason for census underestimation of favelas.}

To improve soil erosion sampling survey methods and accurately and rapidly estimate the actual rates of soil erosion, a Pan-Third Pole region was taken as an example to study a methodology of soil erosion sampling survey based on high-spatial-resolution remote sensing images. The sampling units were designed using a stratified variable probability systematic sampling method. The spatiotemporal characteristics of soil erosion and conservation were taken into account, and finer-resolution freely available and accessible images in Google Earth were used. Through the visual interpretation of the free high-resolution remote sensing images, detailed information on land use and soil conservation measures was obtained. Then, combined with the regional soil erosion factor data products, such as rainfall-runoff erosivity factor (R), soil erodibility factor (K), and slope length and steepness factor (LS), the soil loss rates of some sampling units were calculated. The results show that, based on these high-resolution remote sensing images, the land use and soil conservation measures of the sampling units can be quickly and accurately extracted. The interpretation accuracy in 4 typical cross sections was more than 80%, and sampling accuracy, described by histogram similarity in 11 large sampling sites, show that the landuse of sampling uints can represent the structural characteristics of regional land use. Based on the interpretation of data from the sample survey and the regional soil erosion factor data products, the calculation of the soil erosion rate can be completed quickly. The calculation results can reflect the actual conditions of soil erosion better than the potential soil erosion rates calculated by using the coarse-resolution remote sensing method.}

abstract = {Detailed information on plant developmental stages, referred as phenological phases, can assist research, applications and synergies e.g., in land use, climate science and remote sensing. Usually, detailed ground information about phenological phases is only available as point observations. However, in most application scenarios of spatially interpolated phenological information is required. In this article, we present an approach for modeling and interpolation of crop phenological phases in temperate climates on the example of the total area of Germany using statistical analysis and a Kriging prediction process. The presented model consists of two major parts. First, daily temperature observations are spatially interpolated to retrieve a countrywide temperature data set. Second, this temperature information is linked to the day of year on which a phenological event was observed by a governmental observation network. The accumulated temperature sum between sowing and observed phenological events is calculated. The day on which the temperature sum on any location exceeds a phase-specific critical temperature sum, which indicates the day of entry of the modeled phase, is finally interpolated to retrieve a countrywide data set of a specific phenological phase. The model was applied on the example of eight agricultural species including cereals, maize and root crops and 37 corresponding phases in 2011. The results for most of the tested crops and phases show significantly lower root mean squared errors (RMSE) values and higher goodness of fit (R2) values compared to results computed using Ordinary Kriging (OK) and Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW). The modeling accuracy varies between 2.14days and 11.45days for heading and emergence of winter wheat, respectively. The uncertainty of the majority of the modeled phases is less than a week. The model is universally applicable due to automatic parametrization, but model accuracies depend on the crop type and increase during a growing season. The possibility to enhance the model by additional explaining variables is demonstrated by consideration of soil moisture within an extended model setting.}

Combining biosensing with other techniques allows insights to be generated not only about the intensity of somatic response but also, crucially, the underlying causes of that response. Despite pioneering work in this area, a rigorous, empirically-led analysis of biosensing measures in mixed methods research has hitherto been lacking. We address this lacuna through a case study of urban walking, comparing a field-based study (30 participants) with a virtual exercise undertaken in a lab (25 participants). Combining biosensing with data on environmental stimuli (recorded using video/GPS) and interviews, three analytical modes are examined: biosensing-led; environment-led; and thematic-led. The analysis shows how each dataset can add contextualizing information to significant phenomena observed in the others. We demonstrate, however, that biosensing measures become considerably more difficult to interpret beyond the controlled environment of the lab. The paper concludes that biosensing should be seen as a valuable measure in field studies, but one which requires careful interpretation through other datasets, being of limited usefulness and reliability taken alone.}

abstract = {In the information era, cities are connected by data networks and, therefore, solutions to urban problems have been supported by Information and Communication Technologies, which provide the interaction between government and citizens. Thus, information plays a crucial role in Smart Cities, enabling the smart governance, under the precepts of good governance, highlighting the participation and transparency. In addition, Geoinformation turns the Multipurpose Territorial Cadastre into a decision support informational source that is of great relevance in the context of Smart Governance. Based on this context, the present study investigates the geotechnology scenario applied by the governments of the Brazilian capitals, observing the availability of Multipurpose Territorial Cadastre on the Internet and considering the Geoinformation, Transparency and Collaborative participation aspects. In this sense, this paper proposes an exploratory research, with quantitative and qualitative analyzes. In the first stage, it was identified the cities that offer access to territorial information via the Internet, i.e., quantifying cities with active geoportals. Next, the second step qualifies the geoportals of cities according to their existence and access to certain information. The types of information selected for the survey, considered the evolution of the Cadastre, observing three aspects: (i) cadastral information; (ii) thematic information; and (iii) collaborative interface. The results showed that just over half of the capitals keep active geoportals and almost 1/3 of the capitals make available on the Internet a Multipurpose Territorial Cadastre. In terms of Transparency, it was noted that open access data is still lower than non-available or restricted access data. Moreover, the aspect of Collaborative participation is meaningless. Analyzing the results, it can be noted the need to improve both the availability of data and open access to information regarding the aspects of Multipurpose Territorial Cadastre in the geoportals, mainly the cadastral information. These actions could promote the transparency and collaborative participation that, consequently, will improve the effectiveness of smart governance in the Brazilian capitals.}

abstract = {Group recommendation has attracted researchers’ attention in various domains, specifically such approaches utilizing location-based social networks (LBSNs). However, point of interest (POI) group recommendation faces the challenge of aggregating diverse user preferences, while group members have different influences on the final decision of the group. Besides, the recommendation of spatial items is different from non-spatial items and the unique features of the spatial items such as distance must be considered in the recommendation. In this paper, a POI group recommendation method is proposed to tackle this problem. User influence is modeled fuzzy and taken into account the difference of users’ personality and their preferences when are alone or in a group, by using historical check-in data in LBSNs and in terms of category, distance and time. The proposed method is integrated with the weighted average aggregation to improve the efficiency of the POI group recommendation. Experimental results in a real dataset show improvement in the accuracy of POI group recommendations in varying sizes of groups. The results also get better when the user influence is calculated using the fuzzy approach. Besides, studying user behavior differences to choose the place to visit when alone or in a group shows that i) the flexibility of users in distance is less than time and category. It is also in the category less than time. ii) Time has a greater range of behavioral change than distance and category. iii) Users who actively participate in group decision making have a more significant number of visits in groups than when they are alone.}

Our analysis shows support for the use of geotagged social media to supplement data collected through traditional means (e.g., on-site counts of visitors) as part of visitor use monitoring protocols. However, we did observe notable differences in the amount of variance in reported visitation explained by geotagged social media. Social media posts made within national parks and national forests captured substantially more of the variation in reported visitation relative to posts made within state parks. We attribute this to a variety of factors including the unique types of sites managed within the state park system, lower levels of visitation relative to national parks and forests within the state, and the method by which the state estimates visitation. We use exploratory spatial analyses to investigate spatial patterns of visitation across public lands. The analysis, performed at three different spatial scales (statewide, region, and county) illustrate the diversity of ways in which geotagged social media can inform outdoor recreation and tourism planning efforts and supplement traditional methods of measuring visitation. Our investigation demonstrates how social media can serve as a useful tool to inform proactive planning and management efforts.}

The use of these two separate efforts needs to be harmonized so that geospatial information does not remain an isolated area on the Web. Motivated by several domain use cases, we synthesize a list of provenance questions and analyze gaps between the two models in addressing these questions. Our strategy is to enrich W3C PROV with domain semantics from the ISO 19115 lineage model by suggesting ways to bridge them. A semantic mapping between the ISO lineage model and the W3C PROV model is formalized, and key issues involved are discussed. Use cases illustrate the applicability of the approach.}

abstract = {The development of 3D property registration systems is indispensable for the spatial determination of property Rights, Restrictions and Responsibilities (RRR), the sustainable operation of property markets and the safeguarding of ownership in the highly urbanized world. Several developments in computer graphics, 3D modelling and rendering techniques have attracted the growing global interest in 3D cadastre. Since 2012, the Land Administration Domain Model (LADM ISO 19152) is adopted as the international standard for 2D and 3D cadastral data modelling. Developed legal procedures and prototype systems for 3D property rights registration provide interesting solutions for data acquisition and visualization but such approaches are time and cost demanding. In parallel, 2D cadastral surveying procedures have progressed significantly in reducing required time and cost, utilizing crowdsourcing methodology and mobile services. This paper presents a technical solution under development, aiming to provide the beginning for a new era in the initial acquisition, registration and representation of 3D crowdsourced cadastral data, appropriate for both the developed and the developing world. The proposed solution consists of two complementary parts, the technical framework and the crowdsourced methodology to be followed. The technical framework consists of two interconnected parts, the server-side and the client-side. The server-side refers to the Database Management System (DBMS) where the collected data are stored. The client-side refers to the data capturing tool, which in this case is the mobile device. For the server-side, a prototype system based on model driven architecture practices and LADM is developed; while for the client-side, an open-source mobile application for the acquisition of 3D crowdsourced cadastral data, 3D modelling and visualization of 3D property units as block models (LoD1) on a mobile’s phone screen in real-time, is developed. This research is focused on investigating technical aspects for capturing and integrating data about legal rights on physical objects. Detailed investigation of legal issues is not within the objectives of this research. Two case-studies for testing the proposed technical solution are made. An assessment of the current stage of development of the technical solution is presented. The main conclusions converge that the proposed technical solution has huge potentials for the fast, economic implementation of 3D cadastral surveys as it can produce an accurate and reliable 3D information model, depending on the accuracy of the available basemaps. The developed application is easy-to-use as users may not have the necessary level of 3D modelling skills in order to contribute to the registration procedure.}

The results showed that hot grids are primarily clustered along the main street through the downtown area during working days, whereas cold grids are often observed at the edge of the city during the weekend. The mixed use (of commercial and life services, restaurants and snack bars, offices, leisure areas and sports complexes) is the most significant contributing factor. A new cold grid emerged near conference venues before the Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa Summit, revealing the strong effects of regulations on population dynamics and its evolving patterns. This study demonstrates that the proposed data-driven framework might offer new insights into urban population dynamics and its driving mechanism in support of sustainable urban development.}

Crowdsourcing is a novel approach to gathering information, encouraging innovation and facilitating group decision-making. Unfortunately, although previous research has explored the utility of crowdsourcing applied to urban planning theoretically, there are still rare real practices or empirical studies using practical data. This study aims to identify the prospects for implementing crowdsourcing in urban planning through a bibliometric analysis on current research. First, database and keyword lists based on peer-reviewed journal articles were developed. Second, semantic analysis is applied to quantify co-occurrence frequencies of various terms in the articles based on the keyword lists, and in turn a semantic network is built. Then, cluster analysis was conducted to identify major and correlated research topics, and bursting key terms were analyzed and explained chronologically. Lastly, future research and practical trends were discussed. The major contribution of this study is identifying crowdsourcing as a novel urban planning method, which can strengthen government capacities by involving public participation, i.e., turning governments into task givers. Regarding future patterns, the application of crowdsourcing in urban planning is expected to expand to transportation, public health and environmental issues. It is also indicated that the use of crowdsourcing requires governments to adjust urban planning mechanisms.}

Our efforts aimed mostly at identifying and mapping public facilities, and planned and under-construction public works. This research aims to show the potential contribution of such tools to planning informal settlements and creating locally-produced spatial information.

The social vulnerability index (SoVI) has equipped extensive efforts to assess social vulnerability over the past two decades. However, only a few studies have paid attention to the intra-city level social vulnerability, and knowledge gaps still exist in understanding the spatial patterns of urban social vulnerability. This paper presents a hierarchical pattern of urban social vulnerability by a SoVI assessment of the 5432 neighborhoods (residential committee, or juwei in Chinese) in Shanghai metropolitan, China. High SoVI occupies the city center; to its outside is a low SoVI belt, which is surrounded by medium–high SoVI in the vast suburbs and low SoVI appears in the local centers of the suburbs. This hierarchical pattern is highly significant for enhancing the understanding of urban social vulnerability. It can also facilitate urban risk management and enhance urban sustainability by identifying socially vulnerable communities and the vulnerable combination of social vulnerability and natural hazards. In this paper, an integration of the SoVI result and a flood scenario reveals vulnerable areas that should be high priorities on the agendas for mitigating flood hazards and social vulnerability.}

abstract = {User-generated content, interoperability and the social dimension are the cornerstones of an emerging paradigm for the creation and sharing of information: Web 2.0. This article studies how geoportals can benefit from the Web 2.0 features. Geoportals are World Wide Web gateways that organize content and services related to geographic information. They are the most visible part of Spatial Data Infrastructures (i.e. distributed systems that aid acquisition, processing, distribution, use, maintenance, and preservation of spatial data). Today’s geoportals are focusing on interoperability through the implementation of standards for discovery and use of geographic data and services. Will tomorrow’s Geoportals focus more on organising communities of users sharing common interests? Recent papers are arguing for deeper integration of the Web 2.0 paradigm within the geospatial web. This article aims to provide an overview supporting the next generation geoportal development by defining related concepts, by emphasising advantages and caveats of such an approach, and proposing appropriate implementation strategies.}

PPGIS/PGIS are spatially explicit methods that have evolved over the past decade to identify a range of ecosystem services. Although PPGIS/PGIS methods demonstrate high potential for the identification of ecosystem services, especially cultural services, there has been no review to evaluate the methods to identify best practice. Through examination of peer-reviewed, empirical PPGIS/PGIS studies, we describe the types of ecosystem services mapped, the spatial mapping methods, the sampling approaches and range of participants, the types of spatial analyses performed, and the methodological trade-offs associated with each PPGIS/PGIS mapping approach. We found that multiple methods were implemented in nearly 30 case studies worldwide with the mapping of cultural and provisioning services being most common. There was little evidence that mapped ecosystem data was used for actual decision support in land use planning. Best practice has yet to coalesce in this field that has been dominated by methodological pluralism and case study research. We suggest greater use of experimental design and long-term case studies where the influence of mapped ecosystem services on land use decisions can be assessed.}

The frequency of recent incidents including natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, and hurricanes, and also difficulties caused by the economic downturn has highlighted the vulnerability of human settlements and makes the appropriate consideration of resilience in the planning for future of urban areas of vital significance. Development of an assessment framework for evaluating the extent of resiliency of urban areas can be an effective way of incorporating resiliency-related issues into the urban planning process. For this purpose, it is necessary to clarify the implications of the resilience concept for the sustainability of urban areas. It is also important to identify resilience-related principles and criteria that should be embedded in the framework for assessing the resiliency of urban environments. This study involves an initial review of the literature on resilience and urban sustainability to extract a comprehensive set of criteria that can be used to develop an urban resilience assessment system. Moreover, it tries to design a conceptual framework, illustrative of the inter-relations between these various set of criteria. Criteria for assessment of the resilience of urban areas are divided into several main themes that cover environmental, economic, social, and institutional dimensions of sustainability. These themes would further be broken down into major criteria to account for important relevant areas such as land use, infrastructure, health, etc. The output of this study can be used as the basis for defining a set of precise indicators that will constitute a potential assessment tool for measuring the resilience of urban developments. The resilient assessment process has the capacity to provide decision makers with a clear and comprehensive picture of the resilience of the development proposal and supports them in making better informed decisions.}

abstract = {3D city models are valuable and useful for many experts using this information for a wide array of environmental and sustainable analyses and services. To produce 3D city models, conventional production processes are typically conducted by authoritative mapping agencies, which mostly rely on aerial photogrammetry and laser scanning. Consequently, obtaining public domain 3D city models is challenging and limited, where the majority of open data is collected and mapped by participatory mapping driven communities. These are still limited to 2D data collection proficiencies due to the used mapping infrastructures and technological limitations. Thus, the 3rd (height) dimension is mostly missing from these maps and models, resulting in the fact that public domain 3D city models are still limited, and only scarcely used for environmental applications. Perhaps one of the most important features in 3D city models are the buildings, since they serve as a major geospatial element in many environmental applications. Our objective is to use a single contributed photograph and OpenStreetMap vector data to precisely calculate the photographed building height, and add this data to the OpenStreetMap map to enable the creation of open source Level of Detail 1 (LoD1) city models. To this end, we have developed a Newton's-based method in optimization to accurately calculate building heights from single contributed photographs taken by citizens using smartphones or tablets. An Android app, OpenStreetHeight, is developed to carry out the experiments. Based on the various medium-height buildings that were photographed using the app and processed using the developed algorithms we received accurate building height values. When compared to reliable reference field measurements, the average height mean absolute error was 30cm. Combined with the OpenStreetMap footprint vector data, we were able to produce an average LoD1 volume mean absolute error of less than 5%, satisfying the CityGML standard quality. This research presents a framework for a semi-automatic crowdsourced user-generated content calculation of OpenStreetMap building heights, and the creation of reliable and accurate LoD1 building models, as a first step to enhance the already established 2D OpenStreetMap map infrastructure to the 3D domain. This enables expanding the use of OpenStreetMap as a comprehensive and detailed representation of our urban environment for various environmental and sustainable applications and analyses.}

To assess the changing patterns of EPC at the global scale, this study utilized nighttime lights in conjunction with population and built-up datasets to map EPC at 1 km resolution. Firstly, the inter-calibrated nighttime light data were enhanced using the V4.0 Gridded Population Density data and the Global Human Settlement Layer. Secondly, linear models were calibrated to relate EPC to the enhanced nighttime light data; these models were then employed to estimate per-pixel EPC in 2000 and 2013. Finally, the spatiotemporal patterns of EPC between the periods were analyzed at the country, continental, and global scales. The evaluation of the EPC estimation shows a reasonable accuracy at the provincial scale with R2 of 0.8429. Over 30% of the human settlements in Asia, Europe, and North America showed apparent EPC growth. At the national scale, moderate and high EPC growth was observed in 45% of the built-up areas in East Asia. The spatial clustering patterns revealed that EPC decreased in Russia and the Western Europe. This study provides fresh insight into the spatial pattern and variations of global electric power consumption.}

With growth in geographic information systems (GIS) in the 1990s, research began to operationalize place concepts using GIS to better inform land use decisions. After two decades, participatory mapping has emerged as an important method to identify place values. This article summarizes lessons from empirical research completed in diverse social and geographic contexts. Specifically, we find that mapped place values: (1) are best understood as relationship values, (2) reflect participant spatial/geographic discounting, (3) are closely related to place attachment and “sense of place” concepts, (4) are correlated with participant attitudes and preferences toward land use, (5) are predictive of land use conflict, (6) are associated with physical landscape features, (7) are generally stable over time, (8) are valid at multiple geographic scales, (9) exhibit greater similarity than differences across geographic areas and populations, and (10) show little evidence of actually influencing land use decisions. Despite research validity and the potential to improve social acceptability of land use decisions, place values will have limited social impact without elevating the importance of broader public participation in current socio-political systems.}

Cities located within Tornado Alley are especially at risk of being affected by tornadic activity and thus have a pressing need for a warning system. The use of strategically-placed outdoor tornado sirens is a common approach to notify residents of approaching severe weather. However, it remains difficult to ensure complete coverage (i.e. every resident within an audible distance of a siren) of such a system within a city. This study uses two distinct GIS-based methodological approaches using U.S. Census population data and siren locations to assess the extent city residents are safeguarded by the existing tornado siren network in Stillwater, Oklahoma. The first approach utilizes spatially unaltered (aggregated) census data whereas the second approach proposes a disaggregation technique incorporating building polygons to improve the spatial detail. The first approach revealed that 26% of city residents are not covered by the siren network, whereas the second approach estimated that 4–14% are not covered. The second approach provided a more precise account of Stillwater's vulnerable population due to its spatially explicit nature.}

abstract = {Abandoned houses (AH) are focal points in urban communities by threatening local security, destroying housing markets, and burdening government finance in the U.S. legacy cities. In particular, individual-level AH detection provides essential information for fine-resolution urban studies, government decision-makers, and private sector practitioners. However, three primary conventional data sources (field data, utility data, and remote sensing data) cannot suffice to collect such fine-resolution data in the large spatial area via a cost-effective approach. To this end, Google Street View (GSV) imagery, which emerges as the mainstream open-access data source with global coverage, provides an opportunity to address this issue. Subsequently, a follow-up challenge confronting the detection of AH arises from the fact that it lacks an effective method that can discern authentic visual features from the redundant noise in GSV images. In this study, we aim to develop an effective method to detect individual-level AH from GSV imagery. Specifically, we developed a new hierarchical deep learning method to leverage both global and local visual features of AH in the detection. The method can be further divided into three steps: (1) Scene-based classification that can extract global visual features of AH was implemented through fine-tuning a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model. (2) We developed a patch-based classification method that can extract specific local features of AH. In this method, patches were generated from GSV images based on auto-detected local features, followed by being labeled as three categories: building patches, vegetation patches, and others. Two deep CNN models were employed to identify deteriorated building façade patches and overgrown vegetation patches, respectively. (3) Individual-level AH were detected by integrating scene classification results and patch classification results in a decision-tree model. Experimental results showed that the F-score of AH was 0.84 in a well-prepared dataset collected from five different Rust Belt cities. The proposed hierarchical deep learning approach effectively improved the accuracy comparing with the traditional scene-based method. In addition, the proposed method was applied to generate an AH map in a new site in Detroit, MI. Our study demonstrated the feasibility of GSV imagery in AH detection and showed great potential to detect AH in a large spatial extent.}

Specifically, the client decomposes the required route into a sequence of shorter routes between intermediate locations. These routes are subsequently requested from independent online route planners with the results being integrated by the client to give the route originally required. Robustness to privacy inferences is a consequence of the fact that, without significant coordination and sharing of information, an individual online route planner cannot infer with high probability the true route source or destination. An evaluation of the proposed method is performed in the context of route planning within the street network of Boston. This evaluation demonstrates that the proposed method offers robustness to privacy inferences while exhibiting a reasonable reduction in quality of service.}

This study, based on the enhancement of the pre-developed PPGIS analytical framework, seeks to address these critiques by introducing an in-expensive effective data collection strategy, while substantially facilitating geo-spatial analytics. The U Minh Thuong National Park (UMTNP) in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam, a world’s renowned Ramsar site, was chosen to demonstrate the framework. The respondents participated in the participatory mapping on paper maps, using color markers to hand-draw (as polygons) their self-perceived areas associated with different categories ES. By collecting 2D data, the post-hoc spatial analyses could have utilized more meaningful statistical methods. In this study, we introduced the uses of three methods: Ordinary least squares (OLS), Geographically weighted regression (GWR) and Moran’s I to assess the spatial autocorrelation of ES across the landscape. In addition to participatory mapping, the respondents were also engaged in completing a semi-structured questionnaire, which was subsequently analyzed using principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis. These two multivariate analyses serve to reveal the structured diversity of the people’s perceptions towards the importance of different ES. It was shown that Provisioning ES was the most highly regarded benefit, followed by Regulating, Supporting and Cultural. Regulating and Supporting ES, the two indirect material services share relatively similar appreciation patterns while Cultural ES was unexpectedly the least credited, a stark contrast lineagainst the government designated eco-tourism and historical functions of UMTNP. Geographically, the core areas of the national park have the most overlaps between Provisioning and Regulating services. Supporting services, on the other hand, were the most associated with Provisioning and Regulating services in peripheral areas. Cultural services were synergized with the other three types of ES in the areas reserved for eco-tourism activities. The revealed spatial synergies can determine the areas where potential conflicts between extractive and non-extractive uses could occur, contributing insights for sustainable management of UMTNP and other protected areas worldwide. In addition, this study also contributes to promoting the PPGIS method in ES research and other human geographical studies, those relying on community participation.}

In this paper, we demonstrate how a recently developed inequality measure—the Kolm-Pollak equally-distributed equivalent (EDE)—could be used to support decision making to foster equity in the built environment. The EDE provides a measure of a distribution that is similar to the average (mean) but includes a penalty based on the inequality of that distribution. The primary advantage of the Kolm-Pollak EDE is that it can be used to evaluate the inequality of both desirable quantities (e.g., amenities) and undesirable quantities (e.g., burdens). This is essential in urban systems as inequities can manifest through, among other things, disparate access to opportunities like public amenities and unequal exposure to burdens, such as pollution and natural hazards. Additionally, the Kolm-Pollak EDE can be calculated for different sociodemographic subgroups, enabling needs-based assessments to promote environmental justice. Thus, the Kolm-Pollak EDE presents numerous opportunities for practitioners, policymakers, and researchers concerned with advancing equity. We demonstrate the approach with a case study of grocery store access in ten cities across the USA and provide a Python package (inequalipy) and R code to enable others to use these inequality metrics.}

Previous studies applied spatial data to evaluate environmental deprivation across various neighborhoods, and the identified deprived areas can be directly used in urban planning as areas that need to be addressed. However, perceptions of oneself regarding the local urban environment can influence sense of wellbeing, mental health, and social behavior of this individual; and any adverse feelings from the subjective environmental status can further influence perceived environmental deprivation. This perceived environmental deprivation can be different from the estimation of “objective” environmental deprivation, and perception itself can vary among subpopulations. Absence of consideration of variation in perceived environmental deprivation can lead to a failure of sustainable planning to support all oppressed people affected by urban development. Therefore, we combined citizens’ perceptions with remote-sensed and administrative data to characterize perceived environmental deprivation among subpopulations, based on a questionnaire with ranks of specific environmental issues under a “city as a whole” concept. Generally, perceived environmental deprivation among subpopulations was driven by different facts. Based on the spatial comparison, self-identified urban residents and people aged>=30 have faced higher environmental deprivation across the whole city than self-identified rural residents and younger ages. Females, lower income population, and indoor workers have faced with higher environmental deprivation across urban areas than males and higher income population and outdoor workers.

abstract = {Remote sensing image products (e.g. brightness of nighttime lights and land cover/land use types) have been widely used to disaggregate census data to produce gridded population maps for large geographic areas. The advent of the geospatial big data revolution has created additional opportunities to map population distributions at fine resolutions with high accuracy. A considerable proportion of the geospatial data contains semantic information that indicates different categories of human activities occurring at exact geographic locations. Such information is often lacking in remote sensing data. In addition, the remarkable progress in machine learning provides toolkits for demographers to model complex nonlinear correlations between population and heterogeneous geographic covariates. In this study, a typical type of geospatial big data, points-of-interest (POIs), was combined with multi-source remote sensing data in a random forests model to disaggregate the 2010 county-level census population data to 100 × 100 m grids. Compared with the WorldPop population dataset, our population map showed higher accuracy. The root mean square error for population estimates in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chongqing for this method and WorldPop were 27,829 and 34,193, respectively. The large under-allocation of the population in urban areas and over-allocation in rural areas in the WorldPop dataset was greatly reduced in this new population map. Apart from revealing the effectiveness of POIs in improving population mapping, this study promises the potential of geospatial big data for mapping other socioeconomic parameters in the future.}

Presumably, the willingness-to-pay for landscape amenities should be very different between homeowners and tenants. Thus far, how landscape amenities affect residential rental prices is not well understood. This paper takes advantage of the big data of online housing advertisements to unravel how landscape amenities are capitalized into rental prices across five Chinese megacities (Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Hangzhou and Wuhan). Natural language processing, the latent Dirichlet allocation in particular, is first employed to semantically analyze the geo-textual advertisements. It reveals that ‘landscape amenities’ is a typical topic and ‘park’ is a typical component for housing advertisements in the five megacities. The lexicon-based sentimental analysis further shows that the strength of the sentiments associated with the ‘landscape amenities’ varies with cities. A series of hierarchical hedonic models based on the extracted semantic and sentimental aspects are then established for each megacity after segmenting the rental market into submarkets. The capitalization effect of landscape amenities is significant in Beijing, Hangzhou and Wuhan, while it is not significant in Shanghai and Shenzhen. Finally, variance decomposition analysis and marginal implicit price calculation unveil to what extent landscape amenities contribute to residential rental prices. Based on these findings, we discuss several major implications for urban planning. Our study unsettles the popular presumption that landscape amenities are key determinants of real estate values. It renews our understanding of the economic values of landscape amenities theoretically and methodologically.}

This paper investigates Twitter activity in the wake of Hurricane Sandy in order to demonstrate the complex relationship between the material world and its digital representations. Through documenting the various spatial patterns of Sandy-related tweeting both within the New York metropolitan region and across the United States, we make a series of broader conceptual and methodological interventions into the nascent geographic literature on big data. Rather than focus on how these massive databases are causing necessary and irreversible shifts in the ways that knowledge is produced, we instead find it more productive to ask how small subsets of big data, especially georeferenced social media information scraped from the internet, can reveal the geographies of a range of social processes and practices. Utilizing both qualitative and quantitative methods, we can uncover broad spatial patterns within this data, as well as understand how this data reflects the lived experiences of the people creating it. We also seek to fill a conceptual lacuna in studies of user-generated geographic information, which have often avoided any explicit theorizing of sociospatial relations, by employing Jessop et al.’s TPSN framework. Through these interventions, we demonstrate that any analysis of user-generated geographic information must take into account the existence of more complex spatialities than the relatively simple spatial ontology implied by latitude and longitude coordinates.}

Over two decades have transpired since the term was introduced and this chapter revisits the emergence of both theory and practice over that time. The chapter begins with a reintroduction of some of the key elements of Cybercartography in two previous volumes (Taylor, 2005; Taylor and Lauriault, 2014) and goes on to discuss new theoretical and applied dimensions leading to a re-definition of the concept. The central elements as outlined in the earlier volumes are still relevant today but have been modified, expanded and refined as a result of the ongoing research, especially that resulting from the application of Cybercartography in an international/Indigenous context and the application of Cartography to language mapping, both of which have led to new theoretical insights. The initial definition of Cybercartography was strongly influenced by practice rather than theory. The central importance of the main product of Cybercartography, the cybercartographic atlas, remains, but recent thinking and experience sees the importance of the process by which such atlases are produced as equally, if not more important, than the product. Over time, storytelling has become increasingly important to Cybercartography. Both mapping and storytelling are basic human instincts and are a central part of the holistic nature of Cybercartography.}

What can be considered a geographic information system has expanded to include web-based technologies like Google Earth/Maps, as well as more recent developments of Microsoft’s Bing Maps and the mobile version of ArcGIS available for the iPhone. In addition to these developments, a discursive shift toward ‘location’ is occurring across the Internet industry. Location has become the new buzzword for social-spatial strategies to target consumers. As reported in 2010, venture capitalists have, since 2009, invested $115million into ‘location start-ups’ – software companies that provide location-based services to mobile computing consumers (Miller and Wortham, 2010). Applications like Foursquare, Loopt, Gowalla, and most recently, Facebook Places allow users to ‘check-in’ at restaurants, bars, gyms, retail outlets, and offices, thereby sharing their location within their social network. These developments enable consumers to (re)discover their proximities to products, while feeding a desire for making known one’s everyday movements. Here, I discuss the development of location-based services as the proliferation of a peculiar form of geographic information: conspicuous mobility. Through discussion of a recent gathering of location-aware software professionals and through analysis of discourses that emerge over a battle between ‘check in’ companies, I sketch an area of study that explores the implications of these emerging geographic information ‘systems’, and new everyday cartographers.}

We used data sets including house structural attributes, house photos, locational amenities, street view images, transportation accessibility, visitor patterns, and socioeconomic attributes of neighborhoods to enrich our understanding of the real estate appreciation and its predictive modeling. As a case study, we investigate more than 20,000 houses in the Greater Boston Area, and discuss the spatial dependency of house price appreciations, influential variables and their relationships. In detail, we extract deep features from street view images and house photos using a deep learning model, merging features from multi-source data and modeling house price appreciation using machine learning models and the geographically weighted regression at two spatial scales: fine-scale point level and aggregated neighborhood level. Results show that the house price appreciation rate can be modeled with high accuracy using the proposed framework (R2=0.74 for gradient boosting machine at neighborhood-scale). We discovered that houses with low house prices and small house areas may have a higher house appreciation potential. Our results provide insights into how multi-source big geo-data can be employed in machine learning frameworks to characterize real estate price trends and help understand human settlements for policy-making.}

Although population distribution has been considered highly correlated with urban facilities, the quantitative relationship between the two has yet to be revealed when considering huge heterogeneity. To address this problem, the present study proposed a novel population mapping method by adopting Luojia 1-01 nighttime light imagery, points of interest (POI), and social media check-in data. A grid-based attraction degree (AD) model was built to quantify the possibility of population concentration in each geographic unit with a comprehensive consideration of the distribution and the popularity of facilities. On the basis of kernel density estimation, 16 attraction indexes were extracted by matching POI and check-in data. Multiple variables were used to train a random forest model, through which fine-scale population mapping was conducted in Zhejiang, China. The comparison between demographic and WorldPop data proved the high accuracy of our approach (R2 = 0.75 and 0.58). To explore the characteristics of the model further, the most appropriate search distance (650 m) and acquisition time (19:00–08:00) of the check-in data were discussed. The contrast experiment revealed that the model could outperform those from previous studies on rural and suburban areas with a few check-in points and low AD; thus, the mapping error caused by heterogeneity considerably decreased. The results indicated the proposed method has great potential in fine-scale population mapping.}

abstract = {Despite the rapidly increasing population of the world, the amount of agricultural land remains the same. For this reason, agricultural fields are gradually becoming ‘collective scarce resources’. Many countries have put restrictions on property ownership in order to manage these resources. In addition, most countries are trying to implement agricultural policies by developing various systems pertaining to these areas. The existing cadastral system in Turkey is inadequately equipped to identify the location, amount and quality of agricultural land. Therefore, due to the nature of agricultural land, the restrictions on immovable property cannot be expediently applied. This study aimed to implement registration of agricultural lands under a Land Administration System (LAS). Thus, public restrictions applied to agricultural areas could be represented under the LAS. In this way, implementation of agricultural policies would be utilised even more effectively than under current land management systems. In order to realise this aim, a village in north-eastern Turkey where cadastral work had not been completed was chosen for the study. Firstly, the agricultural classifications of the subparcels in the village were determined. These were then combined into cadastral parcels. Four important findings emerging from the study showed that: 1) agricultural classification and cadastral work could be carried out together, 2) agricultural areas could be registered in the LAS, 3) public restrictions arising from agricultural land usage could be determined, and 4) the ‘land type’ section in the land registry was insufficient in reflecting the features of the immovable property, thus making a more precise class identity necessary. In addition to ‘land type’, the term ‘land class’ was proposed for the land registry. Although the study was conducted for an unplanned rural area, it is recommended that researchers carry out future studies in terms of more precise identity requirements for urban areas.}

Significant reduction of urban energy consumption and CO2 emissions is essential for meeting the ambitious climate stabilization targets. This hinges on having adequate understanding of the patterns and trends of emissions. It is essential to create datasets of cities emissions and utilize mapping techniques to inform planners and decision makers about the dynamics of urban carbon emissions. Due to the openness of cities and issues related to availability and accessibility of urban energy consumption data, this is a challenging task. It is critical to develop consistent methods for mapping emissions. Such methods and frameworks should enable cities to map their emissions with minimum data requirements. They should also be applicable to different cities across the world. As a preliminary effort, this study introduces a framework for synthesizing building and transport energy consumption data with the Local Climate Zones (LCZs) classification system. Drawing on preliminary results from applying the framework to Bangkok, Shanghai, and Tokyo, we explain how this approach can provide opportunities for standardizing urban carbon accounting. The paper concludes with suggestions for improving granularity and accuracy of emissions accounting. The concept of Local Energy Zones (LEZs) is introduced and is suggested to be used as a potentially suitable concept for analysing CO2 emissions dynamics of cities.}

abstract = {The prosperity of ride-sharing services has rippled in the communities of GIScience, transportation, and urban planning. Meanwhile, road network structure has been analyzed from a network science perspective that focuses on nodes and relational links and aims to predictive models. However, limited empirical studies have explored the relationship between road network structure and ride-sharing accessibility through such perspective. This paper utilizes the spatial Durbin model to understand the relationship between road network structure and ride-sharing accessibility, proxied by Uber accessibility, through classical network measures of degree, closeness, and betweenness centrality. Taking the city of Atlanta as a case study, we have found in addition to population density and road network density, larger values of degree centrality and smaller values of closeness centrality of the road network are associated with better accessibility of Uber services. However, the effects of betweenness centrality are not significant. Furthermore, we have revealed heterogeneous effects of degree centrality and closeness centrality on the accessibility of Uber services, as the magnitudes of their effects vary by different time windows (i.e., weekday vs. weekend, rush hour in the morning vs. evening). Network science provides us both conceptual and methodological measures to understand the association between road network structure and ride-sharing accessibility. In this study, we constructed road network structure measures with OpenStreetMap, which is reproducible, replicable, and scalable because of its global coverage and public availability. The study resonates with the notion of cities as the set of interactions across networks, as we have observed time-sensitive heterogeneous effects of road network structure on ride-sharing accessibility.}

While there is consensus about its necessity, politicians, administrations, and citizens have to deal with the effects of infrastructure construction on a local level. The success of participation depends on several factors, to some of which digital tools (e.g., online communication or Virtual Reality visualization) can contribute. Decisions can be improved by reducing the complexity of technical knowledge, simplifying data processing, picturing results in an intuitive way, and making participation more attractive. This chapter focuses on the potential of visualization tools. It describes and evaluates two case studies from the perspective of the executing organization on the one hand and the involved citizens on the other hand: the Forbach Pumped-storage Power Plant and the Traffic development in Herrenberg. However, digital instruments cannot obviate the need for a tailor-made concept and personal contact through which participatory culture can develop in the first place.}

New methods for citizens collaborating with city governments are also emerging to enhance citizen engagement and to spur social innovation. By synthesizing recent advancements in geo-enabled citizen participation, this paper proposed a new typology for classifying and characterizing concepts and practices related to geospatial technology-mediated public participation in local governments (e.g. city and municipal governments). Practical examples are used to illustrate how new dynamics between local governments and citizens are formed, new methods of collecting local spatial knowledge are enabled, and new opportunities for improving the openness and operational efficiency of local governments have emerged.

Supporting and regulatory ecosystem services in coastal areas have received considerable research attention given human vulnerability to climate change, but cultural ecosystem services in the coastal zone are less understood. This study describes and analyzes the distribution of cultural ecosystem values found in coastal areas in multiple countries (n = 5) and compares the results with non-coastal areas. Mapped cultural ecosystem values were collected from public participation GIS (PPGIS) processes in the U.S., Australia, New Zealand, Norway, and Malaysia and analyzed to identify the type and intensity of ecosystem values located in coastal areas. Mapped ecosystem values were significantly more abundant in all coastal zones, regardless of ecosystem value category, country, population, or dominant land use. Compared to cultural ecosystem values, biological and life-sustaining values were mapped less frequently in the coastal zone. Economic and social values were significantly associated with developed (built) coastal zones, while aesthetic and recreation values were more strongly associated with natural coastal zones. Coastal access, especially by road, influences the mix of perceived values from nature-based values to anthropocentric values. Coastal zones will continue to be the principle location for potential future land use conflict given their high social and cultural value relative to other ecological values. Understanding trade-offs in coastal zone planning and management requires a systematic inventory of the full range of ecosystem services, including cultural services.}

Empowering these communities requires developing representations that enable collaborative reflection, promote mutual visibility of volunteers’ efforts and sustain a shared view of the community. Similarly, it is necessary to envision visualizations that facilitate sense making of large, simultaneous and distributed pieces of heterogeneous information with different levels of credibility and priority. Accordingly, this paper identifies and characterizes these challenges to propose a multi-view and multi-abstraction-level visualization approach for emergency communities of volunteers. In particular, it combines time-oriented visualizations, space-filling visualization techniques, interaction mechanisms and coordinated maps to support community participation as well as collaborative and individual sense making.

Stakeholders representing multiple interests are presumed to hold different management preferences for these lands. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate how stakeholder perspectives can influence place-based management preferences for public lands. We developed a multi-dimensional public land preference scale and used cluster analysis of responses to classify individuals (n=1507) into stakeholder groups using data collected from a large public participation GIS (PPGIS) survey in Victoria, Australia. We analyzed the results of the two largest stakeholder groups (identified as “Preservation” and “Recreation”) to assess their spatial preferences for public land conservation, access, and development. We developed a method to assess the level of spatial stakeholder agreement, with the results identifying geographic areas of both agreement and disagreement between stakeholder groups. To determine the effects of unequal stakeholder participation in mapping, we performed sensitivity analysis by weighting the responses of the Recreation stakeholder group to approximate the mapping effort of the Preservation stakeholder group. The place-based management preferences changed significantly for conservation/development and improving/limiting public land access, while preferences for increasing/limiting facility development were less sensitive to stakeholder weighting. The spatial mapping of stakeholder preferences appears effective for identifying locations with high potential for conflict as well as areas of agreement, but would benefit from further research in a range of land management applications to provide further guidance on the analysis of stakeholder group responses that result from diverse stakeholder group participation.}

The Data Poverty Index (DPI) provides an open-source means of annually evaluating global access to data and information. The DPI can be used to monitor aspects of data and information availability at global and national levels, with potential application at local (district) levels. Access to data and information is a major factor in disaster risk reduction, increased resilience to disaster and improved adaptation to climate change. In that context, the DPI could be a useful tool for monitoring the Sustainable Development Goals of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015–2030). The effects of severe data poverty, particularly limited access to geoinformatic data, free software and online training materials, are discussed in the context of sustainable development and disaster risk reduction. Unlike many other indices, the DPI is underpinned by datasets that are consistently provided annually for almost all the countries of the world and can be downloaded without restriction or cost.}

Defining the public interest for marine and coastal areas remains a wicked problem, however, resistant to resolution. A focus on more tangible ‘public values’ offers an alternative for policy and planning in specific contexts. However, ambiguity surrounds who or what constitutes the ‘public’, with stakeholder engagement often used as a proxy in marine and coastal research. In this study, the outcomes of participatory processes involving the public from diverse backgrounds and geographical locales were explored. A public participation GIS (PPGIS) survey was undertaken in the remote Kimberley region of Australia to identify the spatial values and management preferences for marine and coastal areas. Similarities and differences between the volunteer public (n = 372) and online panel respondents (n = 206); and for the volunteer public only, differences between residents (n = 118) and non-residents (n = 254) were assessed. Online panelists evidenced lesser quality mapping data and did not provide a reliable means of accessing ‘public’ values. Residents were more likely to map general recreational and recreational fishing values while non-locals were more likely to map biological/conservation and wilderness values. Overall, residents and non-residents were more alike than dissimilar in their mapping of values and management preferences, suggesting that the need to preference local views may be overstated, although there may be differences in policy priorities. Future research should focus on the breadth and representativeness of stakeholder interests to access the views of wider society and hence public values, rather than current approaches where local interests are often the primary focus of participatory stakeholder engagement.}

Currently, 54% of the world's population lives in cities, and an increase of 66% is expected by 2050. Based on the World Urbanisation Prospects' report, most of this growth is projected to concentrate in Asia and Africa. The resulting uncontrolled urbanisation can lead to many issues with profound impacts on health, poverty, and social inequality. Monitoring our global landscapes in the most rapidly growing regions particularly in the global south becomes thus an important endeavour. The estimation of future urban patterns become thus part of important topics that foresight the necessary support systems that efficiently cope with the carrying capacity of these urban regions. In this sense, this paper aims to i) monitor historical land cover changes in one of such major cities - Maputo, Mozambique, and, ii) project future patterns of urban fabric in its metropolitan region. To achieve this, satellite imagery from Landsat between 2000 and 2015 was collected and classified using a maximum likelihood algorithm. Spatiotemporal monitoring of urban settlements showed that within the proposed temporal scope, massive urban development took place while depleting a substantial amount of other land use types. Based on this spatiotemporal cognisance, a customized cellular automaton (CA) model was built that embeds the trends of changes while predicting future patterns. Our predictions exposed a significant amount of urbanisation will evolve over the next years if no significant controlling mechanism to cope with rapid urbanisation is integrated. Our findings, as well as conclusions, aim to aid local urban planners and policy makers in the course of urban planning in the region while taking advantage of novel open source methodologies that offer cost reduction and enable efficient monitoring for large urban extents.}

abstract = {Summary
Background
Surgical, anaesthetic, and obstetric (SAO) health-care system strengthening is needed to address the emergency and essential surgical care that approximately 5 billion individuals lack globally. To our knowledge, a complete, non-modelled national situational analysis based on the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery surgical indicators has not been done. We aimed to undertake a complete situation analysis of SAO system preparedness, service delivery, and financial risk protection using the core surgical indicators proposed by the Commission in Colombia, an upper-middle-income country.
Methods
Data to inform the six core surgical system indicators were abstracted from the Colombian national health information system and the most recent national health survey done in 2007. Geographical access to a Bellwether hospital (defined as a hospital capable of providing essential and emergency surgery) within 2 h was assessed by determining 2 h drive time boundaries around Bellwether facilities and the population within and outside these boundaries. Physical 2 h access to a Bellwether was determined by the presence of a motor vehicle suitable for individual transportation. The Department Administrativo Nacional de Estadística population projection for 2016 and 2018 was used to calculate the SAO provider density. Total operative volume was calculated for 2016 and expressed nationally per 100 000 population. The total number of postoperative deaths that occurred within 30 days of a procedure was divided by the total operative volume to calculate the all-cause, non-risk-adjusted postoperative mortality. The proportion of the population subject to impoverishing costs was calculated by subtracting the baseline number of impoverished individuals from those who fell below the poverty line once out-of-pocket payments were accounted for. Individuals who incurred out-of-pocket payments that were more than 10% of their annual household income were considered to have experienced catastrophic expenditure. Using GIS mapping, SAO system preparedness, service delivery, and cost protection were also contextualised by socioeconomic status.
Findings
In 2016, at least 7·1 million people (15·1% of the population) in Colombia did not have geographical access to SAO services within a 2 h driving distance. SAO provider density falls short of the Commission's minimum target of 20 providers per 100 000 population, at an estimated density of 13·7 essential SAO health-care providers per 100 000 population in 2018. Lower socioeconomic status of a municipality, as indicated by proportion of people enrolled in the subsidised insurance regime, was associated with a smaller proportion of the population in the municipality being within 2 h of a Bellwether facility, and the most socioeconomically disadvantaged municipalities often had no SAO providers. Furthermore, Colombian providers appear to be working at or beyond capacity, doing 2690–3090 procedures per 100 000 population annually, but they have maintained a relatively low median postoperative mortality of 0·74% (IQR 0·48–0·84). Finally, out-of-pocket expenses for indirect health-care costs were a key barrier to accessing surgical care, prompting 3·1 million (6·4% of the population) individuals to become impoverished and 9·5 million (19·4% of the population) individuals to incur catastrophic expenditures in 2007.
Interpretation
We did a non-modelled, indicator-based situation analysis of the Colombian SAO system, finding that it has not yet met, but is working towards achieving, the targets set by the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery. The observed interdependence of these indicators and correlation with socioeconomic status are consistent with well recognised factors and outcomes of social, health, and health-care inequity. The internal consistency observed in Colombia's situation analysis validates the use of the indicators and has now informed development of an early national SAO plan in Colombia, to set a data-informed stage for implementation and evaluation of timely, safe, and affordable SAO health care, within the National Public Health Decennial Plan, which is due in 2022.

Such analytical capacity at the knowledge system level facilitates transparency and credibility needed for nation-states to cooperate on issues requiring global coordination, including “super-wicked” environmental issues like climate change. So far there has been relatively sparse attention paid to whether countries will have the ability – or policy analytical capacity – to report the necessary data and indicators required for the next round of global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) being proposed. In this paper, I argue that the varied policy analytical capacity within the global environmental knowledge system necessitates the participation of new institutions and actors. Identifying gaps in data availability at a global, systemic scale, this paper presents a proxy measure of policy analytical capacity based on publicly-reported national statistics of air and water quality performance. Such discrepancies evaluated at a systemic level make a case for channels by which citizen scientists, independent watchdogs, private sector companies and third-party organizations can participate to enhance the policy analytical capacity of governments.}

In recent years the usage of social media has gained momentum to study the aesthetic preferences and perception of the environment. However, until now the different approaches have not yet been sufficiently combined to provide more in depth understanding of what attracts people in the landscape We propose a robust methodology using social media photos from Flickr and Panoramio to estimate the correlation between landscape attributes and landscape preferences. We combine formal modeling of spatial photo distribution based on the occurrence of landscape elements with content analysis of the photos to pinpoint what it is in a landscape that attracts people. We use the Kromme Rijn Area –a peri-urban area in the center of the Netherlands and a popular recreation area- as case study area. The analysis shows that this area is appreciated by its visitors and residents for the presence of monumental buildings, small water bodies and opportunities for hikes along grasslands. The method successfully linked the structural elements of the landscape with the revealed preferences, providing a way of quantifying the appreciation of the landscape. Qualitative surveys remain essential to study motivations for outdoor recreation, but social media data can be incorporated as evidence of what elements of the landscape are valued, where people are interacting with the landscape, and how these interactions characterize a landscape.}

The method is demonstrated by producing a continuous daily time step snow probability map dataset for the Czech Republic region. For validation, we checked the ability of our method to reconstruct MODIS snow cover under cloud by simulating cloud cover datasets and comparing estimated snow cover to actual MODIS snow cover.

The output data sets are published on the HydroShare website for download and through a web map service for re-use in third-party applications.}

We also examine summary statistics describing each network topology and show these to be a consequence of the same processes. This represents the discovery of a novel link between different aspects of the growth.}

Such an approach overlooks several important inter-relationships among the largely different integrated components of cultural ES, i.e. recreational, spiritual, education concerns, etc. In this paper, the need of more explicit typologies is underscored via a case study, where the authors represented the discrepancies between two tiers of Cultural ES: those associated with Spiritual Values and Recreational Opportunities using a socio-georaphically-based tri-indicator analytical framework. More specifically, two survey-based (Richness and Quality of ES), and one GIS-based (Willingness to Travel (WTT)) indices were proposed to evaluate a full range of cultural benefits derived from seven popular tourism sites of Ha Tien Town, Kien Giang, Vietnam. These numerical indicators pointed out the significant differences between ritual values and recreational based benefits, underlining the crucial need of fuller taxonomies of cultural services within the ES analytical framework. With respect to the study area, the measurements of Quality and Richness detected major synergies and tradeoffs among the evaluated benefits, supporting the need to balance management between developing tourism activities and preserving cultural identity of the landscapes. The last indicator, WTT utilizes map data from OpenStreetMap to produce an objective metric in evaluating landscape quality, taking into account the frequency and the potential costs in traveling to respective sites. This indicator constitutes a reliable and equitable method to represent relevant Cultural ES of landscapes besides the popular yet controversial money-based indices, e.g. Willingness to Pay or Willingness to Accept.}

The heterogeneous geography of broadband infrastructure and investments results in variable service provision, and as such, there exist large disparities in access and performance within different spatio-temporal locations. This paper presents analysis of 4.7 million crowdsourced Internet speed test results that were compiled between 2010 and 2013 alongside various indicators of socio-spatial structure to map disparities in English broadband speed between and within urban areas. Although average speeds have improved over time, inequity is shown to emerge between different societal groups and locations. Short-term dynamics also reveal that in areas of different density, speeds can fall dramatically during peak hours, thus influencing the availability of services. The apparent disparities in access and performance represent a major issue as Internet use becomes increasingly ubiquitous in our everyday lives, with inequalities evoking social and economic disadvantage at local and national scales. This work resonates with UK government policy that has stimulated considerable investment in improving infrastructure, and presents analysis of an expansive crowd sourced “big data” resource for the first time.}

Just as this applied to people living in the past, so it applies to those of us concerned with trying to understand those past lives through the archaeological record. Most, if not all, archaeological material has a spatial component and it is not surprising, therefore, that spatial thinking has been central within archaeological endeavour since the beginnings of the discipline. Specific forms of spatial thinking have changed with developing theory and methods and with changing analytical and technological opportunities resulting in the rich variety of approaches available to us today. Within this development, the rapid adoption of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology since the early 1990s has had a major impact on archaeology and related disciplines and its use is now almost taken for granted. Although the use of GIS in archaeology has always been, and still is contentious at the theoretical level, the attractions of the technology are usually seen to outweigh any restrictions or disadvantages. In this paper we situate the use of GIS, including the papers in this volume, within the wider arena of spatial thinking in archaeology in an attempt to assess the impact that this technology has had on how we think spatially.}

In addition, there has also been progression from small pilot studies to large data collection Earth Science citizen science initiatives that are used to underpin modelling. However, despite this, numerous operational and strategic challenges exist and whilst the awareness of citizen science has improved markedly, it is clear that the direct impact of citizen science on policy and decision making is still limited. Within this paper, we review these challenges alongside defining citizen science itself, and its benefits. The range of methods and applications of citizen science are explored through a series of case studies centred on geohazards, observations & classification, multi-topic, and education/outreach.

Earlier studies assessed air pollution exposure according to travel time and city-level air pollution. The lack of spatially fine-grained travel data is a barrier to an accurate assessment of air pollution exposure. Due to a high-level spatial granularity, Strava Metro provides an opportunity to assessing air pollution exposure in combination with spatially varying air pollution concentrations. Strava Metro anonymized and aggregated a large volume of users’ traces to streets for each city. In this study, to explore the potential of crowdsourced geographic information in research of active travel and health, we used Strava Metro data and GIS technologies to assess air pollution exposure in Glasgow, UK. Particularly, we incorporated time of the trip to assess average inhaled dose of pollutant during a single cycling or pedestrian trip. Empirical results demonstrate that Strava Metro data provides an opportunity to an assessment of average air pollution exposure during active travel. Additionally, to demonstrate the potential of Strava Metro data in policy-making, we explored the spatial association of air pollution concentration and active travel. As a result, we identified areas that require investment priority, and finally offered implications for policies.}

Our work addresses these threats, particularly within the European Union (EU), where a related legal framework has been established. We follow an open and participatory approach that allows more people to share their experiences of invasive alien species (IAS) in their surroundings. Over the past three years, we developed a mobile phone application, together with the underlying data management and validation infrastructure, which allows smartphone users to report a selected list of IAS. We put quality assurance and data integration mechanisms into place that allows the uptake of information into existing official systems in order to make it accessible to the relevant policy-making at EU level. This article summarises our scientific methodology and technical approach, explains our decisions, and provides an outlook to the future of IAS monitoring involving citizens and utilising the latest technological advancements. Last but not least we emphasise on software design for reuse, within the domain of IAS monitoring, but also for supporting citizen science apps more generally. Whereas much could already be achieved, many scientific, technical and organizational challenges still remain to be addressed before data can be seamlessly shared and integrated. Here, we particularly highlight issues that emerge in an international setting, which involves many different stakeholders.}

We use the Weka and ARIES software to produce two examples of DDM: firewood use in South Africa and biodiversity value in Sicily, respectively. Our South African example demonstrates that DDM (64–91% accuracy) can identify the areas where firewood use is within the top quartile with comparable accuracy as conventional modelling techniques (54–77% accuracy). The Sicilian example highlights how DDM can be made more accessible to decision makers, who show both capacity and willingness to engage with uncertainty information. Uncertainty estimates, produced as part of the DDM process, allow decision makers to determine what level of uncertainty is acceptable to them and to use their own expertise for potentially contentious decisions. We conclude that DDM has a clear role to play when modelling ecosystem services, helping produce interdisciplinary models and holistic solutions to complex socio-ecological issues.}

With GPS technology and wireless communication technology maturing and their cost decreasing, floating car technology has been used in traffic monitoring and management, and the dynamic positioning data from floating cars become a new data source for updating road maps. In this paper, we aim to update digital road maps using the floating car data from China's National Commercial Vehicle Monitoring Platform, and present an incremental road network extraction method suitable for the platform's GPS data whose sampling frequency is low and which cover a large area. Based on both spatial and semantic relationships between a trajectory point and its associated road segment, the method classifies each trajectory point, and then merges every trajectory point into the candidate road network through the adding or modifying process according to its type. The road network is gradually updated until all trajectories have been processed. Finally, this method is applied in the updating process of major roads in North China and the experimental results reveal that it can accurately derive geometric information of roads under various scenes. This paper provides a highly-efficient, low-cost approach to update digital road maps.}

The 2016 Wuhan flood in the center of China utilized observations of non-scientists' from Internet media to capture the spatial distribution of urban flooding. Various sources in online news, blogs, bbs, and governmental websites were included. Independent flood-related factors such as rainfall, wetlands degradation, elevation, land use and land cover, curvature, slope, and normalized difference vegetation index were integrated into a logistic regression model to produce a susceptibility map. The feasibility and accuracy of this model was evaluated via comparison with official inundation maps and shortcomings of previous drainage system design. The accuracy assessment by receiver operating characteristics curve analysis estimated a success rate of 95.4%. This result shows that the data from mainstream media and public observations provide accurate and comparable information on flood occurrence at the urban scale. The assessment can be used to plan and design preventative drainage strategies for decision-makers. Finally, the limitations of Internet media as a new data resource for flooding risk assessment and future directions are discussed.}

The activities associated with the enormously intensified global connectivity have resulted in large amounts of data being generated, which in turn provides opportunities for generating knowledge that will allow more effective management of animal and human health risks. This so-called Big Data has, more recently, been accompanied by the Internet of Things which highlights the increasing presence of a wide range of sensors, interconnected via the Internet. Analysis of this data needs to exploit its complexity, accommodate variation in data quality and should take advantage of its spatial and temporal dimensions, where available. Apart from the development of hardware technologies and networking/communication infrastructure, it is necessary to develop appropriate data management tools that make this data accessible for analysis. This includes relational databases, geographical information systems and most recently, cloud-based data storage such as Hadoop distributed file systems. While the development in analytical methodologies has not quite caught up with the data deluge, important advances have been made in a number of areas, including spatial and temporal data analysis where the spectrum of analytical methods ranges from visualisation and exploratory analysis, to modelling. While there used to be a primary focus on statistical science in terms of methodological development for data analysis, the newly emerged discipline of data science is a reflection of the challenges presented by the need to integrate diverse data sources and exploit them using novel data- and knowledge-driven modelling methods while simultaneously recognising the value of quantitative as well as qualitative analytical approaches. Machine learning regression methods, which are more robust and can handle large datasets faster than classical regression approaches, are now also used to analyse spatial and spatio-temporal data. Multi-criteria decision analysis methods have gained greater acceptance, due in part, to the need to increasingly combine data from diverse sources including published scientific information and expert opinion in an attempt to fill important knowledge gaps. The opportunities for more effective prevention, detection and control of animal health threats arising from these developments are immense, but not without risks given the different types, and much higher frequency, of biases associated with these data.}

A framework for adaptive co-management and design is introduced as a basis for the operationalisation of urban resilience, highlighting the need to actively solve problems collaboratively by exercising imagination and creativity, and presenting a new and potentially fertile source for innovation. Five experiments exploring urban planning practices relating to the framework are put forward as examples of urban resilience in practice: an online crowd-sourcing application for mapping underused spaces; an interactive timeline tool for identifying drivers of change over time; a guidance and signposting tool to help community projects overcome resource barriers; an epistemic network of citizens that exchanges knowledge and resources relating to underused spaces; and an online portal that provides visibility for community groups or projects, and facilitates horizontal networking. The paper describes each experiment, sets out the aims and theoretical contexts, records any initial findings, and reflects on the potential and limitations. Initial findings are discussed relating to the challenges of crowd-sourcing spatial or historical data, and the resource commitment required for the emerging practices. It is observed that the experiments attempt to address fundamental issues in urban planning practice and policy, and involve established and familiar activities. The paper concludes that the research provides insight into what urban resilience might mean in practice and that each experiment has the potential to make a tangible contribution to the transition to urban resilience and sustainability.}

abstract = {Floods are one of the most devastating types of worldwide disasters in terms of human, economic, and social losses. If authoritative data is scarce, or unavailable for some periods, other sources of information are required to improve streamflow estimation and early flood warnings. Georeferenced social media messages are increasingly being regarded as an alternative source of information for coping with flood risks. However, existing studies have mostly concentrated on the links between geo-social media activity and flooded areas. Thus, there is still a gap in research with regard to the use of social media as a proxy for rainfall-runoff estimations and flood forecasting. To address this, we propose using a transformation function that creates a proxy variable for rainfall by analysing geo-social media messages and rainfall measurements from authoritative sources, which are later incorporated within a hydrological model for streamflow estimation. We found that the combined use of official rainfall values with the social media proxy variable as input for the Probability Distributed Model (PDM), improved streamflow simulations for flood monitoring. The combination of authoritative sources and transformed geo-social media data during flood events achieved a 71% degree of accuracy and a 29% underestimation rate in a comparison made with real streamflow measurements. This is a significant improvement on the respective values of 39% and 58%, achieved when only authoritative data were used for the modelling. This result is clear evidence of the potential use of derived geo-social media data as a proxy for environmental variables for improving flood early-warning systems.}

Using the threatened koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) as a case study, we demonstrate a novel, socio-ecological approach for identifying conservation opportunity that spatially connects landscapes with community preferences to prioritize koala recovery strategies at a regional scale. We conceptualize conservation opportunity as the spatial integration of three sustainability criteria—ecological potential, social acceptability, and economic feasibility. The social acceptability criterion was assessed using a crowdsourced spatial survey that identified spatial preferences for koalas and land uses that impact koala conservation. As a novel approach, we addressed important research questions regarding the design, collection, and analysis of crowdsourced mapping data for identifying socially acceptable conservation opportunities. Public preferences for koalas were mapped closer to home, in higher suitable koala habitats than expected, were more pronounced in conservation and natural areas on public lands, and were mapped less frequently in modified agricultural landscapes. When the multiple criteria (ecological, social, and economic) were included in the conservation assessment, we found the social acceptability criterion exerted the greatest influence on spatial conservation priorities. The systematic assessment of social criteria for conservation using spatial surveys provides information that can be integrated with ecological information to prioritize conservation opportunities. Potential enhancements include expanding survey recruitment efforts and using alternative social data collection methods to achieve greater geographic and socio-demographic representation, and augmenting the economic feasibility assessment with private property values and transaction data from voluntary conservation agreements with private landowners.}

This paper addresses this challenge by studying how information propagates and evolves over time at the intersection of the physical and cyber spaces. By analyzing the spatial footprint, social network structure, and content in both physical and cyber spaces we advance our understanding of the information propagation mechanisms in social media. The utility of this approach is demonstrated in two real-world case studies, the first reflecting a planned event (the Occupy Wall Street – OWS – movement’s Day of Action in November 2011), and the second reflecting an unexpected disaster (the Boston Marathon bombing in April 2013). Our findings highlight the intricate nature of the propagation and evolution of information both within and across cyber and physical spaces, as well as the role of hybrid networks in the exchange of information between these spaces.}

In recent years, research has shown a growing interest in information from geolocated digital footprints created by users of social networks, particularly on the Twitter microblogging platform. This form of social media allows users to create and exchange information in short messages, sometimes accompanied by photographs, videos, or other media. For the researcher, Twitter offers two advantages: the principle of communication is based on the diffusion of short and concise messages; in addition, the company Twitter is freely made available to any Internet user, by opening an account on the platform and a few lines of code, some of the content broadcast daily, via different APIs2. A decade of scientific work has developed a wide spectrum of fields of interest and disciplines involved: the first publications relating to the use of Twitter appeared the year after the platform was launched and focused on the observation of the microblog as a social phenomenon: it was then a question of understanding the construction of user networks, and the reasons that engage them in a process of using and adopting these tools in their daily lives.}

abstract = {Introduction
The existing healthcare-services-related literature tends to examine accessibility under a single travel mode, and measurement approaches are remaining limited for several inherent deficiency. This paper proposed a methodological enhancement of the three-step floating catchment area approach.
Methods
First, we incorporates real-time travel time and trip distance of private car and public transport obtained from open-source route planning API into model, which aims to differentiate the impact of multiple travel costs on spatial accessibility outcomes; next, an arithmetic mean-based Gaussian weight algorithm was introduced for achieve stable accessibility index; then, exploratory factor analysis was further employed to evaluate healthcare capacity, with the total score as the healthcare supply indicator to calculate the provider-to-population ratios; finally, an empirical study was conducted to verify the model’s advantages. We investigate accessibility to three tiers of healthcare facilities (including 22 tertiary hospitals, 88 secondary hospitals, and 55 community healthcare centres), and reveal disparities between supply and demand, via conjoint analysis of the accessibility of facilities and the population density under four associate patterns in the district of Wuhan at community scale (total 830 communities). Results: The results suggest that in terms of travel modes, the travel time and trip distance under the private car mode are shorter than these calculated under the public transport mode. Highly accessible communities are more concentrated in the central urban areas and distributed near a healthcare service centre, and community healthcare center have the greatest accessibility among the three tiers of healthcare. Moreover, statistical analysis highlights that distinct polarized differentiation appears in the number of communities with low and high accessibility, and more than half of the communities have accessibility levels that are inappropriate for their population size.
Conclusions
These findings may have important policy implications for health planners and decision-makers who must reasonably allocate public health resources.}

I mobilize affect as both a theoretical framework and an analytic to engage with geolocation as an instrumentality of intensities that organizes affects for platforms, which I term ‘platform affects’. I theorize platform affects as individual and collective orientations of attunement, predisposition, and/or incentivization towards using, contributing to, remaining within, and/or returning to platforms. Drawing on select empirical examples identified as part of a qualitative study, I identify that geolocation organizes five ‘platform affects’ for digital platform ecosystems: (i) affective space-times of hyperlocality and real-timeness; (ii) experiential affects of smoothness; (iii) affects of connectedness; (iv) affects of trust; and (v) affective value. Theorizing geolocation affectively adds explanatory power to the “dynamics driving the integration” of geolocation and digital systems (Alvaren León, 2016, p. 1). Simultaneously, engaging platforms via affects (of geolocation) advances an understanding of the ways in which platforms have come to secure and sustain prominence within dominant contemporary socialities defined by configurations of bodies, technologies, and other materialities that are themselves captured within and expressed through theories of affect (Clough, 2007).}

The work focuses on the study area of Shenzhen, a high-density urban context with an adequate amount of urban renewal cases and sufficient crowdsourced data. Results indicated that assessments based on the combination of crowdsourced datasets and traditional datasets were accurate and reliable for the residential and commercial land parcels. Furthermore, mass assessments at a fine spatial-temporal scale are viable if introduce crowdsourced datasets due to the cost of obtaining the crowdsourced data is much lower, and the spatial-temporal scale is much finer than investigated or surveyed data.}

The assumption that VGI is inferior to PGI is shown to be unfounded; rather each has its own strengths in describing particular aspects of the user information landscape. Considering the opportunities to influence user activities, both VGI and PGI have a greater ability to influence the user in the planning phase than actually during the activity. The importance of the author of the information (volunteer or professional) is shown to be of less importance to the end-user than the characteristics which describe the information in terms of communication, frequency of updates and accessibility.}

This paper examines these developments with regard to criticality, or the ways in which mapping practices are applied in critical research – both research that seeks to situate the emergence of geospatial technologies and enrolls these technologies more directly as method. What is the criticality of mapping practices amid these developments? More specifically to the design and planning fields, how might geodesign align with critical GIS? I take up these questions by tracing three presuppositions of criticality in mapping while examining the conditions of geodesign's emergence: representation and futurity, neutrality and efficacy, and relationality and complexity. I conclude by outlining a research agenda for further advancement of a critical geodesign.}

abstract = {The eastern Helan Mountains are one of the most important plantings and production bases for high-quality grapes in China. In winter, grape root is prone to freezing damage owing to natural phenomenon such as early and late frost, and methods to assess disaster risk at the grape parcel level is one of the current research hotspots. However, there are two problems at present; first is the lack of grape parcel maps and second is that scale of disaster risk assessment is limited to the level of administrative divisions and grid systems. Therefore, according to the perennial characteristics of the grapes and clear texture of the open-air grape parcels based on public data sets (Sentinel-2A/B) and high-quality winery address information, combined with Google Earth engine (GEE) platform, Google Earth, and Ovitalmap, this study designs a collection scheme of open-air grape parcel samples and non-grape parcel samples, analyzes the environmental characteristics of the distribution of high-quality wineries, constructs a classification feature database in three aspects (time, terrain, and vegetation), uses the random forest classification method to classify open-air grape parcels in the eastern Helan Mountains in 2019, and conducts a late frost disaster risk assessment of the open-air grape parcel. The results show that: (1) The high-quality wineries are mainly distributed in the elevation of 1106–1240 m, with the average slope of 0.82°, the organic matter content of 10.79–14.27 g/kg, the P content of 24.87–37.58 mg/kg, the K content of 116–166 mg/kg, the pH 8.38–8.55, N content of 0.65–0.98 g/kg, annual average active accumulated temperature ≥10 °C of 3490–3590 °C, annual average rainfall of 189–201 mm, the annual average sunshine duration of 7.3–7.6 h, annual average air temperature of 8.8–9.4 °C, annual average temperature difference of 12.7–13.2 °C, annual average frost-free period at 263–270 d and annual average relative air Humidity of 50–54%. (2) The overall classification accuracy of open-air grape parcels reached 98.96% and the verification accuracy of ground truth parcel samples reached 87.89%. The open-air grape parcels in the eastern Helan Mountains are mainly distributed in Helan County, Xixia District, Yongning County, and Qingtongxia City. (3) The highest risk of late frost was found in Xixia District and the lowest risk in Yongning County. Helan County was higher than Qingtongxia City in the medium risk of late frost. The typical small area high risk includes Liangtian Town, the experimental field of Ningxia Academy of Agricultural and Forestry Sciences in Zhenbeibao Town, Yuhuang Winery in Ganchengzi Village, and the State-run Warm Spring Farm in Helan County. Thus, the sample collection and augmentation scheme are feasible, the open-air grape classification accuracy is high and its result is consistent with field investigation, which can provide accurate parcel-level disaster risk assessment and provide decision support for agricultural departments and farmers.}

An alternative to surveys is to use information from social media. Here, we propose a novel salience index to quantify and compare CES provision for multiple user groups (local residents, researchers and visitors) of Catimbau National Park in Brazil using data derived from distinct methodologies: i) a traditional social survey; ii) an online survey, and iii) analysis of photos published on Flickr and Instagram. Our index allowed direct comparison between groups despite the data being collected using different approaches. As predicted, residents identified more locations providing CES and a higher overall diversity of CES. Correspondingly, researchers and visitors identified CES from a more restricted set of locations and were biased towards educational services and aesthetic value, respectively. Since multi-stakeholder, multi-method approaches are essential for a comprehensive understanding of CES, integrating results using standardized metrics such as our salience index will allow broad scale analysis of this poorly quantified class of ecosystem services.}

Three regression models, ordinary least squares regression, support vector machine, and random forest, were all calibrated using Landsat TM/ETM+ data and field observations from two sources: Environment Canada and the Weather Underground. Results based on cross-validation indicate that the random forest model produced the lowest prediction errors (RMSE=2.31°C). Some weather stations were consistently cooler/hotter than the reference station and were predicted well, while other stations, particularly those close to the ocean, showed greater temperature variability and were predicted with greater errors. A few stations, most of which were from the Weather Underground data set, were very poorly predicted and possibly unrepresentative of air temperature in the area. The random forest model generally produced a sensible map of temperature distribution in the area. The spatial regression approach appears useful for mapping intra-urban air temperature variability and can easily be applied to other cities.}

From climate change to GMOs (genetically modified organisms) to global epidemics such as Ebola and Zika, we need basic scientific knowledge to be able to make informed personal and policy decisions. At the same time, in a country where a questioning of facts has become ever more widespread, many look upon science and scientists with mistrust. Given these realities, this chapter provides an overview of science literacy in the U.S., issues around retention in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) fields, pubic engagement with science research, and the roles that academic libraries can play in this arena. It also includes an overview of the subsequent chapters.}

abstract = {Many studies have been conducted to create building information models (BIMs) or city information models (CIMs) as the digital infrastructure to support various smart city programs. However, automatic generation of such models for high-density (HD) urban areas remains a challenge owing to (a) complex topographic conditions and noisy data irrelevant to the buildings, and (b) exponentially growing computational complexity when the task is reconstructing hundreds of buildings at an urban scale. This paper develops a method - multi-Source recTification of gEometric Primitives (mSTEP) - for automatic reconstruction of BIMs in HD urban areas. By retrieving building base, height, and footprint geodata from topographic maps, level of detail 1 (LoD1) BIMs representing buildings with flat roof configuration were first constructed. Geometric primitives were then detected from LiDAR point clouds and rectified using architectural knowledge about building geometries (e.g. a rooftop object would normally be in parallel with the outer edge of the roof). Finally, the rectified primitives were used to refine the LoD1 BIMs to LoD2, which show detailed geometric features of roofs and rooftop objects. A total of 1361 buildings located in a four square kilometer area of Hong Kong Island were selected as the subjects for this study. The evaluation results show that mSTEP is an efficient BIM reconstruction method that can significantly improve the level of automation and decrease the computation time. mSTEP is also well applicable to point clouds of various densities. The research is thus of profound significance; other cities and districts around the world can easily adopt mSTEP to reconstruct their own BIMs/CIMs to support their smart city programs.}

While economic growth has brought prosperity and better living conditions, much of the human impact has had irreversible consequences on environmental systems and destroyed fragile ecosystems and biodiversity. One of the dimensions that most suffered from excessive pressure, and is albeit all very little assessed, is the regional spatial change in line with historical and archaeological heritage. Monitoring of these transitions is of utmost importance to guide best the directions of regional planning in future. I advance with explaining the crucial role that Geographic Information Systems can play for regional science in line with heritage, and define techniques for sounder interactions of urban areas and regions in line with complex representation of space. I conclude further, that we are witnessing different types of dynamics in the landscape settings, that can be defined as (i) the coherent landscape, (ii) the dominant landscape and (iii) the vertical landscape lagging under a concept defined as spatial memory of rapid changing regions. All together, a new paradigm where geodesign, spatial analysis and geocomputational advances are linked, regional science must consider a new paradigm which I designate as regional intelligence for a more sustainable future.}

Over the past two decades, the literature has provided three distinct methods for identifying and classifying the boundary of raster objects: the digital Jordan curve, the hyper-raster, and a marginal approach. While each approach has its own merits and drawbacks, there should be methods by which to convert one representation to another. This, however, is currently unattainable as the digital Jordan curve approach and the hyper-raster approach are formulated upon different domains of objects, with the more verbose digital Jordan curve approach serving as a subset of the hyper-raster approach with respect to objects which are simple regions in R2. This paper revisits the approach of the digital Jordan curve by removing the digital Jordan curve restriction, replacing it with the set of pixels that neighbor an exterior pixel, allowing for a host of different relations in pixel space. This increase in domain results in a set of 62 available 9-intersection matrices, a nearly four-fold increase from the original 16 matrices and demonstrates the novelty of this approach with respect to the egg-yolk relations, a model in R2 for relations between regions with broad boundaries.}

Typical land cover classifications for such purposes result from a top-down process and rely on expert conceptualisations, and thus provide limited space for incorporating more widely held views of key landscape elements. In this paper we introduce the notion of spatial folksonomies, which we define as a tuple linking a vocabulary of landscape terms through authors and resources to locations. We demonstrate how spatial folksonomies can automatically be created for Switzerland using two text corpora: the Swiss Alpine Club's yearbook for the past 150 years and user generated content from a website describing a wide range of outdoor activities. The spatial folksonomies capture variation in space of the use of nouns describing 96 natural landscape terms (e.g. ridge, forest, mountain, etc.) and allow us to characterise regions and compute similarities. We compare our spatial folksonomies to two traditional land cover/land use classifications (CORINE and Arealstatistik) and demonstrate that despite their very different sources, the approaches capture landscape variation in broadly similar ways. However, our spatial folksonomies provide new insights into how landscapes are described, through for example variation in space, time and through the prism of different activities. We argue that our spatial folksonomies are a novel way of capturing variation closer to the bottom-up understandings of landscape for instance required to describe cultural ecosystem services.}

Our review shows that (1) adaptive resilience is mapped after a disaster mainly through the measure of recovery and inherent resilience is mapped using top-down approaches. Regarding inherent resilience (2), very few methods have been applied at city scale; (3) the limit between resilience and vulnerability mapping is still narrow and may cause confusion for decision makers; (4) the choice of variables and indicators to measure and map resilience is often a function of data availability and reliability; (5) indicators developed in one specific context should not be applied systematically to other contexts as resilience is a context-dependent concept; (6) most resilience maps are based on an analytical approach and do not reflect the systemic property of resilience.}

abstract = {Microscopic traffic simulators have become efficient tools to conduct different analytic studies on roads, vehicles, behavior of drivers, and critical intersections, which lead towards a well-planned traffic solution. Devising a realistic and sustainable traffic solution requires replication of the real traffic scenario in a simulator. For example, to simulate the traffic stream of less developed countries, we need to simulate non-lane based heterogeneous traffic stream, i.e., motorized and non-motorized vehicles, with their on road behaviors such as irregular pedestrian, illegal parking, violation of laws pertaining lanes, etc. However, most of the existing traffic simulators are unable to mimic the unstructured road traffic stream of less developed countries with their diversified behaviors. We also need to represent the corresponding geographical maps as a list of nodes and edges with relevant geographic information such as length and width of the edges to feed the simulator. However, we lack a Geographic Information System (GIS) protocol to construct an effective simulator readable road network from authoritative polygonal GIS maps. State-of-the-art GIS protocol often converts the geographical maps using polyline data collected from less-credible OpenStreetMap. Although polyline data has length information (for example, length of a street), it lacks width information limiting its capability of being an effective simulator readable road network map. Therefore, in this work, we propose a new microscopic traffic simulator to handle unstructured road traffic stream of less developed countries with their diversified behaviors. To feed the simulator, we also propose a novel parsing algorithm to construct an effective simulator-readable road network from GIS maps through extracting both length and width information of the edges and develop parser based on the algorithm. Our parsing algorithm realizes a delicate blending of geometry with computation over road points to eventually generate the simulator-readable road network. Our simulator receives the network topology generated by our parser, traffic routes, and traffic demand flow rates as input, visualizes the traffic flows, and provides relevant traffic statistics. To evaluate sustainability of our proposed parser and simulator in real-life scenarios, we evaluate our parser by parsing GIS street maps of four different areas resulting in 86% accuracy on an average and evaluate our simulator after necessary calibration using real traffic data resulting in 99% accuracy in terms of travel time.}

Although mobile phones enable the user’s position to be located with a certain degree of accuracy from a large number of people and become one of the most promising devise, unwillingness to share related with privacy issues still remain. Therefore, it is also important to establish a practical method for reconstructing people flow from various kinds of existing fragmentary spatio-temporal data, such as public traffic survey data, from a view of complementariness with mobile phone data. In this study, we propose a combination of spatio-temporal correction processes to a previously published method, to generate continuous spatio-temporal people flow data sets at chosen intervals in selected cities. The correction methods include temporal smoothing of departure time using kernel density estimation, network data correction in OpenStreetMap data, and spatial smoothing in geocoding with MODIS data. We also compare the reconstruction accuracy by deriving correlation coefficients for different combinations of correction methods. Such reconstructed people flow data can potentially be used as infrastructure data in various fields, including emergency planning and related events in areas where data collection and real-time awareness are weak.}

Here we highlight what is understood by participation according to different actors and various international contexts. This study was motivated by a workshop where flood-risk and resilience experts from 14 countries perceived the nature of participation and the lack of its implementation differently. To unravel the multitude of these perspectives, 27 expert interviews were conducted in seven countries: Belgium, Germany, Indonesia, Iran, Nepal, Pakistan and Peru between March and August 2020. Results show that constraints on the conduction of participation are not only related to the specific country context but differ even within countries. Limitations such as capacities and willingness to participate as well as the role and importance of participation are common issues across the investigated contexts and countries.}

We used a web-based public participation GIS (PPGIS) approach to gather citizen data on visitor behaviour in Helsinki's Central Park in order to aid collaborative spatial decision-making. The study combined smartphone GPS tracking, route drawing and a questionnaire to examine differences between user groups in their use of formal trails, off-trail behaviour and the motivations that affect it. In our sample (n = 233), different activity types were associated with distinctive spatial patterns and potential extent of impacts. The density mapping and statistical analyses indicated three types of behaviour: predominantly on or close to formal trails (runners and cyclists), spatially concentrated off-trail behaviour confined to a few informal paths (mountain bikers), and dispersed off-trail use pattern (walkers and dog walkers). Across all user groups, off-trail behaviour was mainly motivated by positive attraction towards the environment such as scenic view, exploration, and viewing flora and fauna. Study findings lead to several management recommendations that were presented to city officials. These include reducing dispersion and the spatial extent of trampling impacts by encouraging use of a limited number of well-established informal paths away from sensitive vegetation and protected habitats.}

Previous food environment studies have revealed a disparity of access to healthful food on various geographical scales. An overlooked facet of this spatial perspective is the impact of the food environment at the individual level. Individuals tend to make diverse food purchasing and dining choices, including where, when, how, and which types of food to acquire. An unexplored avenue for further investigation is measuring the extent to which people's preference for food is elicited by exposure to their immediate food environment. This paper takes an innovative approach to this question by soliciting individual data about food-related activities from social media, or specifically, “tweets” (messages sent on Twitter). With spatiotemporally tagged information, tweets provide an ideal method for measuring the exposure to the food environment in real time. This measure, as a representative of individual food access, is associated with users' particular diet choices conveyed in their tweets. By comparing groups of Twitter users who shop in grocery stores to those who dine at fast food restaurants, we found that the prevalence of grocery stores that stock fresh produce within an individual's neighborhood may significantly influence him or her to make nutritious food choices. This study has a great potential to inform health professionals and stakeholders of the significance of social media in assisting with crowdsourcing human subject data that incorporate spatiotemporal dimensions and to explore individual diets in relation to their perceived food environment, which can positively impact the health of communities.}

In light of the limitations of previous flood exposure studies in the U.S, this study uses the recently released Microsoft building footprint dataset to capture the heterogeneity of population distribution at the micro-level. The population at block group level from ACS 5-year estimates (2013–2017) is further disaggregated to residential buildings, identified via NLUD 2010 and OpenStreetMap Land Use polygons. A comparative study is then conducted to investigate the 100-year flood exposure from FEMA and from the other three publicly available 100-year floodplains. Although the exposure analysis shows varying spatial patterns for selected floodplains, it indicates that a large number of exposed residents are found in regions where FEMA floodplain product is unavailable, presumably responsible for the uncaptured losses reported from other studies. In addition, the inequitably high flood risk experienced by the poor revealed at the national level underscores the significance of flood vulnerability studies to emphasize the need for this vulnerable group.}

Such evaluation is affected by the presence, configuration, colour, texture, etc. of different landscape attributes combined with respondent characteristics such as level of education, gender, age and environmental attitudes. The complexity of factors affecting preferences for visual quality raise the question of whether the objectifying of this kind of research is possible. That is why the aim of this paper is to determine if it is possible to generalise peoples' preferences on rural landscapes. This study developed the Index of Prognosis Rural Landscape Preferences (IPRLP), which is composed of nine variables referring to the presence or percentage share of different landscape attributes. The IPRLP was tested on 32 scenes of two regions located in Central Eastern Poland - the Polesie region and the Roztocze region. The index values were compared with real preferences expressed by respondents (n = 240). The results showed that this index was highly correlated with the respondents’ preferences (0.79 < r < 0.90), which indicates that objectivity of visual preferences studies are possibly based on the mathematical model. Stepwise multiple regression indicates three explanatory variables of the model: percentage of buildings (PB), presence of negative manmade objects (NE) and degree of naturalness (DN) indicating that it is easier to predict what kind of landscape people would not prefer than would prefer.}

In recent years, very high resolution (VHR) remote sensing imagery interpretation has resolved the “semantic gap” between the low-level data and the high-level semantic scenes, and has been used to map urban land use. Nevertheless, the existing frameworks cannot easily be applied to practical urban analysis, which can be attributed to three main reasons: 1) the indistinguishable socio-economic attributes of the same ground object layouts; 2) the weak transferability of the supervised frameworks and the time-consuming training sample annotation; and 3) the category system inconsistency between the data source and the urban land-use application. In this paper, to achieve an “application gap” breakthrough for urban land-use mapping, a data-driven point, line, and polygon semantic object mapping (PLPSOM) framework is proposed, which makes full use of open-source VHR images and multi-source geospatial data. In the PLPSOM framework, point, line, and polygon semantic objects are represented by the points of interest (POIs), OpenStreetMap (OSM) data, and VHR images corresponding to the scenes in the land-use mapping units, respectively. OSM line semantic objects are utilized to supply the boundaries of the land-use mapping units for the POIs and VHR images, forming urban land parcels (street blocks). To reduce the cost of the data annotation, the training dataset is constructed using multiple open-source data sources. An enhanced deep adaptation network (EDAN) is then proposed to acquire the categories of the VHR scene images in the case of partial transfer learning. Finally, in order to meet the actual needs, a rule-based category mapping (RCM) model is applied to integrate the categories of the POIs and VHR images into the urban land-use category system, allowing us to acquire the land-use maps of the cities. The effectiveness of the proposed method was tested in four cities of China, including six specific areas: Beijing and Wuhan city centers; the Hanyang District of Wuhan; the Hannan District of Wuhan; Macao; and the Wan Chai area of Hong Kong, achieving a high classification accuracy. The “urban image” analysis confirmed the practicality of the obtained urban land-use maps.}

An important step in the development of renovation strategy and energy conservation advising is to gather information of the energy performance of the existing buildings. However, renovation strategies must also consider the socio-economic challenges associated with the cost of energy retrofitting. This paper describes the development of an energy atlas of the multifamily building stock in Sweden for visualizing and analyzing energy use and renovation needs. The atlas has been developed using Extract Transform and Load technology (ETL) to aggregate information on the energy performance, building ownership, renovation status, and socio-economic status of inhabitants from various data sources. The atlas can visualize the energy use and renovation status of multifamily buildings in 2D maps and 3D models, displaying data for either individual buildings or aggregated data on spatial scales ranging from 250×250m squares through district and municipality to county areas. A demonstration of its use on national and city scales indicates that energy retrofits of multifamily buildings reaching a service life of 50years can reduce the energy use of the existing building stock by up to 50% relative to 1990. However, costs associated with renovation and energy retrofits of multifamily buildings can be problematic, especially in economically weak suburbs. A good understanding of past and future renovation needs and socio-economic consequences is important in the development of a sustainable national renovation strategy.}

The quantitative research method is applied to examine, the network centrality, network accessibility and network community partition focusing on the upper-layer (rail network) network growth process. We based on the case study of Kuala Lumpur and found that when a rail network grows with a simple tree-like network to a more intricate form, the network diameter and the average shortest path length of multi-layer networks decrease dramatically. The network expansion ability keeps changing and more rail stations in the city centre have higher ability for future expansion. Changes in betweenness centrality and closeness centrality of multi-layer networks essentially hinge on the growth of rail network, with the highest change rate of closeness centrality at around 211.48%. The growth of network allows the remainder of the network to be easily visited, with the highest change rate of network accessibility around 12%. Different performances of these nodes added in the multi-layer network are discussed to show their impact on the repartition of network communities and the number of communities is decreasing. We believe this research can benefit scholars to easily understand and apply these network dynamic computational techniques.}

abstract = {Although the benefit of participatory sensing for collecting local data over large areas has long been recognized, it has not been widely used for various applications such as disaster preparation due to a lack of geospatial localization capability with respect to a distant object. In such applications, objects of interest need to be robustly localized and documented for supporting data-driven decision-making in site inspection and resource mobilization. However, participatory sensing is inappropriate to localize a distant object due to the absence of ranging sensors in citizens' mobile devices; thus, the localization accuracy varies to a large extent. To address this issue, this study presents a novel geospatial localization method for distant objects based on participatory sensing. The proposed geospatial localization process consists of multiple computational modules—a geographic coordinate conversion, mean-shift clustering, deep learning-based object detection, magnetic declination adjustment, line of sight equation formulation, and the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse method—to improve the localization accuracy in participatory sensing environments. The experiments were conducted in Houston and College Station in Texas to evaluate the proposed method, and the experimental results demonstrated a reasonable localization accuracy, recording the distance errors of 1.5 m to 27.8 m when the distance from observers to the objects of interest were 17 m to 296 m. The proposed method is expected to contribute to rapid data collection over large urban areas, thereby facilitating disaster preparedness that needs to identify locations of distant objects at risk.}

This study assesses the spatial accuracy of PPGIS data collected for conservation planning in two regions of New Zealand in 2011 by comparing participant mapped locations of native vegetation with areas identified in the New Zealand Land Cover Database (LCDB) Version 2. Spatial error was operationalized as PPGIS locations having no native vegetation within 1000m. The results indicate relatively low PPGIS spatial error of about 6% compared to 22% for randomly selected point locations in the regions. Spatial error is largest in coastal regions and near population centers where native vegetation is sparse and patchy. Participant familiarity with the study region is related to spatial error and is reflected in PPGIS sampling groups, with randomly sampled households having the largest error rate and the self-selected public, the lowest error rate. The results indicate a competitive, trade-off relationship between PPGIS participation rates and spatial accuracy. Future PPGIS research should identify processes with the capacity to increase both participation and spatial accuracy concurrently.}

However, although the current works in this area have sought to provide a more accurate and better technological infrastructure of systems to support these tasks, they have failed to examine key features that may affect the decision-making. In light of this, this paper aims to provide an understanding of the decision-making process in control rooms for disaster risk monitoring and early warning. This understanding is underpinned by a conceptual framework, which has been developed in this work and describes factors that influence the decision-making. For doing so, data were collected through a series of semi-structured interviews and participatory observations and later evaluated with members of the control room of the Brazilian Center for Monitoring and Early Warning of Natural Disasters (Cemaden). The study findings provided a solid basis for designing the conceptual framework of the essential factors required by the decision-makers. These factors are separated into two groups: 1) the “dimensions” of decision-making (i.e., the type of hazard, the phase of the disaster risk, the location, and area of expertise of the operators) and the “pillars” of decision-making (i.e., the tasks, their required information, useful data sources, and the decision rule). Finally, the contributions achieved in this study may help operators to understand and propose proactive measures that could improve their decision-making, overcome uncertainties, standardize the team's decision-making, and put less pressure on operators.}

In response to the European Commission’s Communication on Green Infrastructure from 2013, the GREEN SURGE project aimed to further advance the development of UGI in European cities by (i) strengthening the conceptual foundations of UGI, (ii) developing improved methods and tools for assessment of its state, benefits and governance and, (iii) applying these to build a stronger evidence base. This paper aims to provide an overall synthesis of the project’s main achievements. GREEN SURGE adopted an inter- and transdisciplinary approach. Urban Learning Labs and focal Learning Alliances in five cities were instrumental for intensive collaboration between disciplines and across science and practice. Pan-European surveys, e.g. of planning and governance practice or human-nature interactions established the state-of-the-art across the continent and identified good practices. The project consolidated green infrastructure planning and governance conceptually, and it mapped opportunities for better linking government-led planning with bottom-up initiatives for creating and managing UGI. It also introduced a framework for knowledge integration to support UGI valuation. Importantly, development and application of the concept of biocultural diversity gave new insights into human–nature relationships in multicultural urban societies. The results strongly call for more context-sensitive development of UGI that addresses the different needs and diverse cultural practices of people engaging with nature. In a nutshell, GREEN SURGE showed that UGI indeed can make a major contribution to sustainable and resilient urbanisation. Transdisciplinary research in urban labs, if well-conceived, has shown to hold great potential to advance UGI concepts, methods, knowledge and practice.}

The place-based thoughts and feelings of an individual do not, however, always fit well with the space-based points and polygons into which they are typically reduced in such a system, which can limit the effectiveness of many traditional PPGIS' for data collection. In order to address this issue, an alternative PPGIS platform is presented, which allows the collection, storage and analysis of spatial data from the public without the requirement to artificially reduce these data to geographic primitives. The ‘Spraycan’ platform allows participants to create spatial representations on a map using a familiar airbrush-style interface, permitting the creation of vague regions and boundaries that better reflect the places to which they refer. Data are stored within a ‘multi-point-and-attribute’ data structure whereby each individual ‘dot’ of ‘paint’ created using the airbrush is stored as a discrete geographical object, and is joined to all other associated ‘dots’, as well as a variety of other demographic and contextual data, including free-text data in which the participants may add context to their spray patterns. The flexibility of this data structure provides a wide and extensible variety of analytical choices for the researcher, as is shown here by an example study demonstrating the use of the Spraycan for decision-support, as well as a number of real-world ‘in the wild’ applications. It is hoped that this work will open up the agenda for alternative PPGIS interfaces, in order to further explore the possibilities associated with the capture and analysis of ‘fuzzy’ place-based data.}

Over the past few years, two approaches to the assessment of spatial-emotional interactions have emerged: the assessment of emotion using subjective self-reported measures and the exploration of objective physiological measures of emotional arousal using ambulatory sensing techniques. To date, most empirical research exploring spatial-emotional interactions has focused on the individual level. The present study is the first to systematically map the emotional characteristics of a large-scale urban environment using aggregative measures of emotion (subjective and objective). By mapping the subjective emotional experience of 144 individuals through real-time surveys administered through Experience Sampling Methods (ESM) as well as mapping an objective physiological measurement of emotional arousal (Skin Conductance Level) of 68 tourists, we were able to create ‘emotional maps’ of the city of Jerusalem. The maps identify emotionally arousing areas of the city, point to emotional ‘clusters’ and ‘boundaries’, and identify discontinuities (and continuities) in emotional space throughout the city. The theoretical and practical implications of this new method for planning and policy are discussed.}

One of the most affected cities was Copiapó (northern Chile) located downstream of the junction between the Copiapó river and its ephemeral tributary Quebrada Paipote. This work analyses the features of this catastrophic flood and relates them with the identified impacts. A large volume of water mixed with fine sediments overflowed the tributary channel generating a flood that affected 72% of the urban area. The rheological (velocity, density and flow regime) and sedimentary features of the flow reveal the occurrence of massive mudflows that infilled the space available inside the buildings, buried the streets with a sandy mud deposit of more than 30 cm medium thickness and collapsed the sewer network. The post-event survey carried out by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Planning (MINVU) was used for the development of fragility curves that allows modelling the probability of damage. Results indicate that the greatest probability of building damage is generated by the accumulation of sediments instead of by the flow depth. On the other hand, once the very fine grain sediments of the top of the deposit dried up, it increased the concentration of post-event suspension particulate matter, causing a health issue. This work highlights the need to understand mudflow processes and their consequences in arid environments to improve urban planning and mitigate future damages since their impacts strongly affect infrastructures and communities.}

In the first stage, we extract measures of the morphology and neighbourhood characteristics from readily available topographic mapping, a high-resolution Digital Surface Model and statistical boundary data. These measures are then used as features within a random forest classifier to infer an age category for each building. We evaluate various predictive model combinations based on scenarios of available data, evaluating these using 5-fold cross-validation to train and tune the classifier hyper-parameters based on a sample of city properties. A separate sample estimated the best performing cross-validated model as achieving 77% accuracy. In the second stage, we improve the inferred per-building age classification (for a spatially contiguous neighbourhood test sample) through aggregating prediction probabilities using different methods of spatial reasoning. We report on three methods for achieving this based on adjacency relations, near neighbour graph analysis and graph-cuts label optimisation. We show that post-processing can improve the accuracy by up to 8 percentage points.}

abstract = {In order to produce precise outcomes, most spatial simulations require great volumes of data input, intensive data preparation or programming skills. Consequently, high quality spatial simulations are usually not applied in practice in municipalities of smaller size (<25,000 citizens). This study aims to provide an easy-to-use tool for smaller urban administrations. A web application was developed which requires a minimum of manual user input for automated data preparation. Gamified elements aim to encourage the user to experience the underlying mechanisms of the system under alternating planning scenarios. These mechanisms are modelled as a combination of spatially implicit and explicit rules which can be derived from dependencies in the data itself. Spatial attractiveness was modelled as a function of accessibility of facilities, ground value, soil sealing, traffic intensity and noise pollution in a multi-variate spatial autoregressive regression analysis. A case study for the city center of Herdecke (Germany) revealed that the establishment of a new event location in the northern part of the study area was most appropriate for increasing spatial attractiveness. The presented easy-to-use tool is suitable for practical application in everyday administrative processes of smaller municipalities and thereby contributes to more applied sustainable urban planning.}

However, adequate training sample collection and mapping accuracy are two hindering factors over large regions. Here we propose a new framework for efficient human settlement extraction from Landsat images over large areas. First, an inventory-based training set is adopted to obtain some statistical parameters required to build a non-settlement mask. The mask can not only reduce unnecessary computation but also reduce the impact of background noise. Thereafter, for the un-masked areas we calculate the similarity of each image pixel to pre-collected sample points, and only those within certain threshold are treated as the settlement class. This approach is very fast and has been applied to three rapidly developing regions in China. Accuracy assessment indicates that the mean overall accuracies are 87%, 89% and 89% for Jing-Jin-Ji region, Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta, respectively. This work may be applied to human settlement extraction at even broader spatial scales.}

Although a large number of evacuation models has been reported in the literature, many used census survey data which represent only the nighttime population distribution. To fill this research gap, this paper introduces a novel data integration framework for developing an evacuation decision support system for wildfire, Integrated Wildfire Evacuation Decision Support System (IWEDSS). IWEDSS integrates multiple data sources including social media, census survey, geographic information systems (GIS) data layers, volunteer suggestions, and remote sensing data. The integration is based on multi-disciplinary theoretical and modeling approaches including Geographic Information Science, civil and transportation engineering, computer science, social media and communication. IWEDSS includes four core modules: dynamic population estimation, stage-based robust evacuation planning, social perception analysis, and web-based geomatical analytic platform. It offers tools for evacuation planers and resource managers to make better decisions that can reduce the evacuation time and potential number of injuries and deaths. This paper also presents a case study to demonstrate the suitability of incorporating social media data to estimate the dynamic change of human population.}

One option that has previously been utilized to assess cholera risk is spatial video. Here it is used to map potential mosquito breeding sites in an endemic Dengue and Chikungunya, and emerging Zika impacted community. We show how this method can provide mapping support in the hands of non-specialist public health workers who, working in collaboration with out-of-area geographic information systems (GIS) teams, can identify where to target limited intervention resources. We use a case study of an impoverished informal style Nicaraguan community suffering from a high disease burden to show spatial variation in potential mosquito breeding habitats. A field team collected street-by-street spatial video data to produce fine scale risk maps of standing water and trash locations, which, when interpreted with the associated spatial video imagery, were used to suggest where intervention strategies should be targeted. We also discuss how these same data layers can be used to address other health concerns traditionally found in informal settlements.}

In this research, we first identify a range of diverse factors that travelers take into account in their route choice decision in the network. A stated preference survey is conducted to show the heterogeneity in the preferences of users and its dependence to the purpose of the trips over the weekdays and weekends. Interestingly, results of the survey show that road safety is the most influential factor in the route choice decision of the average participants over weekends, exceeding even the travel time, and participants give more importance to the scenic quality of the routes for their weekend trips in comparison to their weekday trips. The results of the second part of the survey also indicate that in 27% of the cases participants choose routes other than the ones suggested by navigation systems, and 33% of the times that they take the suggested routes, they modify these routes according to their own preferences. The partial inability of existing navigation systems to suggest the routes that match the preferences of users can be attributed to ignoring (1) the diversity in influential factors and (2) the heterogeneity in preferences of the users by these systems. We propose a dynamic mixed logit route choice model to include the effects of information and learning to estimate parameters of a multivariable utility function for individual users based on their own historical route choice data over time. Finally, we present the concept of a smart navigation system that can gather the required information from real-time and online sources to suggest the routes that best match the users’ own preferences.}

Planning policies support the development of healthy, liveable cities. Yet, recent research suggests they may not offer enough detail to provide on-the-ground delivery of social and transport infrastructure that supports and impacts healthy, active behaviours and the subjective wellbeing of residents in new developments and growth areas.
Methods
Three analyses were conducted. First, planning policies were reviewed using a content analysis to identify environmental features known to support healthy and active behaviours. Then, for two growth area estates located in Melbourne, Australia (Allura and Selandra Rise), the on-the-ground delivery of these planning policies were evaluated using spatial data of key destinations (e.g., shops, schools, and transport) and geographic information systems analysis. Finally, the health and subjective wellbeing of adult residents from these two estates combined (n = 352) was assessed using survey methodology. This included asking residents about the importance and satisfaction with access to transport and key destinations.
Results
We found that many built environment features were mentioned in the policy documents; however policy standards for dwelling density remain low at 15 dph and distances for accessing activity centres too long at 1 km to adequately support the walkability of new growth areas. We found generally, that average distances to key destinations were longer and more variable in growth areas in comparison to inner city areas and Greater Melbourne overall. For residents, satisfaction with access to destinations differed between the two case study areas. Residents in Allura, where destination and transport access was generally poorer were less satisfied, whilst those in the more walkable and established Selandra Rise area were more satisfied.
Conclusions
Although planning policies support the development of active transport and healthy, liveable cities they are insufficient for influencing healthy behaviours when not well implemented. Early delivery of social and transport infrastructure and services must occur early in the development cycle of new growth areas to support healthier and more sustainable behaviours.}

Combined with cloud-based computing resources, and data collection through the crowd, these solutions have substantially improved possibilities for monitoring changes in land resources, especially in areas with difficult accessibility and data scarcity. In this study, we developed and tested a participatory mapping methodology utilizing the open data catalogues and cloud computing capacity to map the previously unknown extent and species composition of forest plantations in the Southern Highlands area of Tanzania, a region experiencing a rapid growth of smallholder-owned woodlots. A large set of reference data, focusing on forest plantation coverage, species and age information distribution, was collected in a two-week participatory GIS campaign where 22 Tanzanian experts interpreted very high-resolution satellite images in Google Earth with the Open Foris Collect Earth tool developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. The collected samples were used as training data to classify a multi-sensor image stack of Landsat 8 (2013–2015), Sentinel-2 (2015–2016), Sentinel-1 (2015), and SRTM derived elevation and slope data layers into a 30 m resolution forest plantation map in Google Earth Engine. The results show that the forest plantation area was estimated with high overall accuracy (85%). The interpretation accuracy of local experts was high considering general definition of forest plantation declining with increased details in interpretation attributes. The results showcase the unique value of local expert participation, enabling the collection of thousands of reference samples over a large geographical area in a short period of time simultaneously building the capacity of the experts. However, sufficient training prior to the data collection is crucial for the interpretation success especially when detailed interpretation is conducted in complex landscapes. Since the methodology is built on open-access data and software, it presents a highly feasible solution for repetitive land resource mapping applicable at different spatial scales globally.}

Despite a growing number of studies on mapping cultural ecosystem services, most are local-scale assessments that rely on costly and time-consuming primary data collection. As a result, the availability of spatial information on non-market values associated with cultural ecosystem services (social values) remains limited. Spatial function transfer, if it could be justified for social-value models, would expedite the development of social-value information and promote its more regular inclusion in ecosystem service assessments. We used survey data from six national forests in Colorado and Wyoming to explore the potential for transferring cultural ecosystem service models between forests and specifically to test the hypothesis that transfer performance increases with social-context similarity between transferring and receiving areas. Results confirm this relationship but fall just short of being able to predict with certainty when transferred models will meet the minimum performance criterion needed for defensible use by managers. Our results suggest that with the right combination of indicators spatial function transfer can become a defensible means of generating social-value information when primary data collection is not feasible.}

However, these powerful methods often fail to perform pattern analysis and knowledge mining with spatial vector data because in most cases, such data are not underlying grid-like or array structures but can only be modeled as graph structures. The present study introduces a novel graph convolution by converting it from the vertex domain into a point-wise product in the Fourier domain using the graph Fourier transform and convolution theorem. In addition, the graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) architecture is proposed to analyze graph-structured spatial vector data. The focus of this study is the classical task of building pattern classification, which remains limited by the use of design rules and manually extracted features for specific patterns. The spatial vector data representing grouped buildings are modeled as graphs, and indices for the characteristics of individual buildings are investigated to collect the input variables. The pattern features of these graphs are directly extracted by training labeled data. Experiments confirmed that the GCNN produces satisfactory results in terms of identifying regular and irregular patterns, and thus achieves a significant improvement over existing methods. In summary, the GCNN has considerable potential for the analysis of graph-structured spatial vector data as well as scope for further improvement.}

While such threats have been mapped, their uncertainties from different climate scenarios and longer planning horizons have yet to be addressed from both an exposure assessment and a stakeholder outreach perspective. Therefore, we chose the highly urbanized San Francisco Bay Area as an example to project its flood areas every 20 years between 2000 and 2100, under 24 varied climate scenarios with two greenhouse gas (GHG) concentration levels. We then assessed flood exposure by intersecting the flood areas with demographic and socioeconomic distributions, developed areas, lifeline infrastructures, and emergency responders in low elevation (<10 m) coastal zones. Our median estimates under the low GHG scenarios indicated that 10–38% of the items assessed above are flood-exposed in 2000–2020, with this exposure increasing to 20–54% during 2080–2100. The median estimates under the high GHG scenarios for the same periods are 0–35% and 40–67%, respectively. The expected uncertainties, or standard deviations, of the exposures for a given item assessed above under the low and high GHG scenarios are 1–2% in 2000–2020 and 7–10% in 2080–2100. Despite our modeling capability for a range of climate scenarios over the long term, some stakeholders, particularly those in the private sector, prefer near-term results with lower uncertainties. This implies the need for coastal urban areas to cope with climate-related uncertainties and to focus on the long term when developing strategies and policies for climate change adaptation.}

The study builds on survey data and spatial data from three urban contexts of Beijing, Gothenburg and Malmo to analyse both individual-level and contextual factors influencing sustainable travel behaviour. The results indicate that despite varying contexts, the three dimensions of attitude, skills and access significantly explain individuals’ travel behaviour and their choice to travel by public transport, bicycle or car. Among the studied travel modes, cycling appears to be a competitive mode when the travel distances are within 5 km. In all three urban contexts, individuals who have greater environmental awareness are more likely to travel by public transport or cycling if the physical conditions facilitate using these modes. Good access to public transport is likely to increase the usage of both cycling and public transport and reduce car use. Favourable conditions for cycling within 2 km and 5 km radius can positively encourage people to use a bicycle as a feeder mode for public transport. Overall, our findings demonstrate that for mobility policies to increase individuals’ motility in relation to sustainable travel modes and encourage a travel behaviour shift towards using alternatives to cars, planners need to take more holistic approaches and design policies that deal with the three motility dimensions in an integrated manner and avoid focusing on a single dimension in isolation.}

Public participation GIS (PPGIS) survey methods were implemented in two separate study areas in Norway to identify ecosystem values and to analyze their spatial association with land cover data. The ecosystem value associations with land cover were generally consistent with global findings reported elsewhere, with forested areas providing multiple ecosystem “bundles” supporting both recreation-related and provisioning values. Alternative value transfer methods were demonstrated using recreation value to compare actual with predicted distributions using land cover indices derived from value proportions, deviations from expected distribution, and correlation coefficients with ecosystem value bundles. The use of simple ecosystem value percentages located within land cover classes provided the best predictive results for value transfer in this study. The limitations and potential for value transfer methods based on spatial associations between mapped ecosystem values and physical landscape characteristics are discussed.}

abstract = {Until recently, little attention has been paid to geocoding positional accuracy and its impacts on accessibility measures; estimates of disease rates; findings of disease clustering; spatial prediction and modeling of health outcomes; and estimates of individual exposures based on geographic proximity to pollutant and pathogen sources. It is now clear that positional errors can result in flawed findings and poor public health decisions. Yet the current state-of-practice is to ignore geocoding positional uncertainty, primarily because of a lack of theory, methods and tools for quantifying, modeling, and adjusting for geocoding positional errors in health analysis. This paper proposes a research agenda to address this need. It summarizes the basics of the geocoding process, its assumptions, and empirical evidence describing the magnitude of geocoding positional error. An overview of the impacts of positional error in health analysis, including accessibility, disease clustering, exposure reconstruction, and spatial weights estimation is presented. The proposed research agenda addresses five key needs: (1) a lack of standardized, open-access geocoding resources for use in health research; (2) a lack of geocoding validation datasets that will allow the evaluation of alternative geocoding engines and procedures; (3) a lack of spatially explicit geocoding positional error models; (4) a lack of resources for assessing the sensitivity of spatial analysis results to geocoding positional error; (5) a lack of demonstration studies that illustrate the sensitivity of health policy decisions to geocoding positional error.}

abstract = {This paper presents an interdisciplinary study of the spatiotemporal dynamics of seismic exposure. Out of the three components of risk—hazard, exposure, and vulnerability—exposure is the least studied, and is commonly treated as being constant in time. This approach neglects the dynamics associated with rapid development and urbanization, misrepresenting exposure in risk assessments. In this paper, mixed research methods are used to understand the dynamics of exposure in Santiago, the capital of Chile, between 1992 and 2017. First, residential exposure is modelled for three epochs using census data and public databases. Then, semi-structured interviews are conducted with local experts in engineering, planning, and disaster risk reduction to unveil the role of earthquake risk information in urban policy and development. Results show a steady expansion and densification of the city over the last 25 years, which is expected to continue in the future. The preferred building material for this growth is reinforced concrete, which rises from 3 to 17% as a proportion of the total structures in the city. It is also found that urban planning policy is disconnected from earthquake risk, which is perceived as a non-issue due to high local compliance with seismic codes. Thus, the continuous growth and homogenization of the built environment creates a singular dependence and blind trust in the local seismic academic and professional communities to provide earthquake resilience through safe buildings. These conditions configure a fragile but highly enabling environment for increasing seismic resilience in the city.}

We present findings from the pilot phase of an on-going case study in Keskuspuisto (Central park), Helsinki, Finland. The study employs an inventive and inexpensive approach for participatory data collection i.e. gathering GPS data from recreational users who have already recorded their routes for purposes other than research, using any kind of sports tracking application on their personal mobile phones. We used the SGT data to examine visitor spatial patterns on formal trails and informal paths, and present examples with runners and mountain bikers. Hotspot mapping of mountain bikers’ off-trail movement was conducted identifying several locations with clustering of off-trail use. Small-scale field mapping of three hotspot areas confirmed that the method accurately located areas of high use intensity where visible effects of path widening and high level of wear on the forest floor vegetation could be observed. We conclude that the SGT methodology offers great opportunities for gathering useful and up-to-date spatial information for adaptive planning and management as it highlights areas where conservation and visitor management measures may need to be adjusted. We suggest that this method warrants testing also for other user-centred research and planning purposes.}

We now depend on it for navigating vehicles, for route finding and we use it in our everyday lives to extract information about our locations and to track our movements. The latter use offers a potential alternative to more traditional sources of movement data through the construction of trip trajectories and, ultimately, the construction of origin-destination flow matrices. The advantage of being able to use GPS-derived movement data is that such data are potentially much richer than traditional sources of movement data both temporally and spatially. GPS-derived movement data potentially allow the calibration of spatial interaction models specific to very short time intervals, such as daily or even hourly, and for user-specified origins and destinations. Ultimately, it should be possible to calibrate continuously updated models in near real-time. However, the processing of GPS data into trajectories and then origin-destination flow matrices is not straightforward and is not well understood. This paper describes the process of transferring GPS tracking data into matrices that can be used to calibrate spatial interaction models. An example is given using retail behaviour in two towns in Scotland with an origin-constrained spatial interaction model calibrated for each day of the week and under different weather conditions (normal, rainy, windy). Although the study is small in terms of individuals and spatial context, it serves to demonstrate a future for spatial interaction modelling free from the tyranny of temporally static and spatially predefined data sets.}

abstract = {Global distribution of urban lands is one of the essential pieces of information necessary for urban planning. However, large disagreement exists among different products and the uncertainty remains difficult to quantify. We applied a Bayesian approach to map the uncertainties of global urban lands. We demonstrated the approach by producing a hybrid global urban land map that synthesized five different urban land maps in ca. 2000 at 1-km resolution. The resulting hybrid map is a posterior probability map with pixel values suggesting the probability of being urban land, which is validated by 30-m higher resolution references. We also quantified the minimum and maximum urban areas in 2000 for each country/continent based on subjective probability thresholds (i.e., 0.9 and 0.1) on our hybrid urban map. Globally, we estimated that the urban land area was between 377,000 and 533,000 km2 in 2000. The credible interval of minimum/maximum urban area can help guide future studies in estimating urban areas. In addition to providing uncertainty information, the hybrid map also achieves higher accuracy than individual maps when it is converted into a binary urban/non-urban map using a probability threshold of 0.5. This new method has the ability to further integrate discrete site/location-based data, local, regional, and global urban land maps. As more data is sequentially integrated, the accuracy is expected to improve. Therefore, our hybrid map should not be regarded as a final product, but a new prior product for future synthesis and integration toward a “big data” solution.}

These differences require new paradigms for thinking about maps and their objectives generally, and for thinking more specifically about how information is represented and disseminated through Cybercartography. In this chapter, the authors examine the nature of TK and the potential of Cybercartography for its representation. The authors consider the role of law (defined as explicit and enforceable rules) and normativity (defined as ‘ought’ statements that guide social relations) in shaping relationships between cartographers and the contributors of TK. They consider how those involved in such projects can use both technological and legal tools to define the terms of their collaboration and to articulate their expectations in sharing their information with a global community.}

However, due to a lack of knowledge on individual urban green spaces on the site level, further research on enhanced methods is needed to underpin existing assumptions about the reasons why people are visiting urban green spaces and what kinds of ecosystem services they can expect, with a focus on recreational activities. We argue for enhanced methods to assess supply of and demand on cultural UESS that should include the direct work with urban green space users. With the overall aim of developing a Spatial Decision Support System for visiting urban green spaces, we are applying a set of different quantitative methods to gather information on peoples’ needs and perceptions as well as data on what existing green spaces offer them. We present a two-step approach 1) linking green space criteria with recreational activities (demand-side) based on a linear series of three online surveys and 2) conducting a spatial mapping of urban green space criteria based on activity-driven indicators (supply-side). In the course of exemplified indicators operationalized by using open and local authorities′ geospatial data in an explorative study in Dresden and Heidelberg (Germany), we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the approach.}

abstract = {Understanding the complex impact of air pollution is crucial to assessing exposure risk and defining public health policies in China. However, the evidence and hence knowledge of how urban activity responds to air pollution are limited. In this paper, we propose to use geotagged check-in records on Weibo, a Tweeter-like platform, to systematically investigate the effect of air pollution on urban activity. Based on panel models, we found clear evidence that such effect exists and varies between pollutants, visitors and residents, and different activity types. Typically, SO2 has the largest impact, followed by PM2.5, NO2, and PM10; local citizens' activities are more susceptible than visitors; leisure-related activity has a sensitivity at least twofold higher than work-related activities. Additionally, we tested hypotheses about the heterogeneous effect. We confirmed the role of Income and air quality, showing that people who live in richer and more polluted cities are more likely to experience the effects of air pollution. Specifically, people who live in a more polluted city with 100 unit increments in AvgAQI show on average the same sensitivity as those who live in a less polluted city and earn about 20.3 thousand yuan more in average Income. This reveals new insights about environmental injustice in China. By presenting a portrait of the spatial heterogeneity, we argued that environmental injustice in terms of air pollution is not just about the difference in exposure risk measured based on population distribution, rather the measurement should also consider the disparity derived from urban activity. Secondly, new injustice may arise in underdeveloped areas where manufacture industry is transferred to but people barely take avoidance behavior. Finally, the map also reveals the general neglect of the detrimental effect of light air pollution, which we speculate is partly due to China's comparatively low standard in governmental regulations. We believe our finding contributes significantly to exposure risk assessment and environmental justice debates. Hence it highlights the necessity and urgency of public healthy polices that spread the health consequence of air pollution, especially in the underdeveloped region.}

In this chapter, we demonstrate how the principles of citizen science—the intrinsic involvement of nonscientist local stakeholders throughout the entire life cycle of a project—have the potential to complement and benefit those of IWRM; in particular, in relation to creating scientific evidence that underpins the governance of water resources. The rapid, recent development of information and communication technologies such as the Internet, smartphones, and social media has already demonstrated their capacity to make knowledge creation and governance more multidirectional, decentralized, diverse, and inclusive. We show how such new technologies can be harnessed with a citizen science approach to interrogate different aspects of the water cycle. One particularly promising development is to support citizen science with robust and low-cost sensor and networking technology. Such networks offer not only improved data coverage (especially in remote or data-scarce regions) but also enhanced sustainability at a time when monitoring networks are in decline globally. We argue that, in certain cases, citizen science and polycentric governance approaches can enrich and complement IWRM and merit greater attention.}

Government mandates such as the INSPIRE European Directive recommend standards for sharing resources (e.g., data and processes) with the goal of improving environmental (and related) decision making. Although SDIs present benefits to data providers in terms of data sharing and management, most geospatial infrastructures have been built following a top-down approach in which official providers (most commonly mapping agencies) are permitted to deploy and maintain resources. Because the mechanisms to deploy resources in these infrastructures are technologically complex, there has been limited participation from users, resulting in a scarcity of deployed resources. To address these limitations, we present a distributed architecture based on INSPIRE principles and extended with a Service Framework component. This component improves ad hoc integration and deployment of geospatial data resources within geospatial information infrastructures. The Service Framework addresses the need to improve the availability of geospatial data resources by providing mechanisms to assist users in wrapping resources to generate INSPIRE-based services.}

Our method is based on the combination and transfer of a Lancasterian function of biophysical aspects and a travel cost model based on agents' sociodemographic characteristics. We further validate the usefulness of the proposed recreation model by using it in the evaluation of a regional park charter pursuing two main objectives: recreational attractiveness and habitat quality (modeled with InVEST). The results demonstrate first that the biophysical context plays a large role in the recreational trip choice and thus should not be ignored in travel cost studies. Second, from a policy guidance perspective, we show that providing spatial information appears particularly critical for ES to be a useful lever for action in day-to-day decision-making.}

As active involvement of owners, investors and urban managers in urban renovation increases the success of renewal projects, more considerable attention has been paid to owner-investor participatory models in the last few decades. In order to promote participatory urban renewal processes, a Spatial (GIS-based) Decision Support System (SDSS) has been developed. The primary objective of proposed SDSS is to present a general framework for the involvement of owners, investors, and urban managers in UBA processes. Through the integration of Public Participation Geographic Information System (PPGIS) with Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA), the proposed SDSS provides an appropriate tool for the facilitation of participatory renewal procedures in UBAs. In addition to entering, storing, manipulating, analyzing and representing spatial data related to UBAs, the system provides further features for stakeholders including spatial negotiation, weighting, prioritization, validation, monitoring, and decision rule capabilities. The SDSS has been implemented in Tehran, and its quality has been validated from the perspective of developers, experts, and end users (owners and investors) in accordance with the ISO/IEC_9126 standard.

abstract = {The actual functions of a region may not reflect the intent of the original zoning scheme from planners. To identify the actual urban functional regions, numerous methods have been proposed with computational advancement. Specifically, remote sensing by image recognition, geodemographic classification, social sensing with big data and geo-text mining techniques have been widely applied. Points-of-interest (POIs) are one of the most common open-access data type used to extract information pertaining to functional zones. However, previous works have either lost sight or did not make full use of the spatial interactions that can be extracted from POIs due to model limitations in the context of geographical space. In this research, we introduced an approach that detects functional regions at the scale of a neighborhood area (NA) by combining POI data and a simplified Place2vec model, which is theorized from the first law of geography. First, the POI-based spatial context is constructed by using the nearest neighbor approach. Then, we can increase the number of training tuples (tcenter,tcontext) based on the weight derived from the distance between the POI tcenter and POI tcontext. Next, high-dimensional characteristic vectors of the POIs are extracted by using the skip-gram training framework. By summarizing the POI vectors at the NA level, we employ a K-means clustering model to cluster the functional regions. Compared with other probabilistic topic models (PTMs) and Word2vec, the Place2vec-based approach obtained the highest mean reciprocal rank value (MRR-SWP=0.356, MRR-SLC=0.401, MRR-SJC=0.433, and MRR-SLin=0.421) in terms of similarity capturing performance and functional region identification accuracy (OA=0.7424). The research has important implications to urban planning and governance.}

abstract = {Network distance and travel times are two popular methods of measuring potential geographic accessibility and networks are also used in gravity model-based approaches such as floating catchment area (FCA) techniques. Although some research has been conducted to assess the effectiveness of the representation of demand- (population) or supply- (destinations) side characteristics within such models, there have been few attempts to assess the implications of using alternative sources of network data. This study employs a sensitivity analysis approach to assess accessibility to GP surgeries in south Wales using proprietary and open sources of network data. Results suggest that there are significant differences between access scores derived from the use of networks which purport to portray the same features. Furthermore, the pattern of differences varies between urban and rural areas. Case studies are used to show that the actual representation of network-based features, often overlooked in previous research, can have important implications for the findings from such studies. We conclude by suggesting that the use of sensitivity analysis to assess geospatial data usability has a wider relevance for studies that involve the use of a range of GIS-based techniques in different application areas.}

For this study we employed an exploratory evaluation of user interaction in the context of web-based group decision support systems. Specifically, we used information-rich server logs captured through a web-based platform for participatory transportation planning to identify groups of users with similar use patterns. The groups were derived through multiple sequence alignment and hierarchical cluster analysis based on varying user activity measures. Subsequently, we assessed the reliability of the classifications obtained from the two clustering methods. Our results indicate limited reliability of classifications of activity sequences through multiple sequence alignment analysis and robust groupings from hierarchical cluster analysis for user activity initiations and durations. The presented work contributes a novel methodological framework for the evaluation of complex software systems that extends beyond the common approach of soliciting user satisfaction.}

abstract = {Accurate delineation of global built-up area (BUA) is fundamental to a better understanding of human development and the impacts on global environmental change. Existing global datasets of human settlement were mostly generated at medium and coarse spatial resolutions, including BUA and other impervious surfaces. With multiple high-resolution satellite constellations now available (e.g., ZiYuan-3 (ZY3), SPOT-5/6/7, Cartosat-1/2, and WorldView-2/3), identifying the global BUA explicitly from the complex landscapes becomes possible. In this study, a novel method was proposed for automated extraction of BUA at the global scale, by fusing a series of building features. Specifically, two planar features, the Morphological Building Index (MBI) and Harris corner detector, were employed to characterize the structure and corner attributes of buildings. Moreover, two multi-angular built-up indices (MABIs), i.e., Ratio Multi-angular Built-up Index (RMABI) and Normalized Difference Multi-angular Built-up Index (NDMABI), were proposed to represent the vertical properties of buildings based on multi-view images, which can further complement the planar features. 45 global cities were selected to validate the performance of the proposed method with images acquired by the ZY3 satellite constellation. The results show that the fusion of MBI and Harris corner can achieve satisfactory accuracy, i.e., 91.12%, 88.85%, 82.82% and 0.85, for the average overall accuracy (OA), user's accuracy (UA), producer's accuracy (PA), and F1-score, respectively, for all the test cities. After fusing the MABIs with the planar features, the average OA, UA, PA and F values of the final results were 92.00%, 86.20%, 89.14% and 0.87 for the RMABI, and 91.83%, 85.51%, 89.62% and 0.87 for the NDMABI, respectively. In particular, addition of the MABIs can further reduce the omission errors where medium/high rise buildings with low local contrast exist. We compared our results with two existing state-of-the-art global BUA products, Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) and Global Urban Footprint (GUF), which further corroborated the effectiveness of our method.}

Using geographic big data that cover the entire country, this paper analyzes the urban development level (UDL) of newly added outlying patches within 275 cities at the prefecture level or above in China from 2005 to 2015. The results revealed the following. 1) High-value cities are primarily located in the east, whereas low-value cities are primarily located in the west. The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration (BTHUA) is a major area with low UDLs, whereas the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration (YRDUA) and the Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration (PRDUA) are major areas with high UDLs. 2) The results of a multivariate regression demonstrate that GDP per capita (GDPPC), average elevation (AE), the distance between the new outlying urban patches, the proportion of secondary industry in GDP (PSI), the average land price in the city (ALP), the original urban land areas (DIS), and economic balance (GDPSD) significantly affect the UDL values of these cities. Relatively higher GDPPC and ALP are associated with a significant increase in the UDL, while more AE, DIS, GDPSD and PSI will decrease the UDL. The results of this paper provide a reference to understand the conditions of outlying developmental zones in China over the past 10 years as well as to explore healthy and reasonable urban spatial expansion forms.}

To cope with the planning challenges this will bring, developing a retrospective understanding of urban land-use dynamics and the underlying driving-forces behind urban growth is a key prerequisite. This research uses regression-based land-use change models – and in particular non-spatial logistic regression models (LR) and auto-logistic regression models (ALR) – for the Mumbai region over the period 1973–2010, in order to determine the drivers behind spatiotemporal urban expansion. Both global models are complemented by a local, spatial model, the so-called geographically weighted logistic regression (GWLR) model, one that explicitly permits variations in driving-forces across space. The study comes to two main conclusions. First, both global models suggest similar driving-forces behind urban growth over time, revealing that LRs and ALRs result in estimated coefficients with comparable magnitudes. Second, all the local coefficients show distinctive temporal and spatial variations. It is therefore concluded that GWLR aids our understanding of urban growth processes, and so can assist context-related planning and policymaking activities when seeking to secure a sustainable urban future.}

Without easy access to fine-scale data, researchers have to rely heavily on statistical and aggregated indicators available in officially released yearbooks, to understand Chinese city system. Not to mention the data quality of yearbooks, it is problematic that a large number of towns or downtown areas of counties are not addressed in yearbooks. To address this issue, as a following study of Long et al. (2016), we have redefined the Chinese city system, using percolation theory in the light of newly emerging big/open data. In this paper, we propose our alternative definition of a city with road/street junctions, and present the methodology for extracting city system for the whole country with national wide road junctions. A city is defined as “a spatial cluster with a minimum of 100 road/street junctions within a 300 m distance threshold”. Totally we identify 4629 redefined cities with a total urban area of 64,144 km2 for the whole China. We observe total city number increases from 2273 in 2009 to 4629 in 2014. We find that expanded urban area during 2009 and 2014, comparing with urban areas in 2009 are associated with 73.3% road junction density, 25.3% POI density and 5.5% online comment density. In addition, we benchmark our results with the conventional Chinese city system by using yearbooks.}

abstract = {Spatial or GIS-based Multicriteria Decision Analysis (GIS-MCDA) incorporates a mixed set of theories, methods and tools in order to combine geospatial data with decision makers' judgments for the purpose of generating information required in spatial decision making. However, given the complex nature of spatial decision making processes, contradicting preferences of experts regarding the proper evaluation criteria to be used as well as uncertainty of inputs, the GIS-MCDA results may not be perfectly matched with the community preferences. Consequently, ensuring that the outcomes of decision-making processes are indeed consistent with the needs, values and preferences of the public is of critical importance. Accordingly, this study proceeds to employ Public Participation GIS (PPGIS) or citizen-generated information as reference data to validate the results of GIS-MCDA processes. This validation is carried out by means of certain spatial indices including total coverage, geometric intersection, central distances and statistical indices. To this end, the issue of selecting the optimal sites for the establishment of restaurants in Babolsar, Mazandaran province, was selected as the case study. The study proceeded by initially determining the optimal locations of restaurants based on expert opinion and via the GIS-based Best-Worst multicriteria method. Next, a Web-based PPGIS tool was designed and implemented, enabling citizens to draw the optimal sites for restaurant establishment. Finally, the optimal locations determined via the multicriteria method (in three suitable, moderate and unsuitable classes) were compared and validated with PPGIS in accordance with the corresponding spatial indices. Although the suitable class of the GIS-MCDA output map (expert-derived restaurant sites), indicating preferences of experts, had the highest level of complete coverage (0.1%) and intersection (2.6%) with PPGIS (citizen-derived restaurant sites) as opposed to the other two classes, the validation results indicate a rather low level of consistency between experts’ solution and citizen opinions in the designation of proper sites for the establishment of restaurants.}

This is done by reviewing the literature in order to acquire important evidence to support the inductive process of theory building, and to highlight the upcoming trends in participatory research and policy-making that exploit ICT and Web 2.0 social software. Our analysis indicates that a transformative relationship between data and people creates new forms of distant search for solutions and decision making. We argue that interest in crowdsourcing has expanded from computing researches to social and environmental applications. This new practical dimension unlocks the futures of integration of crowdsourcing into best practices in the governance of sustainability in an urban context. Building on evidence that implementing crowdsourcing into the forthcoming governance of urban sustainability is increasingly recognised as a common priority, the paper suggests policy makers to devote more resources to ensure openness, transparency, interoperability and adaptability of crowdsourcing platforms.}

This leaves a challenge for characterisation, modelling, forecasting and management activities. Here we demonstrate the value of community-based (‘citizen science’) observations for modelling and understanding catchment response as a contribution to catchment science. The scheme implemented within the 42km2 Haltwhistle Burn catchment, a tributary of the River Tyne in northeast England, has harvested and used quantitative and qualitative observations from the public in a novel way to effectively capture spatial and temporal river response. Community-based rainfall, river level and flood observations have been successfully collected and quality-checked, and used to build and run a physically-based, spatially-distributed catchment model, SHETRAN. Model performance using different combinations of observations is tested against traditionally-derived hydrographs. Our results show how the local network of community-based observations alongside traditional sources of hydro-information supports characterisation of catchment response more accurately than using traditional observations alone over both spatial and temporal scales. We demonstrate that these community-derived datasets are most valuable during local flash flood events, particularly towards peak discharge. This information is often missed or poorly represented by ground-based gauges, or significantly underestimated by rainfall radar, as this study clearly demonstrates. While community-based observations are less valuable during prolonged and widespread floods, or over longer hydrological periods of interest, they can still ground-truth existing traditional sources of catchment data to increase confidence during characterisation and management activities. Involvement of the public in data collection activities also encourages wider community engagement, and provides important information for catchment management.}

These attitudes are posited to be influenced by geographic (spatial) discounting wherein the distance from domicile may contribute to local opposition or support. In contrast to specific development projects, the potential influence of NIMBY/YIMBY in a general land use planning process has not been systematically evaluated. In this study, we analyzed empirical data from a public participation GIS (PPGIS) process implemented for a general plan revision to examine the evidence for geographic discounting for a range of land uses using mapped preferences by community residents. Using distance analysis, we found significant evidence for geographic discounting by land use type with variable discount rates influenced by location of residence and the spatial configuration of land use in the planning area represented by zoning. The findings were consistent with NIMBY/YIMBY expectations with the exception of residential development where the results were more ambiguous. Residents want future land uses with amenities (open space, recreation, and trails) closer to domicile and more intensive, developed land uses (commercial, tourism, events, parking) further away. The findings have potentially broad implications because general/comprehensive planning—a requirement of most local governments in the U.S.—is operationalized through land use zones that appear subject to spatial discounting and the manifestation of potential NIMBY/YIMBY effects in the planning process. Future research should examine other planning contexts such as large urban areas with a greater diversity of land uses.}

Combined with the presence of pervasive coastal threats, such as flooding and erosion, this is having widespread impacts on coastal populations, infrastructure and ecosystems. For the right adaptive strategies to be adopted, and planning decisions to be made, rigorous evaluation of the available options is required. This evaluation hinges on the availability and use of suitable datasets. For knowledge to be derived from coastal datasets, such data needs to be combined and analysed in an effective manner. This paper reviews a wide range of literature relating to data-driven approaches to coastal risk evaluation, revealing how limitations have been imposed on many of these methods, due to restrictions in computing power and access to data. The rapidly emerging field of ‘Big Data’ can help overcome many of these hurdles. ‘Big Data’ involves powerful computer infrastructures, enabling storage, processing and real-time analysis of large volumes and varieties of data, in a fast and reliable manner. Through consideration of examples of how ‘Big Data’ technologies are being applied to fields related to coastal risk, it becomes apparent that geospatial Big Data solutions hold clear potential to improve the process of risk based decision making on the coast. ‘Big Data’ does not provide a stand-alone solution to the issues and gaps outlined in this paper, yet these technological methods hold the potential to optimise data-driven approaches, enabling robust risk profiles to be generated for coastal regions.}

The roles and the relationships among the actors may vary according to the underlying planning paradigm or style which the local normative and socio-cultural factors shape in the actual practices. Methods and tools to be used in the process phases may vary accordingly. A Geodesign study is characterised by the integrated usage of Geographic Information Science methods and tools to transform spatial data into relevant knowledge for informed design and decision-making. Thus, central to Geodesign are such issues as how to design and manage such complex processes, and how to orchestrate digital methods and tools in Geodesign support systems architectures. To address these challenges, the concept of metaplanning is proposed as an aid to the design of Geodesign processes. Expected benefits of the metaplanning exercise include better process understanding by the participants, improvements in management, and enhanced process transparency and accountability. Moreover, metaplanning may drive the integration of digital information technologies to support the Geodesign workflows. After the formalization of the concept, a Business Process Management (BPM) approach to metaplanning is proposed for its operationalization, aiming at both improving the Geodesign process and easing the creation of process-oriented 2nd generation Planning Support Systems. After a critical discussion on the possible advantages of the metaplanning approach to the design of process-oriented Geodesign workflows and support systems, issues setting the future research agenda in this domain are outlined.}

Social data measuring the importance of the landscape was collected using public participation geographic information systems (PPGIS) while ecologically valuable areas were identified from species distributions and Zonation conservation prioritization software. We applied multiple importance thresholds (cut-offs) to separately identify and measure social and ecological hotspots, and then quantified the degree of spatial concurrence (overlap) when combining the layers to generate social-ecological hotspots. Based on the findings, we developed guidelines for identifying social-ecological hotspots under variable data conditions. We describe the practical implications of our findings by showing how the selected method for SES hotspot identification can enhance or limit the utility of hotspot analysis for decision support in regional conservation planning.}

abstract = {After a natural disaster roads can be damaged or blocked by debris, while bridges and viaducts may collapse. This commonly observed hazard causes some road sections to be closed and may even disconnect the road network. In the immediate disaster response phase work teams are dispatched to open a subset of roads to reconnect the network. Closed roads are traversable only after they are unblocked/cleared by one of the teams. The main objective of this research is to provide an efficient solution method to generate a synchronized work schedule for the road clearing teams. The solution should specify the synchronized routes of each clearing team so that: 1) connectivity of the network is regained, and 2) none of the closed roads are traversed unless their unblocking/clearing procedure is finished. In this study we develop an exact Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) formulation to solve this problem. Furthermore, we propose a matheuristic that is based on an MIP-relaxation and a local search algorithm. We prove that the optimality gap of the relaxation solution is bounded by K times the lower bound obtained from the relaxed model, where K is the number of teams. We show computationally that the matheuristic obtains optimal or near-optimal solutions.}

These consequences include storm surge, flooding, and erosion from more frequent severe coastal storms, and rising seas. This chapter describes an international Canadian–Caribbean coastal community-based research initiative designed to raise awareness among, and to communicate to, community members, the evidence of local impacts of climate change and to examine adaptation strategies to address these impacts. Selected Canadian and Caribbean coastal communities are first characterized by their physical environment and their economic, social, and cultural assets as well as the predicted vulnerabilities and threats. Community priorities are captured to develop and then evaluate alternatives for adaptive strategies. These alternatives, applied in specific local contexts, include the suite of adaptive strategies to (1) protect the community from the expected impacts of coastal environmental change, (2) accommodate the impacts through managed resilience, (3) retreat from the coastal zone in order to reduce inhabitants' vulnerabilities, and (4) do nothing—the most common strategy in practice—in preparation for the expected impacts. Top-down and bottom-up collaborative efforts of the communities of practice within the coastal zone are required to manage adaptation in the coastal zone. Bottom-up enhancement is delivered through the direct engagement of community education beginning with the local school children. Top-down enhancement seeks community participation for the establishment of new municipal governance and strategic integrated policy toward improved coastal sustainably under the threats of the changing climate.}

Therefore, appropriate mapping algorithms that allow quick and accurate visualization of the scenic beauty in a spatially-explicit manner are of significant importance. The present study implements and compares three mapping approaches including Multi-Criteria Evaluation (MCE), Logistic Regression (LR) and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network in a GIS environment for landscape aesthetic suitability mapping in the Ziarat watershed basin of northeastern Iran. Ground truth data were collected during several field observations and landscape photographs were taken in winter and autumn. Mapping algorithms were compared for their spatial accuracy using the Receiving Operator Characteristic (ROC) method and the comparison was made for automatic identification of scenic beauty on routes applying landscape metrics. According to the results, the ROC statistic scored at 0.94, 0.93 and 0.88 for MLP, LR and MCE methods, respectively. In addition, landscape metrics-derived results depicted the MLP method as more successful for automated delineation of a connected network of scenic routes. Finally, due to acceptable spatial accuracy, this study suggests expert-based mapping methods such as MCE and statistical algorithms such as LR can be used as ground truth layers for a sampling of presence/absence data. The map containing sampled points can be used as a training layer for iterative artificial intelligence-based methods such as MLP for quick and accurate suitability mapping of landscape aesthetics in neighboring watersheds. This application demonstrates how landscape aesthetics as one of cultural ecosystem services can be integrated into land-use planning practices.}

This question fits into broader discussions on how knowledge construction, circulation and utilization can improve competences in local government (efficiency and effectiveness), make urban planning more knowledge-based, and provide greater recognition of citizens' knowledge (accountability). Local governments need such instruments in dealing with increasing complexity and uncertainty in urban development. We examine how uneven patterns of technological change in using ICT and GIS are transforming current local government work processes in terms of efficiency and effectiveness in their outcomes, utilizing empirical data from extended case studies in six medium-sized cities in India, South Africa, Brazil, and Peru, participating in the Chance2Sustain research network. Knowledge management in cities is configured through several dimensions: 1) discourses for digitizing KM in local urban development; 2) actor networks producing socio-spatial knowledge; 3) embedding KM in decision-making processes (power struggles, exclusion); and 4) influences of KM on work practices and interfaces with citizens. The case study results show that 1) KM discourses concerned four issues: strategic urban planning and integrated land use planning; determining geographic boundaries in urban development discourses; streamlining work processes of local governments, and mapping poverty and needs assessments; 2) initiatives mainly link government with the private sector at various scale levels; 3) codified and technical knowledge remains dominant in discussions on urban development; and 4) effects of KM are uneven, but improve work process efficiency, although the interface with citizens remains limited, focusing on middle-class relations to the exclusion of the poor.}

Consequently, information systems are required to deal with large datasets containing raw data to build high level abstractions. Semantic Web technologies offer powerful representation tools for pervasive applications. The convergence of location-based services and Semantic Web standards allows an easier interlinking and annotation of trajectories. However, due to the wide range of requirements on modeling mobile object trajectories, it is important to define a high-level data model for representing trajectory episodes and contextual elements with multiple levels of granularity and different options to represent spatial and temporal extents, as well as to express quantitative and qualitative semantic descriptions. In this article, we focus on modeling mobile object trajectories in the context of Semantic Web. First, we introduce a new version of the Semantic Trajectory Episodes (STEP) ontology to represent generic spatiotemporal episodes. Then, we present FrameSTEP as a new framework for annotating semantic trajectories based on episodes. As a result, we combine our ontology, which can represent spatiotemporal phenomena at different levels of granularity, with annotation algorithms, which allow to create instances of our model. The proposed spatial annotation algorithm explores the Linked Open Data cloud and OpenStreetMap tags to find relevant types of spatial features in order to describe the environment where the trajectory took place. Our framework can guide the development of future expert systems in trajectory analysis. It enables reasoning about knowledge gathered from large trajectory data and linked datasets in order to create several intelligent services.}

(1) The ANP framework can manage the interdependences among criteria and zones, (2) the multiple assessment criteria can consider comprehensive perspectives of bikeability, and (3) the grey numbers measure possible ranges of criteria performances and are good at handling various performances within a zone.

These contributions fall in the area of human-centric sensing, area specialized in using what people spontaneously say on social media to detect the occurrence of given events. Research in this area has exhibited interesting results, regardless of the accuracy of sensing operations. In fact, in some cases it is possible to corroborate the information extracted from OSN posts with the ground truth obtained from specialized hardware sensors. In others, the information extracted from OSNs does not reveal true environmental conditions. Nevertheless, OSNs may help shed light on the sensitivity of human beings to a wide variety of environmental phenomena. We here review the work that has been published to this date. In particular, we provide a survey that may benefit both environmental and computer scientists, as this work aims to show where we stand in the understanding of the complex relationship between human beings and the natural environment, when this is mediated by OSNs.}

This study reviews the emerging data sources and their current use, focusing on non-motorized travel monitoring. In this study, the emerging data are categorized into mode-unspecified and mode-specified data based on whether the mode used can be detected with no or little effort. While mode-unspecified data are collected without sorting out non-motorized travelers, mode-specified data at least know who (which mode) is being monitored. So far, commercial vendors provide a vast volume of mode-unspecified data, but their products have been mainly used for motorized trips or are in initial stages of development. Meanwhile, readily available data sources and their applications are more concentrated on mode-specified data, which have enabled varying non-motorized travel studies—including travel pattern identification, route-choice modeling, crash/air pollution exposure estimation, and new facility provision evaluation—but are mostly focused on bicycling. Despite the potential of emerging data, their use also has several challenges, such as limited mode inference, sample bias, and lack of detailed trip/traveler information due to privacy issues. More efforts are needed, such as improving data accuracy and developing robust data fusion techniques, to be able to fully utilize the emerging data sources.}

We have developed a method for generating a privacy-preserving heat map with user diversity (ppDIV), in which the density of trajectories, as well as the diversity of users, is taken into account, thus preventing the bias effects caused by participation inequality. The method is applied to public cycling workouts and compared with privacy-preserving kernel density estimation (ppKDE) focusing only on the density of the recorded trajectories and privacy-preserving user count calculation (ppUCC), which is similar to the quadrat-count of individual application users. An awareness of privacy was introduced to all methods as a data pre-processing step following the principle of k-Anonymity. Calibration results for our heat maps using bicycle counting data gathered by the city of Helsinki are good (R2>0.7) and raise high expectations for utilizing heat maps in a city planning context. This is further supported by the diurnal distribution of the workouts indicating that, in addition to sports-oriented cyclists, many utilitarian cyclists are tracking their commutes. However, sports tracking data can only enrich official in-situ counts with its high spatio-temporal resolution and coverage, not replace them.}

Any such delineation must eventually be cast onto administrative boundaries, an essential requirement for real-world applications. In the effort of relating administrative and alternative boundaries, we investigated in Italy the validity of general scaling laws, such as the area-population relation, and proposed a practical application. Relying on open data for population, settlements and road networks, we showed the extent to which scaling relations hold for different boundaries for urban areas, and how they compare to each other. We considered, beside Italian municipalities, urban areas based on the idea of “natural cities”, obtained using head/tail breaks of areas related to human mobility as an explicit indicator of existence of a city. Area-population data for administrative boundaries can be reconciled with scaling relations valid for both the world’s cities data and with those obtained from natural cities, provided an effective area is adopted in place of polygon planimetric area of municipalities. We eventually proposed an aggregation of administrative units using the empirical scaling relation as an objective function for accepting or rejecting pairwise fusion of boundaries. We suggest considering such a method, along with expert considerations, as an additional tool for real-world urban planning as seen from the very general perspective of seemingly abstract scaling laws.}

The constant drive to enable smart applications for them, especially inside public buildings, such as shopping malls, airports, museums, hospitals, etc., warrants a number of location-based services (LBSs) to be available indoors. Even though a plethora of indoor positioning systems have been explored over the years, there is still no de facto standard. For a public building, utilizing the existing communication infrastructure such as Wi-Fi or Bluetooth is more practical, scalable, and cost-effective compared to setting up a completely new infrastructure just for localization purpose. The main challenge of availing LBSs through such systems is the unavailability or inaccessibility of an up-to-date indoor map, especially for a public building. An innovative solution for this issue is to exploit the sensor data of Internet of Things (IoT) devices (e.g., smartphone) carried by the crowd who frequents these premises, and construct the indoor map by processing and fusing the sensor data. In this chapter, a number of existing crowdsourced outdoor/indoor map systems will be touched upon to explore the challenges faced. Considering the fact that the crowdsourced data acquired are from different sensors, and even coming from different persons’ devices, they may be noisy, uncertain, and incomplete. The challenges of processing these data and the subsequent adoption of algorithms to come up with a realistic indoor map are investigated. Finally, a comparative discussion based on the findings is provided by pointing out a few future research directions.}

This paper studies the requirements of LBS applications, through a survey conducted by the authors, identifies the current challenges of indoor LBS, and reviews the available solutions that address the most important challenge, that of providing seamless indoor/outdoor positioning. The paper also looks at the potential of emerging solutions and the technologies that may help to handle this challenge.}

abstract = {A significant barrier to the assessment of ecosystem services is a lack of primary data, especially for cultural ecosystem services. Spatial value transfer, also known as benefits transfer, is a method to identify the probable locations of ecosystem services based on empirical spatial associations found in other geographic locations. To date, there has been no systematic evaluation of spatial value transfer methods for cultural ecosystem services identified through participatory mapping methods. This research paper addresses this knowledge gap by examining key variables that influence value transfer for cultural ecosystem services: (1) the geographic setting, (2) the type of ecosystem services, and (3) the land cover data selected for value-transfer. Spatial data from public participation GIS (PPGIS) processes in two regions in Norway were used to evaluate spatial value transfer where the actual mapped distribution of cultural ecosystem values were compared to maps generated using value transfer coefficients. Six cultural ecosystem values were evaluated using two different land cover classification systems GlobCover (300m resolution) and CORINE (100m resolution). Value transfer maps based on the distribution of mapped ecosystem values produced strongly correlated results to primary data in both regions. Value transfer for cultural ecosystems appear valid under conditions where the primary data and value transfer regions have similar physical landscapes, the social and cultural values of the human populations are similar, and the primary data sample sizes are large and unbiased. We suggest the use of non-economic value transfer coefficients derived from participatory mapping as the current best approach for estimating the importance and spatial distribution of cultural ecosystem services.}

abstract = {Wind energy plays a key role in the transition to a low-carbon European energy system. The implementation of European and national targets for wind energy expansion is, however, challenged by technical, environmental, economic and social acceptance aspects. Further research on wind power expansion is compelled due to dynamic aspects such as land-use fluctuations, evolution of wind turbine technology, associated cost, and other factors. For that reason, a systematic approach for exploring future scenarios of onshore wind power development under techno-economic aspects and quantitative aspects of social acceptance (distributive justice and regulatory framework) was developed. The model was developed in Python, PostgreSQL and SQliteDB and encompasses a high-resolution GIS-based assessment of potential locations for wind turbines. Homogenous input data allows for analysing the wind power potential across Europe. Poland was chosen as a case study to examine the impact of the distance regulation introduced in 2016 and its subsequent amendments, which are relevant for onshore wind power development foreseen in the EU reference scenario 2016 for 2030. The findings show that Poland can reach the target of 10.3 GW set by the EU scenario at Levelized Cost of Electricity below €60/MWh. The transparent modelling framework and findings can support the decision making process on wind energy expansion, which is in the hands of policy makers, private investors and local citizens.}

This paper presents and describes a new polycategorical method that integrates positive aspects of both geographically weighted regression (GWR)-based and quantile regression (QR)-based interpolators for solving areal interpolation problems. Two different types of neighborhoods for selecting observations used to estimate ancillary control densities are presented: one that is spatially based and one that is statistically based. The new polycategorical methods are evaluated against a number of existing methods – areal weighting, pycnophylactic, binary dasymetric, intelligent dasymetric mapping, and GWR using test data from the 2010 census population, the National Land Cover Database 2006 (NLCD2006) and the Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Reference (TIGER) line graph files. The evaluations include several overall error measurement indices as well as maps of the spatial distribution of the error associated with selected methods. Results suggest that with appropriate land cover categories and neighborhoods, the new polycategorical methods provide comparable results to local regression models but with much less computation complexity.}

This work investigates the spatiotemporal properties required to trigger building contents evacuations in the floodplain during a flood event. The spatial properties for building risks are based on topography, flood inundation, building location, building elevation, and road access to determine five categories of vulnerability, vulnerable basement, flooded basement, vulnerable first-floor, flooded first-floor, and road access. Using this framework, a model designed to track the spatiotemporal patterns of building evacuations is presented. The model is based upon real-time flood forecast predictions that are linked with building properties to create a model that captures the spatiotemporal ordering of building vulnerabilities and building content evacuations. Applicable to different communities at risk from flooding, the evacuation model is applied to a historical flood for a university campus, demonstrating how the defined elements are used to derive a pattern of vulnerability and evacuation for a campus threatened by severe flooding.}

Although many approaches have been developed in the literature, efficiently modeling the network constraint that objects (e.g. urban facility) are observed on or alongside a street network remains a challenging task for spatial clustering. Based on the techniques of mathematical morphology, this paper presents a new spatial clustering approach NMMSC designed for mining the grouping patterns of network-constrained point objects. NMMSC is essentially a hierarchical clustering approach, and it generally consists of two main steps: first, the original vector data is converted to raster data by utilizing basic linear unit of network as the pixel in network space; second, based on the specified 1-dimensional raster structure, an extended mathematical morphology operator (i.e. dilation) is iteratively performed to identify spatial point agglomerations with hierarchical structure snapped on a network. Compared to existing methods of network-constrained hierarchical clustering, our method is more efficient for cluster similarity computation with linear time complexity. The effectiveness and efficiency of our approach are verified through the experiments with real and synthetic data sets.}

We organize our findings in relation to data collection and data handling, the process of developing smartphone applications, and the ways that outcomes are reported. While the literature is nascent and technological advances are continually opening new opportunities, it is notable that there is limited scholarship that explicitly connects the monitoring function of smartphones to tangible conservation action (e.g., only 10 percent of the papers analysed data collected by smartphones, let alone making connections to required actions or policy). We discuss two central implications in terms of research-implementation spaces for environmental monitoring with smartphones: (1) what we identify as the cost paradox, the lack of recognition of actual costs of app development, monitoring, and implementation; and (2) the need to center the role of people and partnerships in order to ask more precise questions about outcomes for app users and conservation impacts from data collection. We conclude with a call for more research on costs and actual impacts, documentation of factors that lead to successes and failures, and how digital divides influence conservation outcomes. Our intent is not to call into question the potential impacts of smartphone technologies, but to encourage further understanding of how and when they can be most useful.}

Geoprocessing patterns are used to describe commonly used sub-routines of the fusion process and therefore support the workflow composition. The implementation is based on open standards and comprises a Web-client, several geoprocessing services and a fusion engine to support the Web-based compilation and execution of spatial data fusion workflows in an ad hoc manner.}

It is literally relied upon or responsible for much of what we see and do on a daily basis, with many service systems designed and managed to perform as best as possible. This review paper highlights the increased application of optimization through geographic information systems (GIS) to support management and decision making. A broad perception in management science and optimization circles is that GIS is merely a database system facilitating access to data, mapping and summary analysis. However, optimization is actually available through basic functionality in many GIS packages. This review identifies many of the optimization capabilities available in GIS, and is significant because there is a steady and growing trend of publication in academic and other outlets reporting application efforts that rely on GIS-based optimization. GIS usage is facilitated by user-friendly point-and-click access. This no doubt explains increased management planning involving GIS, making this review important for many reasons. Availability of optimization tools and techniques in GIS translates into use, often by individuals that likely do not understand the underlying models and methods. The growing significance of contemporary GIS software as a management and business analytic medium makes this a timely and important review topic, and suggests that increased interest in the capabilities provided in GIS is essential in order to ensure that optimization methods are appropriately and meaningfully applied in practice.}

A highly relevant phenomenon is therefore the so-called citizen observatories whereby the observations of ordinary citizens, and not just those of professionals and scientists, are included in earth observation and environmental management. Advanced citizen observatories can enable a two-way communication paradigm between citizens and decision makers, potentially resulting in profound changes to local environmental management processes and, as such, in social innovation processes and outcomes. This paper analyses the social innovation potential of such ICT-enabled citizen observatories to increase eParticipation in local flood risk management. The findings from empirical research in two case study locations highlight the divergent roles that authorities conceive for citizens and the role(s) that citizens in practice assign to themselves. Moreover, given the institutional structures identified in these cases and the obligation of authorities to be accountable for their decisions, citizen observatories do not automatically imply that citizens will have a higher level of participation in flood risk management, nor that communication between stakeholders improves.}

Here we present a framework for estimating populations from the bottom up, entirely independently of national census data, a critical need in areas without recent and reliable census data. To make observations of population density, we replace national census data with a microcensus, in which we enumerate population for a sample of small areas within the states of Kano and Kaduna in northern Nigeria. Using supervised texture-based classifiers with very high resolution satellite imagery, we produce a binary map of human settlement at 8-meter resolution across the two states and then a more refined classification consisting of 7 residential types and 1 non-residential type. Using the residential types and a model linking them to the population density observations, we produce population estimates across the two states in a gridded raster format, at approximately 90-meter resolution. We also demonstrate a simulation framework for capturing uncertainty and presenting estimates as prediction intervals for any region of interest of any size and composition within the study region. Used in concert with previously published demographic estimates, our population estimates allowed for predictions of the population under 5 in ten administrative wards that fit strongly with reference data collected during polio vaccination campaigns.}

With a handful of such datasets, their performances and skill in flood exposure assessment have not been explored. This study proposes a comprehensive framework to understand the dynamics and differences in population flood exposure over Canada by employing four global population datasets alongside the census data from Statistics Canada as the reference. The flood exposure is quantified based on a set of floodplain maps (for 2015, 1 in 100-yr and 1 in 200-yr event) for Canada derived from the CaMa-Flood global flood model. To obtain further insights at the regional level, the methodology is implemented over six flood-prone River Basins in Canada. We find that about 9% (3.31 million) and 11% (3.90 million) of the Canadian population resides within 1 in 100-yr and 1 in 200-yr floodplains. We notice an excellent performance of WorldPop, and LandScan in most of the cases, which is unaffected by the representation of flood hazard, while Global Human Settlement and Gridded Population of the World showed large deviations. At last, we determined the long-term dynamics of population flood exposure and vulnerability from 2006 to 2019. Through this analysis, we also identify the regions that contain a significantly larger population exposed to floods. The relevant conclusions derived from the study highlight the need for careful selection of population datasets for preventing further amplification of uncertainties in flood risk. We recommend a detailed assessment of the severely exposed regions by including precise ground-level information. The results derived from this study may be useful not only for flood risk management but also contribute to understanding other disaster impacts on human-environment interrelationships.}

The emerging and challenging areas – geospatial ICT, green infrastructure planning, novel design using collaborative responses, climate planning, limiting urban sprawl and short-circuit economic approaches – are explored as viable facets for devising and sustaining urban transition strategies.

abstract = {Spring frost is one of the major weather-related threats to winter wheat. The damage to winter wheat caused by spring frost is aggravated by the increase in extreme weather events and the advance of spring phenology driven by a warming climate. Until recently, studies of frost damage were primarily based on controlled field experiments and crop model simulations, which cannot accurately represent the real frost damage suffered by winter wheat in the natural environment. In this study, a remote sensing-based spring frost damage index (SFDI) was proposed to rapidly and effectively quantify the impact of spring frost on winter wheat at the provincial scale. Compared with the existing methods, the SFDI is easy to implement with widely available remotely sensed vegetation index (VI) time-series data. It can be used to assess spring frost damage to winter wheat in near real-time to allow a rapid response. Although the SFDI was developed for winter wheat and spring frost, it has the potential to be extended to other agricultural hazards and crop types through careful adjustments to the design. We assessed the performance of SFDI using a spring frost event that occurred from April 3–7, 2018, in North China as a case study. The results showed that the severely damaged areas were mainly located at the junction of Hebei, Henan, and Shandong provinces, especially in western Shandong Province. The result showed good agreement with the proxy data retrieved from the national archives of regional newspaper reports about the event. The validity of the new index (SFDI) was also verified against the reduction in county-level crop production. Additionally, we used multivariate linear regression (MLR) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) to identify the key factors affecting the spatial variation in SFDI. The results indicated that the growth status of winter wheat before spring frost and the amount of precipitation during the frost event were the two major factors affecting the severity of frost damage to winter wheat, followed by the accumulated frost degree-days and soil moisture. This suggests that proper management of the crop growth rate after winter wheat greening and adequate soil moisture (from irrigation and precipitation) before and during the spring frost period could greatly alleviate the damage of spring frost to winter wheat.}

Access to and visual representation of environmental information for the public is essential for attracting greater awareness of water quality and quantity matters. Detailed interdisciplinary knowledge about the environment is required to ensure that the environmental policy-making community of New Zealand considers regional and local differences of hydrological statuses, while assessing the overall national situation.

Secondly, we contrast international state of the art data management developments with the present status for groundwater information in New Zealand. Finally, for the topics (i) data access and harmonisation, (ii) sensor web enablement and (iii) metadata, we summarise our findings, provide recommendations on future developments and highlight the specific advantages resulting from a seamless view, discovery, access, and analysis of interoperable hydrological information and metadata for decision making.}

Integrated geographic modelling and simulation is a computational means to improve understanding of the environment. With the development of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and web technologies, it is possible to conduct open, extensible integrated geographic modelling across a network in which resources can be accessed and integrated, and further distributed geographic simulations can be performed. This open web-distributed modelling and simulation approach is likely to enhance the use of existing resources and can attract diverse participants. With this approach, participants from different physical locations or domains of expertise can perform comprehensive modelling and simulation tasks collaboratively. This paper reviews past integrated modelling and simulation systems, highlighting the associated development challenges when moving to an open web-distributed system. A conceptual framework is proposed to introduce a roadmap from a system design perspective, with potential use cases provided. The four components of this conceptual framework - a set of standards, a resource sharing environment, a collaborative integrated modelling environment, and a distributed simulation environment - are also discussed in detail with the goal of advancing this emerging field.}

It is important to understand Alaskans' perceptions and opinions about energy consumption to solve Alaska's domestic energy problems and creating a sustainable future. However, it is challenging to collect public opinions about energy consumption using conventional survey methods, which are often expensive, labor-intensive, and slow. This study utilizes information-rich Twitter data to investigate Alaskans' perceptions and opinions on various energy sources and in particular clean energy sources. Using the geotagged Twitter data collected in Alaska from 2014 to 2016, a lexicon-based sentiment analysis approach was first applied to analyze the polarity in the expressed opinions. Further, a novel fuzzy-based theory is employed to derive the sentiment of the opinion in each tweet. The results indicate that there is a valuable growth rate for a set of energy-related keywords, such as “sun”, “power”, and “nuclear”. The rank of top 20 renewable energy-related keywords shows the word “Tidal” has the highest ranking followed by “solar panel”. Moreover, the attention to various types of energy is increasing dramatically among Alaskans. Importantly, Alaskans' attitudes toward energy and renewable energy changed positively from 2014 to 2016, indicating that Alaskans' energy choices are more acceptive towards or even favor renewable energy in the future.}

These attractions scatter in city spaces following some specific forms: clustered in some regions and dispersed in others. It is known that users organize their tours in a city not only according to the distance between different attractions but also according to other factors such as time constraints, expenses, interests, and the similarities between different attractions. Hence, users' travel tours can help us gain a better understanding about the relationships among different attractions at the city scale. In this paper, a methodological framework is developed to detect tourists' spatial-temporal behaviors from social media data, and then such information is used to extract and analyze city's tourism districts. We believe that this city space division will make significant contributions to the fields of urban planning, tourism facility providing, and scenery area constructing. A typical tourism city in China—Huangshan—is selected as our study area for experiments.}

However, measuring the use of green space has been problematic. Because, most previously used data on measuring green space use are self-reported or collected via social surveys, which not only include limited samples, but also are always subjective, costly, and laborious. This study integrates sensor and positioning technologies and measures the use of green space from an emerging big data perspective. The hourly real-time Tencent user density (RTUD) data from social media are used to analyze the time-spatial distribution of urban park users. RTUD data, park attributes, and surrounding landscape features are incorporated into ArcGIS for spatial analysis. A group of linear regression models is constructed to determine factors that may be associated with the user density of urban parks. The total accumulated number of observed users is 3.25 million in 686 urban parks of Shenzhen in two typical sunny days – a work day and a rest day. Without costly and laborious field investigation, based on RTUD data, we conduct a city wide analysis regarding all parks. The proposed method is proved to be suitable for measuring urban green space use at city-level or even large scale. Results show that park user density is relatively high in well-developed areas and community parks. Park attributes and surrounding landscape features are significantly associated to park use. The findings of this study can help policy makers optimize the construction and maintenance of urban parks.}

Community-based monitoring and information systems or ‘citizen observatories’ are a form of SEIS whereby citizens are involved in new roles such as data collection for environmental monitoring, data and knowledge sharing for joint decision- making, and cooperative planning. Despite the technological advances and the notional potential, many efforts to implement community-based monitoring systems (CBM) are facing difficulties with engaging the core stakeholder. The success of CBMs relies on the active participation and commitment of all involved stakeholders: citizen, decision and policy makers, and (private) data aggregators and scientists. This requires in-depth understanding of their motivations, incentives and barriers for participating. This paper draws on the Theory of Planned Behaviour as an organising theoretical framework and reviews the (dispersed) empirical insights from the literature in order to generate an integrated overview of the incentives and barriers of the aforementioned stakeholders to participate in CBMs. The insights from the literature allow us to take stock of the state of research into motivations for CBM participation, to identify complementary and conflicting incentives for the respective actors, and to indicate gaps to be addressed in future research.}

This article conceptually proposes an idea of sensing cities from a street perspective, emphasizes the significance of street units in quantitative urban studies. Using a three-month taxi trajectory dataset and the major streets in Beijing, we explore the spatio-temporal patterns of urban mobility on streets, cluster streets into nine types based on their dynamic functions and capacities. Additionally, we discuss the differences and connections between the linear street unit and traditional areal units, investigate the possibility of uncovering urban communities using streets, and point out the complexity of streets. We conclude that street unit as a supplement to areal units, is able to effectively minify the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP), sense urban dynamics, depict urban functions, and understand urban structures.}

Airborne data acquisition using helicopter and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) helps obtain a bird’s-eye view of disaster-affected areas. However, a major challenge to this approach is robustly processing a large amount of data to identify and map objects of interest on the ground in real-time. The current process is resource-intensive (must be carried out manually) and requires offline computing (through post-processing of aerial videos). This research introduces and evaluates a series of convolutional neural network (CNN) models for ground object detection from aerial views of disaster’s aftermath. These models are capable of recognizing critical ground assets including building roofs (both damaged and undamaged), vehicles, vegetation, debris, and flooded areas. The CNN models are trained on an in-house aerial video dataset (named Volan2018) that is created using web mining techniques. Volan2018 contains eight annotated aerial videos (65,580 frames) collected by drone or helicopter from eight different locations in various hurricanes that struck the United States in 2017–2018. Eight CNN models based on You-Only-Look-Once (YOLO) algorithm are trained by transfer learning, i.e., pre-trained on the COCO/VOC dataset and re-trained on Volan2018 dataset, and achieve 80.69% mAP for high altitude (helicopter footage) and 74.48% for low altitude (drone footage), respectively. This paper also presents a thorough investigation of the effect of camera altitude, data balance, and pre-trained weights on model performance, and finds that models trained and tested on videos taken from similar altitude outperform those trained and tested on videos taken from different altitudes. Moreover, the CNN model pre-trained on the VOC dataset and re-trained on balanced drone video yields the best result in significantly shorter training time.}

This method is based on participatory mapping and qualitative interpretation of positive landscape values (stemming from cultural ecosystem services), negative landscape values (derived from landscape factors that negatively influence social perception), and improvement preferences. It is developed and tested using data collected from 53 interviews with local community members from a highly urbanised stream corridor in the Metropolitan Region of Barcelona (Spain). Intensity score maps of positive/negative landscape values are combined according to their significant spatial co-existence. Conflict index maps are computed for each co-existing pair of positive/negative values, delimiting the areas with the highest index values. Qualitative analysis of the improvement preferences identified within these areas contributed to an understanding of the reasons behind these conflicts. Finally, a weighted linear combination of the positive/negative landscape value intensity maps is applied to identify the areas with the highest level of conflict. Therefore, this approach not only produces a spatial delimitation and prioritization of landscape conflict based on context specific landscape values, but it also characterizes the underlying drivers of conflict on the basis of the qualitative understanding of improvement preferences.}

Such physical workouts are required by a plan, which should be designed and supervised by sport specialists and medical assistants. Thus, the exercise sessions shall start with consultation of a coach, doctor and dietician; however, many times this scenario is not presented. In typical activities such as running, cycling and fitness, people use health mobile apps with their smartphones, which offer support for these activities. Nevertheless, the functionality and operation of these applications are isolated, because many and long questionnaires are performed. Additionally, the physical and health state of a user is not considered. These issues would be taken into account for determining recommendations about the time for doing exercise and the kind of activity for each person. In this work, a social semantic mobile framework to generate recommendations where a mobile application allows sensing the physical performance, taking into consideration medical criteria with smartphones is proposed. The approach includes a semantic cross-information that comes from social network and official data as well as sport activities and medical knowledge. This knowledge is translated into application ontologies related directly to health, nutrition and training domains. The methodology also covers physical fitness tests and a monitoring tool for evaluating the nutrition plan and the correct execution of the training. As case study, the mobile application offers to evaluate the physical and health conditions of a runner, automatically generate a nutrition plan and training, monitor plans and recomputed them if users make changes in their routines. The data provided from the social network are used as feedback in the application, in order to make the training and nutrition plans more flexible by applying spatio-temporal analysis based on machine learning. Finally, the generated training and nutrition plans were validated by specialists, they have demonstrated 82% of effectiveness rate in exercise training routines and 86% in nutrition plans. In addition, the results were compared with isolated approaches and manual recommendations made by specialists, the obtained overall performance was 81%.}

The delineation of zones and related land use ordinances are traditional components of an expert-driven, local government process that produces a general or comprehensive land use plan as required by law. Public participation in the development of general land use plans has rarely used participatory mapping methods that engage the general public to explicitly inform zoning decisions. In this study, we demonstrate how participatory mapping methods can assess the consistency, compatibility, and potential conflict of zoning with public values and preferences in a general plan revision process using a coastal community in California as a case study. We describe the participatory mapping design, data collection, and data analyses in a workflow to illustrate the methods, and present the strengths and limitations of the approach for use in a general land use planning process. Future research should expand these methods to assess the potential effects of resident domicile and “NIMBYism” on the results, and importantly, assess the impact of public participatory mapping in land use decisions if actually implemented by local government authorities.}

Unfortunately, polling units are frequently redrawn, provoking breaks in their data series. Previous electoral results play a key role in many analyses. They are used by political party workers and journalists to present quick assessments of outcomes, by political scientists and electoral geographers to perform detailed scrutinizes and by pollsters and forecasters to anticipate electoral results. In this paper, we study to what extent more complex geographical approaches (based on a proper location of electors on the territory using dasymetric techniques) are of value in comparison to simple methods (like areal weighting) for the problem of reallocating votes in a large, dense city. Barcelona is such a city and, having recently redrawn the boundaries of its census sections, it is an ideal candidate for further scrutiny. Although previous studies show the approaches based on dasymetric techniques outperforming simpler solutions for interpolating census figures, our results show that improvements in the process of reallocating votes are marginal. This brings into question the extra effort that entails introducing ancillary sources of information in a dense urban area for this kind of data. Additional research is required to know whether and when these results are extendable.}

abstract = {Identifying the activities that individuals conduct in a city is key to understanding urban dynamics. It is difficult, however, to identify different human activities on a large scale without incurring significant costs. This study focuses on modeling the spatiotemporal patterns of different activity types within cities by employing user-contributed, geosocial content as a proxy for human activities. In this work, we use linguistic topic modeling to analyze georeferenced twitter data in order to differentiate different activity types. We then examine the spatial and temporal patterns of the derived activity types in three U.S. cities: Baltimore, MD., Washington, D.C., and New York City, NY. The linguistic patterns reflect the spatiotemporal context of the places where the social media content is posted. We further construct a method to link what people post online to the activities conducted within a city. We then use these derived activities to profile the characteristics of neighborhoods in the three cities, and apply the activity signatures to discover similar neighborhoods both within and between the cities. This approach represents a novel activity-based method for assessing similarity between neighborhoods.}

Chapters 5 and 6Chapter 5Chapter 6 explore how and why a small minority of individuals transcend this and become ‘super-contributors’. This process is central to why academic crowdsourcing has developed in the way it has, and begs the question of how crowdsourcing activities create memory, and what kinds of memory are created. Drawing on existing descriptions of collective and individual memory, this chapter explores further some of the case studies presented earlier in the volume. It is argued that individualized narrative memories of the subject area of the asset concerned can be distinguished from ‘methodological narratives’ about the tasks and tools involved, which are more susceptible to be shared among the contributor community.}

This study investigates how the actual provision of cultural services is distributed across the landscape according to spatially varying relationships. The final aim was to analyse how landscape settings are associated to people's preferences and perceptions related to cultural ecosystem services in mountain landscapes. We demonstrated a spatially explicit method based on geo-tagged images from popular social media to assess revealed preferences. A spatially weighted regression showed that specific variables correspond to prominent drivers of cultural ecosystem services at the local scale. The results of this explanatory approach can be used to integrate the cultural service dimension into land planning by taking into account specific benefiting areas and by setting priorities on the ecosystems and landscape characteristics which affect the service supply. We finally concluded that the use of crowdsourced data allows identifying spatial patterns of cultural ecosystem service preferences and their association with landscape settings.}

Considering the fact that the term of seismic resilience can describe the quality of the urban fabrics to respond and recover after occurrence of a seismic event and existence of required infrastructures for effective adaption; enormous efforts have been paid to the quantification and proposal of comprehensive resilience frameworks. Although there are precious achievements in the literature toward the provision of theoretical background for calculation of resilience as a time dependent vulnerability function; the lack of reliable data to verify these models persuade researchers to the application of indicator systems using descriptors to measure different dimensions of resilience. In this paper, a new indicator system is proposed to quantify the seismic resilience in urban areas focusing on the specific challenges to which the developing countries such as Iran are faced. An AHP based approach has been conducted to identify the most important factors that must be included in the model, as well as, their relative contributions through weighting process. The model utilizing 37 indicators, 13 thematic areas and 5 sectors has been developed and examined by implementation in two selected case studies from metropolitan of Tehran and Kish Island in Persian Gulf. The new model has been verified by comparing its ability to reproduce logical quantified resilience values calculated by an already-developed simple model in the literature. The results confirm the potential engagement of quantitative resilience evaluation as a practical step in the context of integrated disaster risk management.}

The importance of these activities is increasing, especially in the last decade, which has witnessed an enormous expansion of geospatial data use in general and especially among mass users. Although geospatial data producers are striving to define and present data-quality standards to users and users increasingly need to assess the fitness for use of the data, the success of these activities is still far from what is expected or required. As a consequence, neglect or misunderstanding of data quality among users results in misuse or risks. This paper presents an aid in spatio-temporal quality evaluation through the use of spatio-temporal evaluation matrices (STEM) and the index of spatio-temporal anticipations (INSTANT) matrices. With the help of these two simple tools, geospatial data producers can systematically categorize and visualize the granularity of their spatio-temporal data, and users can present their requirements in the same way using business intelligence principles and a Web 2.0 approach. The basic principles and some examples are presented in the paper, and potential further applied research activities are briefly described.}

The results demonstrate the benefits of bringing human and remote sensing sources together in a framework of hot spot analysis for a megacity such as Mexico City. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that human and remote sensing work well together in detecting the expansion of illegal urban settlements. Looking at the driving factors of illegal settlements, the existence of strong association between the expansion of illegal urban settlements and socioeconomic factors such as unemployment, provides some answers and reveals new questions. Illegal urban growth often leads to the loss of ecological areas in the urban frontiers, especially in areas where the urbanization potential is high. As a consequence, there are conflicts with legal settlers who dislike the illegal expansion. This approach can be extended to and replicated in new urbanizing areas, in particular in Africa and Asia.}

This paper focuses on analysing the governance possibilities of using participative geographic information like volunteered and public participatory geographic information for flood risk reduction in the case of Santiago de Chile, a city which regularly experiences urban floods during rainy seasons. Based on in-depth interviews and document analysis, our study indicates that a relevant part of the current information used for flood risk reduction efforts is provided to local and regional authorities by the affected population. Though, local actors are not recognized by central agencies as valid agents for the production of official information. Moreover, there are neither instances of communication or deliberation with the community, which reduces the capacity of local actors to discuss possible solutions. Participative geographic instruments are seen as potential mechanisms to strengthen work relations among local actors and authorities, by enhancing new logics for producing and sharing information. The impacts for the current risk governance system though can be diverse depending on the participants' level of commitment of participants and the political relations between actors and agencies. Considered as merely data acquisition and analysis mechanisms, participative instruments reproduce the existing hierarchical top-down structures. Furthermore, local-based approaches can enhance local work, support local diagnostics and increase the decision capacity of citizens.}

The public participatory softGIS survey delivers information on the perception of urban green spaces, which we use as a criterion for dividing green space categories in a hedonic pricing model. We find that the perception expressed in the survey is generally consistent with the impact on property prices in the case of formal green spaces. However, it is inconsistent when it comes to informal ones: places identified as lacking well-maintained greenery exert a positive influence on property prices, while positively evaluated informal green spaces had no impact at all. We identify the latter as a typical trade-off between different value perspectives: informal green spaces are perceived differently following a monetary and a non-monetary approach.}

Between 2010 and 2014 a recovery index was formulated based on spatial indicators, such as building condition and building use, to measure the progress of the recovery process in L’Aquila. Eight years after the earthquake, the work presented in this paper was used to update the recovery index, not only by measuring the progress of the recovery in L’Aquila but also by validating the usefulness of the proposed recovery index. To achieve this objective, the current research considered the same set of spatial indicators that were used to determine the progress of the recovery in L’Aquila by 2010, 2012, and 2014 in the revaluation of the expert criteria. It was found that in 2016 the number of reconstructed buildings and buildings under ongoing construction had significantly increased and the number of buildings with residential and commercial use had increased along the main roads. While progress was observed in the overall building condition, there was no significant progress in the building use. This poses several questions about how the recovery process can contribute to the return of the inhabitants to the city center of L’Aquila. The paper concludes that the proposed recovery index is useful for identifying the spatial pattern of the recovery process in an urban area affected by an earthquake. At the same time, this recovery index allows the recovery progress to be quantified based on indicators.}

In this paper we are questioning the hypothesis whether geospatial information infrastructures, in terms of standards-based geospatial services, technologies, and data models as operational assets already in place, can be exploited by health applications for which the geospatial dimension is of great importance. This may be certainly addressed by defining better collaboration strategies to uncover and promote geospatial assets to the health community.

The approach we have devised is simple, generic and does not depend on field data collection or restricted-access data (such as satellite images, commercial databases, etc.), which can be either too expensive for larger areas or simply unavailable. We also show how maps can be built to represent such measures in an intuitive manner that allows the visual comparison of different areas and cities. Its practical utilization is demonstrated by a case study comprising busy central areas of six large cities in three different continents: Latin America, United States and Europe. The results and insights we present can help different stakeholders, from carriers to local authorities understand the difficulties of a new delivery operation as well as identify more critical areas that may require more attention or some intervention.}

But despite long held assumptions about intra-disciplinary engagements between its “human” and “physical” branches, geography's weakness as a discipline is that it has yet to gather sufficient momentum to collectively shape and implement practical and sustainable climate change policies and actions (Castree, 2014a). However, by considering together the heuristic values of the concepts of the Anthropocene and Planetary Boundaries, the Anglo-American sphere of geography recognizes in either ironic, or unconscious manners that a new strand of environmental determinism (discredited by geographical thought and practice in the early twentieth century) has re-emerged to elide the role of human agency and broadly dominate the discussion of climate change. Mike Hulme (2011, 247) states that “climate determinism” is “a form of analysis and prediction in which climate is first extracted from the matrix of interdependencies that shape human life within the physical world”. Within this discourse it is often the biophysical sphere that is employed to explain the course of human behavior; consequently, this dominating perspective threatens to skew our predictions and understandings of future societies, cultures, climates and destinies. Climate change will certainly constrain human agency, but it also creates the potential for geography to play to its intra and inter disciplinary strengths and begin discussing and addressing human-environmental dilemmas in practical and realistic ways; and secondly, seize the climate change crisis as an opportunity to study where, why and for whom global environmental change matters. Firstly, this paper considers a theoretical balance between the NHC, the Anthropocene and Planetary Boundaries as a way forward for geography to begin addressing the common dilemma of climate change. Within this consideration it engages Anne Buttimer's geographical translation of Martin Heidegger's lebenswelt as a dimension of the NHC. Secondly, the paper discusses how GeoHumanities and GIScience integrations with phenomenology, the digital and environmental humanities and social media generated “Big-Data” can explore the perceptual scales and scopes of the NHC/Anthropocene/Planetary Boundaries conceptual triad. Lastly, it argues that such integrations are salient to the study of emerging Smart City Lifeworlds as a means to engage the increasing urban agencies of global climate change driven by the vagaries of the human condition.}

Thereby, many social content sites are starting to allow users to enrich their tags with semantic metadata, such as the GeoSocial Content Sites, for example, where users can annotate their tags with geographic metadata. But geographic metadata alone only unveils a very specific facet of a tag, which leads to the need for more general purpose semantic metadata.

In this paper, we present a detailed investigation of the spatial properties of two open gazetteers with worldwide coverage: GeoNames, and the Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names (TGN). Using point density maps, correlations, and linear regressions, we analyze the global spatial coverage of each data source for the full set of features and for top feature types: populated places, streams, mountains, and hills. Results show wide discrepancies in coverage between the two datasets, sharp changes in feature type coverage across country borders, and idiosyncratic patterns dominated by a few countries for the more sparsely covered natural features. As more and more systems rely on recognizing and grounding named places, these patterns can influence the analysis of growing amounts of online text content and reinforce or amplify existing inequalities.}

It is normally difficult to accurately differentiate road from its background due to the complex geometry of the buildings and the acquisition geometry of the sensor. In this paper, we present a new method for extracting roads from high-resolution imagery based on hierarchical graph-based image segmentation. The proposed method consists of: 1. Extracting features (e.g., using Gabor and morphological filtering) to enhance the contrast between road and non-road pixels, 2. Graph-based segmentation consisting of (i) Constructing a graph representation of the image based on initial segmentation and (ii) Hierarchical merging and splitting of image segments based on color and shape features, and 3. Post-processing to remove irregularities in the extracted road segments. Experiments are conducted on three challenging datasets of high-resolution images to demonstrate the proposed method and compare with other similar approaches. The results demonstrate the validity and superior performance of the proposed method for road extraction in urban areas.}

abstract = {Automatic monitoring of changes on the Earth’s surface is an intrinsic capability and simultaneously a persistent methodological challenge in remote sensing, especially regarding imagery with very-high spatial resolution (VHR) and complex urban environments. In order to enable a high level of automatization, the change detection problem is solved in an unsupervised way to alleviate efforts associated with collection of properly encoded prior knowledge. In this context, this paper systematically investigates the nature and effects of class distribution and class imbalance in an unsupervised binary change detection application based on VHR imagery over urban areas. For this purpose, a diagnostic framework for sensitivity analysis of a large range of possible degrees of class imbalance is presented, which is of particular importance with respect to unsupervised approaches where the content of images and thus the occurrence and the distribution of classes are generally unknown a priori. Furthermore, this framework can serve as a general technique to evaluate model transferability in any two-class classification problem. The applied change detection approach is based on object-based difference features calculated from VHR imagery and subsequent unsupervised two-class clustering using k‐means, genetic k-means and self-organizing map (SOM) clustering. The results from two test sites with different structural characteristics of the built environment demonstrated that classification performance is generally worse in imbalanced class distribution settings while best results were reached in balanced or close to balanced situations. Regarding suitable accuracy measures for evaluating model performance in imbalanced settings, this study revealed that the Kappa statistics show significant response to class distribution while the true skill statistic was widely insensitive to imbalanced classes. In general, the genetic k-means clustering algorithm achieved the most robust results with respect to class imbalance while the SOM clustering exhibited a distinct optimization towards a balanced distribution of classes.}

The increase in readily available, location-based social media data offers scholars important new data for understanding this relationship. This study examines the relationship between the spatial distribution of geotagged tweets and key characteristics of the built environment at the census block group level in Chicago. First, we performed a hotspot analysis to ascertain the distribution of tweets in the study area. Then, we employed a count regression model with Twitter message counts by census block group as the dependent variable to test the significance and magnitude of the associations between the built environment and tweeting. After that, we standardized the coefficients to compare the variables’ effects on tweeting. The analysis found that the built environment significantly influenced tweeting and provides empirical statistical evidence to guide urban planners’ placemaking decisions.}

This question fits into broader discussions on how knowledge construction, circulation and utilization can improve competences in local government (efficiency and effectiveness), make urban planning more knowledge-based, and provide greater recognition of citizens’ knowledge (accountability). Local governments need such instruments in dealing with increasing complexity and uncertainty in urban development. We examine how uneven patterns of technological change in using ICT and GIS are transforming current local government work processes in terms of efficiency and effectiveness in their outcomes, utilizing empirical data from extended case studies in six medium-sized cities in India, South Africa, Brazil, and Peru, participating in the Chance2Sustain research network. Knowledge management in cities is configured through several dimensions: 1) discourses for digitizing KM in local urban development; 2) actor networks producing socio-spatial knowledge; 3) embedding KM in decision-making processes (power struggles, exclusion); and 4) influences of KM on work practices and interfaces with citizens. The case study results show that 1) KM discourses concerned four issues: strategic urban planning and integrated land use planning; determining geographic boundaries in urban development discourses; streamlining work processes of local governments, and mapping poverty and needs assessments; 2) initiatives mainly link government with the private sector at various scale levels; 3) codified and technical knowledge remains dominant in discussions on urban development; and 4) effects of KM are uneven, but improve work process efficiency, although the interface with citizens remains limited, focusing on middle-class relations to the exclusion of the poor.}

This paper presents the results regarding the evolution of OSM road networks in Beijing, China, from four aspects. First, findings from general analysis indicate that (1) the overall growth pattern could be mainly explained by the increasing number of volunteers and their mapping contributions. Second, findings from geometric analysis suggest: (2) mapping intensity exhibits heavy-tailed pattern both for a certain time period and across time; (3) mapping direction moves from outskirts to downtown distinguished from other regions; and (4) mapping behaviors are mainly constrained by the underlying structure of road networks. Third, results of topological analysis indicate that (5) OSM road networks resemble the growth of real road networks and are undergoing an evolution process depicted by exploration and densification. Last, from the perspective of centrality analysis, (6) two kinds of nodes are identified with the ones accounting for the exploration and the other ones for the densification, which further hints the evolution process of continuous strong exploration accompanied by weak densification.}

abstract = {Viewshed analysis is a GIS tool commonly used in a number of research and practical spatial analyses. Input data and their spatial uncertainty are important aspects affecting analysis reliability. Given that inappropriately selected input geodata can produce imprecise visibility models and as a result cause incorrect spatial decisions, quantifying the effect of this uncertainty on resulting visibility models is important for the models' subsequent use. The objective of our study was to evaluate the suitability of digital surface models with varying levels of detail (a LiDAR-based model and models based upon vector data at differing scales) for simple (binary) viewshed analysis of wind turbines (three wind parks each containing 3–6 turbines). Visibility models based upon this input data were compared with actual visibility from 150 control points at random locations. The study results confirmed the prediction that the viewshed model based on more precise input data corresponded more closely to reality. Moreover, our study is the first to demonstrate that only the number of false positives (where the model predicts that an object is visible while in reality it is not) depended on input data precision, while input data did not affect the false negatives. In addition, all vector-based models had far more false positives than false negatives, while the opposite was true for the LiDAR-based model. When we considered the same number of modeled and actually visible wind turbines as a model's matching of reality, there were matches at 83.6–93.7% of control points (95% confidence interval) for the LiDAR-based model. For models based upon vector maps of various scales, the intervals were 68.4–82.2% (1:10,000), 59.1–74.2% (1:25,000), and 48.1–63.9% (1:500,000). We recorded false positives in 6 cases with the LiDAR-based model and 26, 39, and 59 cases, respectively, for vector-based models.}

abstract = {The remarkable growth of wind energy in the last twenty years has been accompanied by a rapid spread of wind turbines (WTs) in many European countries, sometimes creating new landscapes that we are supposed to call “windscapes”. This paper aims to map the EU regions characterized by a very high density of WTs in those ten EU countries, which for various reasons have become key players in the wind energy sector in Europe. We use the crowdsourced data from a participative mapping project, the OpenStreetMap (OSM), created in 2004 in order to build and share online a free editable map of the world. First, we automatically extract the geographical position of each WT, thus creating a GIS of WTs for each of the EU countries under examination. Having certified the reliability of OSM data, we have to estimate the concentration of WTs. For this reason, we assume that the search radius around each windmill corresponds to its visual impact threshold (roughly equal to 10 km). Applying the ‘point density’ function in a GIS environment, we create the map density of WTs in the study area. In order to have a clear visualization of the impact of the wind energy policies adopted by each EU member state, this map is then compared with the map of wind resources created in 1989. What emerges are two very different situations in the study area: while in the north, Germany and Denmark have seen a massive spread of WTs all over their countries, WTs in the south are mainly concentrated in only a few windy areas of Spain, Portugal and Italy. Moreover, almost 1350 Km2 of land distributed in four member states (Germany, Italy, Spain and United Kingdom) can be said to be characterized by a very high density of WTs (over than 200 WTs in a circle area with a radius of 10 Km).}

As a result, an automatic/semi-automatic method for mapping urban functional zones is highly required. Hierarchical semantic cognition (HSC) is presented in this study, and serves as a general cognition structure for recognizing urban functional zones. Unlike traditional classification methods, the HSC relies on geographic cognition and considers four semantic layers, i.e., visual features, object categories, spatial object patterns, and zone functions, as well as their hierarchical relations. Here, we used HSC to classify functional zones in Beijing with a very-high-resolution (VHR) satellite image and point-of-interest (POI) data. Experimental results indicate that this method can produce more accurate results than Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) with a larger overall accuracy of 90.8%. Additionally, the contributions of diverse semantic layers are quantified: the object-category layer is the most important and makes 54% contribution to functional-zone classification; while, other semantic layers are less important but their contributions cannot be ignored. Consequently, the presented HSC is effective in classifying urban functional zones, and can further support urban planning and management.}

Consequently, new adapted query propagation approaches that take into account geospatial aspects of data are needed. Different existing query propagation approaches use various criteria to select relevant sources. In addition, many approaches rely on existing semantic mappings between sources; however, in ad hoc networks, sources move autonomously and in a dynamic fashion. Our goal is rather to reduce the number of sources that must be accessed to answer a query and, therefore, to reduce the volume of semantic mappings that needs to be computed to answer the query. In this paper, we propose three real time query propagation strategies to address this issue. Those strategies reproduce the behavior of members of a social network. The strategies are designed to be part of a real time semantic interoperability framework for ad hoc networks of geospatial databases. The strategies have been formalized with the Lightweight Coordination Calculus (LCC), which support distributed interactions based on social norms and constraints. The implementation and testing of the strategies show that they complement each other to provide optimal query answers.}

A time-series stack of 36 TerraSAR-X Stripmap images and roughly six million social media messages were processed, classified, and visually and quantitatively analyzed for an experiment in Shanghai. We derived four possible cases of land classification by combining the results of both sources to a single raster layer at a 400m cell size. Quantifying these cases in a 2-by-2 confusion matrix shows positive and negative matches between built-up areas and social media messages. We see that correlation of positive matches is 72%. A combination of remotely sensed and social media data is a step towards a more granular analysis of urbanization processes than is possible from either data source alone.

Our ability to visualize this type of information has rapidly improved with the proliferation of social media sites throughout the Internet in recent years. While many methods to extract information on human behavior from crowdsourced geodata already exist, this paper focuses on visualizing landscape perception for application to the fields of landscape and urban planning. Visualization of peoples’ perceptual responses to landscape is demonstrated with crowdsourced photo geodata from Flickr, a popular photo sharing community. A basic, general method to map, visualize, and evaluate perception and perceptual values is proposed. The approach utilizes common tools for spatial knowledge discovery and builds on existing research, but is specifically designed for implementation within the context of landscape perception analysis and particularly suited as a base for further evaluation in multiple scenarios. To demonstrate the process in application, three novel types of visualizations are presented: the mapping of sightlines in Yosemite Valley, the assessment of landscape change in the area surrounding the High Line in Manhattan, and individual location analysis for Coit Tower in San Francisco. The results suggest that analyzing crowdsourced data may contribute to a more balanced assessment of the perceived landscape, which provides a basis for a better integration of public values into planning processes.}

Yet the adoption of such datasets in conservation science may be hindered by a perception that the data are of low quality. This perception likely stems from the propensity of data generated by CS to contain greater levels of variability (e.g., measurement error) or bias (e.g., spatio-temporal clustering) in comparison to data collected by scientists or instruments. Modern analytical approaches can account for many types of error and bias typical of CS datasets. It is possible to (1) describe how pseudo-replication in sampling influences the overall variability in response data using mixed-effects modeling, (2) integrate data to explicitly model the sampling process and account for bias using a hierarchical modeling framework, and (3) examine the relative influence of many different or related explanatory factors using machine learning tools. Information from these modeling approaches can be used to predict species distributions and to estimate biodiversity. Even so, achieving the full potential from CS projects requires meta-data describing the sampling process, reference data to allow for standardization, and insightful modeling suitable to the question of interest.}

Online data shared on social networks, particularly geo-tagged photos, are becoming an increasingly attractive source of information about cultural ecosystem services. Landscape photographs tell about the significance of human relationships with landscapes, human practices in landscapes and the landscape features that might possess value in terms of cultural ecosystem services. Despite all the recent advances in this emerging methodological approach, some challenges remain to be explored: (a) how to assess a broad suite of cultural ecosystem services, beyond aesthetic beauty of landscapes, (b) how to identify the landscape features that are relevant for providing cultural ecosystem services and determine trade-offs and synergies among cultural ecosystem services. To address these challenges, we have developed a methodological approach suitable for eliciting the importance of cultural ecosystem services and the landscape features underpinning their provision across five different sites in Europe (in Estonia, Greece, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland). We have performed a content analysis of 1.404 photos uploaded in Flickr and Panoramio platforms that can represent cultural ecosystem services. Four bundles of landscapes features and cultural ecosystem services showed the relation of recreation with mountain areas (terrestrial recreation) and with water bodies (aquatic recreation). Cultural heritage, social and spiritual values were particularly attached to landscapes with woodpastures and grasslands, as well as urban features and infrastructures, i.e. to more anthropogenic landscapes. A positive though weak relationship was found between landscape diversity and cultural ecosystem services diversity. Particularly wood-pastures and shrubs were more frequently portrayed in all study sites in comparison with their actual land cover. The results can be of interest both for methodological purposes in the face of an increasing trend in the use of geo-tagged photos in the ecosystem services research and for the elicitation and comparison of landscape values across European cultural landscapes.}

abstract = {Agricultural modeling has long suffered from fragmentation in model implementation. Many models are developed, there is much redundancy, models are often poorly coupled, model component re-use is rare, and it is frequently difficult to apply models to generate real solutions for the agricultural sector. To improve this situation, we argue that an open, self-sustained, and committed community is required to co-develop agricultural models and associated data and tools as a common resource. Such a community can benefit from recent developments in information and communications technology (ICT). We examine how such developments can be leveraged to design and implement the next generation of data, models, and decision support tools for agricultural production systems. Our objective is to assess relevant technologies for their maturity, expected development, and potential to benefit the agricultural modeling community. The technologies considered encompass methods for collaborative development and for involving stakeholders and users in development in a transdisciplinary manner. Our qualitative evaluation suggests that as an overall research challenge, the interoperability of data sources, modular granular open models, reference data sets for applications and specific user requirements analysis methodologies need to be addressed to allow agricultural modeling to enter in the big data era. This will enable much higher analytical capacities and the integrated use of new data sources. Overall agricultural systems modeling needs to rapidly adopt and absorb state-of-the-art data and ICT technologies with a focus on the needs of beneficiaries and on facilitating those who develop applications of their models. This adoption requires the widespread uptake of a set of best practices as standard operating procedures.}

abstract = {As the share of urban population increases globally each year, man-dominated systems tend to sprawl over the natural ones, substituting and fragmenting them. Urban sprawl is the main cause of many environmental issues, in tight connection with pollution and loss of biodiversity. One of the main consequences is a decrease of the ecosystem services provided by the urban green infrastructure. However, the extent of urban sprawl is spatially uneven due to the spatial structure of human settlements. Among the methods used to pinpoint sprawl, fractal analyses have a good potential for analyzing fragmentation, especially if used in conjunction with statistical methods. This study aimed to assess, in an exploratory perspective, the level of fragmentation in the Romanian cities covered by the Urban Atlas data, and determine its correlation with parameters related to their demographical and physical characteristics. In addition, taxonomical analyses were used to find whether cities or specific components of the green infrastructure can be grouped. The results did not reveal a general trend, although it seems that the green infrastructure consisted of agricultural/ semi-natural/ wetland areas, forests, green areas, sports and leisure facilities and water bodies in all of them, in different shares; with respect to their distribution, the numerical taxonomy analysis indicated that they form classes matching the types of ‘nature in the city’ previously described by ecologists, despite the particular historical evolution of each city and its particular influence on urban planning. The correlation analysis revealed that the population and its density and the share of the green infrastructure within the total area are significantly correlated with most fractal parameters. Similarly, the fractal dimension of the area, computed using Interactive Quantitative Morphology, seems to correlate with most morphological parameters. However, the taxonomical analysis of cities did not find very relevant groups due to the fact that many large Romanian cities lack Urban Atlas data. The results suggest that the degree of urban fragmentation is correlated especially with the population of cities and its density, reclaiming planning measures aimed at controlling the densification processes (sprawl, gentrification, location of specific activities etc.)}

abstract = {In recent years earthquakes and their secondary hazards have claimed the largest number of lives of all large natural disasters. Some of the world’s most earthquake-prone zones are also areas of high population density. The impact is magnified by vulnerability factors including non-enforcement of building codes, knowledge gaps, urban poverty and poor governance capacity to manage and reduce earthquake risks. Poor security of land tenure and property rights increases the vulnerability of people and affects their ability to respond to natural disasters. Earthquake recovery and reconstruction provides very significant challenges for land agencies, with these challenges differing from one country to the next due to differences in the local context. Drawing on contrasting case studies in Haiti, Nepal and New Zealand this paper identifies the common post-earthquake land administration functions and challenges that may apply to many contexts. These lessons provide land agencies and other key stakeholders with a summary of the challenges an earthquake poses for land administration at different post-disaster stages. We also discuss the policy and regulatory, institutional, operational and preparedness lessons for land administration. From these lessons we propose a framework for evaluating the earthquake-responsiveness of a land administration system. This framework can be used by a land agency in an earthquake prone region, or where an earthquake has recently occurred, to assess what challenges to land administration might occur in the event of an earthquake, and the preparedness of their land administration system.}

abstract = {A significant barrier to the use of public participation GIS (PPGIS) and crowd-sourcing for conservation planning is uncertainty about the quality of the spatial data generated. This study examines the quality of PPGIS data for use in conservation planning. We evaluate two dimensions of spatial data quality, positional accuracy and data completeness using empirical PPGIS data from a statewide study of public lands in Victoria, Australia. Using an expert-derived spatial conservation model for Victoria as a benchmark, we quantify the performance of a crowd-sourced public in their capacity to accurately and comprehensively identify areas of high conservation importance in the PPGIS process. About 70% of PPGIS points that identified biological/conservation values were spatially coincident (position accurate) with modeled areas of high conservation importance, with greater accuracy associated with locations in existing protected areas. PPGIS data had less positional accuracy when participants identified biological values in urban areas and on non-public lands in general. The PPGIS process did not comprehensively identify all the largest, contiguous areas of high conservation importance in the state, missing about 20% of areas, primarily on small public land units in less densely populated regions of the state. Preferences for increased conservation/protection were over-represented in areas proximate to the Melbourne urban area and under-represented in more remote statewide locations. Our results indicate that if PPGIS data is to be integrated into spatial models for conservation planning, it is important to account for the spatial accuracy and completeness limitations identified in this study (i.e., urban areas, non-public lands, and smaller remote locations). The spatial accuracy and completeness of PPGIS data in this study suggests spatial data quality may be “good enough” to complement biological data in conservation planning but perhaps not good enough to overcome the mistrust associated with crowd-sourced knowledge. Recommendations to improve PPGIS data quality for prospective conservation planning applications are discussed.}

Specifically, LCC and ROI of five mitigation scenarios that include large-scale catchment rehabilitation, settlement set-backs and waste management are compared with the current situation. The main result is that the highest-performing flood mitigation option includes both conventional interventions and ecosystem rehabilitation.}

The increasing use of ICTs in social interactions has facilitated informal ways of organizing and affected the participation, emergence, and organizing of conflictual and consensual collective actions. In this study we seek to understand how the integrated use of multiple ICTs, that is the ICT ensemble, affects the organizing of consensual collective action. We investigated the ICT ensembles used by two civic movements that successfully organized large-scale consensual collective action events in two European countries. In our results, we reveal how ICT ensembles constrained and facilitated the organizing functions and requirements of collective action. The findings show that ICTs allow organizers to operate purposefully in order to organize collective action, but the extent to which they succeed in the actual concretization of collective action actually depends on their capacities and intents. Therefore, we argue that human factors (that is, their resourcefulness and agency) are greatly implicated in the success of collective action supported by ICTs. This study extends the research on impact of technology-enabled collective action by looking at the combined use of multiple ICTs and examining the rare and overlooked phenomenon of consensual collective action.}

Existing spatially-enabled solutions for managing urban disasters provide limited support for time-sensitivity and urgency underlying emergency situations. These approaches mainly suffer from low temporal resolution and inability to source a broad range of required disaster data, together with insufficient support for automated operations. However, disaster management procedures, integrated with in situ sensing, promise an extensive range of real-time data and automated processes to acquire and manage disaster information. In this research, we study the process of integrating multi-agency in situ sensors for supporting disaster management. For this purpose, the research was adopted in Australia as the case study area in disaster management of a flood by emphasizing on the response phase. This paper first identifies the issues and existing requirements in the process of multi-agency sensor information integration and then proposes a standard-based approach to overcoming these integration issues. Afterward, based on the presented approach and identified requirements, a GIS-based software IDDSS-Sensor is implemented to provide the functions of standard-based access, as well as on-the-fly harmonization, integration and usage of multi-agency sensor information. We evaluate the applicability of our developed approach by applying it to the use case of supporting flash flood evacuation response.}

During the last decade three global land cover datasets have been created, i.e. the GLC-2000, MODIS and GlobCover, but comparison studies have shown that there are large spatial discrepancies between these three products. One of the reasons for these discrepancies is the lack of sufficient in-situ data for the development of these products. To address this issue, a crowdsourcing tool called Geo-Wiki has been developed. Geo-Wiki has two main aims: to increase the amount of in-situ land cover data available for training, calibration and validation, and to create a hybrid global land cover map that provides more accurate land cover information than any current individual product. This paper outlines the components that comprise Geo-Wiki and how they are integrated in the architectural design. An overview of the main functionality of Geo-Wiki is then provided along with the current usage statistics and the lessons learned to date, in particular the need to add a mechanism for feedback and interaction as part of community building, and the need to address issues of data quality.

The cartographic definition and representation of CBD is of great significance in studying the urban development and its functions. In order to facilitate these processes, the Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is a very efficient tool as it considers the decay impact of services and allows the enrichment of the information from a very simple input scatter plot to a smooth output density surface. However, most existing methods of density analysis consider geographic events in a homogeneous and isotropic space under Euclidean space representation. Considering the case that the physical movement in the urban environment is usually constrained by a street network, we propose a different method for the delimitation of CBD with network configurations. First, starting from the locations of central activities, a concentration index is presented to visualize the functional urban environment by means of a density surface, which is refined with network distances rather than Euclidean ones. Then considering the specialties of network distance computation problem, an efficient way supported by flow extension simulation is proposed. Taking Shenzhen and Guangzhou, two quite developed cities in China as two case studies, we demonstrate the easy implementation and practicability of our method in delineating CBD.}

When done thoughtfully, this approach to citizen science can transform humans and their environment. Despite such possibilities, many projects struggle to meet decision-maker needs, generate useful data to inform decisions, and improve social-ecological resilience. Here, we define leveraging the ‘power of place’ in citizen science, and posit that doing this improves conservation decision making, increases participation, and improves community resilience. First, we explore ‘place’ and identify five place dimensions: social-ecological, narrative and name-based, knowledge-based, emotional and affective, and performative. We then thematically analyze 134 case studies drawn from CitSci.org (n=39), The Stewardship Network New England (TSN-NE; n=39), and Earthwatch (n=56) regarding: (1) use of place dimensions in materials (as one indication of leveraging the power of place), (2) intent for use of data in decision-making, and (3) evidence of such use. We find that 89% of projects intend for data to be used, 46% demonstrate no evidence of use, and 54% provide some evidence of use. Moreover, projects used in decision making leverage more (t=−4.8, df=117; p<0.001) place dimensions (x̅=3.0; s=1.4) than those not used in decision making (x̅=1.8; s=1.2). Further, a Principal Components Analysis identifies three related components (aesthetic, narrative and name-based, and social-ecological). Given these findings, we present a framework for leveraging place in citizen science projects and platforms, and recommend approaches to better impart intended outcomes. We discuss place in citizen science related to relevance, participation, resilience, and scalability and conclude that effective decision making as a means towards more resilient and sustainable communities can be strengthened by leveraging the power of place in citizen science.}

abstract = {With increasing point of interest (POI) datasets available with fine-grained spatial and temporal attributes, space–time Ripley’s K function has been regarded as a powerful approach to analyze spatiotemporal point process. However, space–time Ripley’s K function is computationally intensive for point-wise distance comparisons, edge correction and simulations for significance testing. Parallel computing technologies like OpenMP, MPI and CUDA have been leveraged to accelerate the K function, and related experiments have demonstrated the substantial acceleration. Nevertheless, previous works have not extended optimization of Ripley’s K function from space dimension to space–time dimension. Without sophisticated spatiotemporal query and partitioning mechanisms, extra computational overhead can be problematic. Meanwhile, these researches were limited by the restricted scalability and relative expensive programming cost of parallel frameworks and impeded their applications for large POI dataset and Ripley’s K function variations. This paper presents a distributed computing method to accelerate space–time Ripley’s K function upon state-of-the-art distributed computing framework Apache Spark, and four strategies are adopted to simplify calculation procedures and accelerate distributed computing respectively: (1) spatiotemporal index based on R-tree is utilized to retrieve potential spatiotemporally neighboring points with less distance comparison; (2) spatiotemporal edge correction weights are reused by 2-tier cache to reduce repetitive computation in L value estimation and simulations; (3) spatiotemporal partitioning using KDB-tree is adopted to decrease ghost buffer redundancy in partitions and support near-balanced distributed processing; (4) customized serialization with compact representations of spatiotemporal objects and indexes is developed to lower the cost of data transmission. Based on the optimized method, a web-based visual analytics framework prototype has been developed. Experiments prove the feasibility and time efficiency of the proposed method, and also demonstrate its value on promoting applications of space–time Ripley’s K function in ecology, geography, sociology, economics, urban transportation and other fields.}

A total of 3403 inhabitants of the city of Tampere in Finland participated in the study. A web-based public participation GIS survey combining the questionnaires with a map (SoftGIS technique) was used to collect the data. We identified two distinct groups of residents in terms of general neighbourhood preferences. The findings showed that clustering residents based on neighbourhood preferences moderated the association between some features of density measures and travel behaviour. We found significant differences between the two clusters in both the frequencies and the distance of pedestrian and bike travel. The findings revealed that inhabitants of neighbourhoods with a larger percentage of green surroundings had a greater perception of neighbourhood stability than did the residents of neighbourhoods with a smaller percentage of green surroundings.}

International disaster management has become increasingly diverse, encompassing new areas of technical expertise not traditionally considered relevant to the practice.

Disaster management will remain a global topic of concern for many decades to come. To continue to develop the field of risk management, the international disaster management community will have to solve several ongoing issues of contention and sources of uncertainty, including coordination of responders, the role of the media, the development of institutional emergency management capacities, the political will to make risk reduction happen, the prevalence of compound emergencies that make management much more complex, the risks associated with donor fatigue, corruption, uncooperative governments, the importance of ensuring equality in humanitarian assistance and relief distribution, the effect of climate change on the incidence and severity of disasters, a need for improved early warning, a true linkage of risk reduction and development practices, and a distinction between development and reconstruction. Terrorism will continue to play a large role in focusing the agendas of government emergency management agencies. Finally, global disasters, by which all countries are affected in one way or another, will only increase in number.}

However, detailed housing price data are often ill-documented or unavailable for the public, thus posing a grand challenge for the study of housing prices in China. Because individuals' Internet search activities can be recorded by web search engines, the analysis of these web search activities in cyber-space may provide a means of better understanding public attention and associated concerns in real geographic space. In this study, we focus on exploring the spatial patterns of public attention on housing price through the analysis of web query activities based on Baidu Index, a Chinese keyword analysis tool from Baidu web search engine. We propose a new index based on keyword query outcome from Baidu search database to analyze spatially heterogeneous patterns of housing price attention from 19 large and medium-sized cities in China. We evaluate the spatial network structure of housing price attention, and develop a new index to measure the intensity of interaction relationships among cities of interest. Our results show that spatial interactions of housing price attention between cities evaluated using the new method are consistent with those from a gravity model. Meanwhile, as revealed from Baidu Index-based indicators, strong spatial association patterns exist among cities that form urban agglomerations. Further, our results demonstrate that the web search engine approach, based on the coupling of cyber-space and geographic space, provides solid support for the study of housing price attention and its spatially explicit patterns in China.}

abstract = {A Cyberinfrastructure (CI) is a combination of data resources, network protocols, computing platforms, and computational services that brings people, information, and computational tools together to perform science or other data-rich applications in this information-driven world. Most science domains adopt intrinsic geospatial principles (such as spatial constraints in phenomena evolution) for large amounts of geospatial data processing (such as geospatial analysis, feature relationship calculations, geospatial modeling, geovisualization, and geospatial decision support). Geospatial CI (GCI) refers to CI that utilizes geospatial principles and geospatial information to transform how research, development, and education are conducted within and across science domains (such as the environmental and Earth sciences). GCI is based on recent advancements in geographic information science, information technology, computer networks, sensor networks, Web computing, CI, and e-research/e-science. This paper reviews the research, development, education, and other efforts that have contributed to building GCI in terms of its history, objectives, architecture, supporting technologies, functions, application communities, and future research directions. Similar to how GIS transformed the procedures for geospatial sciences, GCI provides significant improvements to how the sciences that need geospatial information will advance. The evolution of GCI will produce platforms for geospatial science domains and communities to better conduct research and development and to better collect data, access data, analyze data, model and simulate phenomena, visualize data and information, and produce knowledge. To achieve these transformative objectives, collaborative research and federated developments are needed for the following reasons: (1) to address social heterogeneity to identify geospatial problems encountered by relevant sciences and applications, (2) to analyze data for information flows and processing needed to solve the identified problems, (3) to utilize Semantic Web to support building knowledge and semantics into future GCI tools, (4) to develop geospatial middleware to provide functional and intermediate services and support service evolution for stakeholders, (5) to advance citizen-based sciences to reflect the fact that cyberspace is open to the public and citizen participation will be essential, (6) to advance GCI to geospatial cloud computing to implement the transparent and opaque platforms required for addressing fundamental science questions and application problems, and (7) to develop a research and development agenda that addresses these needs with good federation and collaboration across GCI communities, such as government agencies, non-government organizations, industries, academia, and the public.}

abstract = {While geocoding returns coordinates for a full or partial address, the converse process of reverse geocoding maps coordinates to a set of candidate place identifiers such as addresses or toponyms. For example, numerous Web APIs map geographic point coordinates, e.g., from a user’s smartphone, to an ordered set of nearby Places Of Interest (POI). Typically, these services return the k nearest POI within a certain radius and measure distance to order the results. Reverse geocoding is a crucial task for many applications and research questions as it translates between spatial and platial views on geographic location. What makes this process difficult is the uncertainty of the queried location and of the point features used to represent places. Even if both could be determined with a high level of accuracy, it would still be unclear how to map a smartphone’s GPS fix to one of many possible places in a multi-story building or a shopping mall. In this work, we break up the dependency on space alone by introducing time as a second variable for reverse geocoding. We mine the geosocial behavior of users of online location-based social networks to extract temporal semantic signatures. In analogy to the notion of scale distortion in cartography, we present a model that uses these signatures to distort the location of POI relative to the query location and time, thereby reordering the set of potentially matching places. We demonstrate the strengths of our method by evaluating it against a purely spatial baseline by determining the Mean Reciprocal Rank and the normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain. Our method performs substantially better than said baseline.}

I will rely on the essential functions of maps – to describe or to conceptualize – and investigate what from now could be called an iconic junction, that is, the link, identified by the categories of conjunction and disjunction, which comes to exist between landscape figuration and cartographic figuration. This chapter aims not only to reflect on abstract categories but also to illustrate the relationship between these two figurative forms, recovering their underlying metrics. This will be done with a view to understanding the nature and outcome of that connection, and with it its inner meshes, over which other forms of representation freed from topographic metrics may be tested.}

The earliest developers of land-cover maps recognized the importance of evaluating the quality of their maps, and the methods and reporting format of these early accuracy assessments included features that would be familiar to practitioners today. Specifically, practitioners have consistently recognized the importance of obtaining high quality reference data to which the map is compared, the need for sampling to collect these reference data, and the role of an error matrix and accuracy measures derived from the error matrix to summarize the accuracy information. Over the past half century these techniques have undergone refinements to place accuracy assessment on a more scientifically credible footing. We describe the current status of accuracy assessment that has emerged from nearly 50 years of practice and identify opportunities for future advances. The article is organized by the three major components of accuracy assessment, the sampling design, response design, and analysis, focusing on good practice methodology that contributes to a rigorous, informative, and honest assessment. The long history of research and applications underlying the current practice of accuracy assessment has advanced the field to a mature state. However, documentation of accuracy assessment methods needs to be improved to enhance reproducibility and transparency, and improved methods are required to address new challenges created by advanced technology that has expanded the capacity to map land cover extensively in space and intensively in time.}

Unconsciously, we have entered an era of big earth data, also called remote sensing (RS) big data. Although RS big data provides great opportunities for a broad range of applications such as disaster rescue, global security, and so forth, it inevitably poses many additional processing challenges. As one of the most fundamental and important tasks in RS big data mining, image retrieval (i.e., image information mining) from RS big data has attracted continuous research interests in the last several decades. This paper mainly works for systematically reviewing the emerging achievements for image retrieval from RS big data. And then this paper further discusses the RS image retrieval based applications including fusion-oriented RS image processing, geo-localization and disaster rescue. To facilitate the quantitative evaluation of the RS image retrieval technique, this paper gives a list of publicly open datasets and evaluation metrics, and briefly recalls the mainstream methods on two representative benchmarks of RS image retrieval. Considering the latest advances from multiple domains including computer vision, machine learning and knowledge engineering, this paper points out some promising research directions towards RS big data mining. From this survey, engineers from industry may find skills to improve their RS image retrieval systems and researchers from academia may find ideas to conduct some innovative work.}

The case study used in NextCampus was taken from the real-world question of a possible move of a university campus to a new location in the city of Hamburg, Germany. The development of the serious public participatory game NextCampus resulted in a physical prototype, user interface design, and a computational model of the game. The NextCampus game was tested with the help of two groups of urban planning students and presented to three external experts who provided valuable recommendations for further development.

We implemented a public participation GIS (PPGIS) system in the remote Kimberley region of Australia to identify the spatial values and preferences for marine and coastal areas. We assessed similarities and differences in PPGIS participants (N = 578) using three operational definitions for “stakeholder” based on: (1) self-identified group, (2) self-identified future interests in the region, and (3) participant value orientation that reflects a preferred trade-off between environmental and economic outcomes. We found moderate levels of association between alternative stakeholder classifications that were logically related to general and place-specific participatory mapping behavior in the study region. We then analyzed how stakeholder classifications influence specific management preferences for proposed marine protected areas (MPAs) in the study region. Conservation-related values and preferences dominated the mapped results in all proposed marine reserves, the likely result of volunteer sampling bias by conservation stakeholder interests participating in the study. However, we suggest these results may also reflect the highly politicized process of marine conservation planning in the Kimberley where conservation efforts have recently emerged and galvanized to oppose a major offshore gas development and associated land-based infrastructure. Consistent with other participatory mapping studies, our results indicate that the chosen operational definition for stakeholder group such as group identity versus interests can influence participatory mapping outcomes, with implications for MPA designation and management. Future research is needed to better understand the strengths and limitations of participatory mapping that is framed in stakeholder perspectives, especially when sampling relies heavily on volunteer recruitment and participation methods that appear predisposed to participatory bias. In parallel, practical efforts to ensure that social research efforts such as this are included in MPA planning must remain of the highest priority for scientists and managers alike.}

Due to budget constraints public transportation (PT) can no longer be deployed in regions where it attracts insufficient customers. Novel techniques like demand-responsive collective transportation (DRT) are evaluated to cut costs. This requires detailed simulations that are able to predict travel demand and include trip execution. Simulating facilities acting as feeder services to time-table based PT services requires detailed and accurate information about the PT infrastructure on a network. However, there are no public data sources that combine network and PT infrastructure data with the preferred level of detail. A newly developed bus stop mapping technique is presented. It uses the OpenStreetMap (OSM) and General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) open data sources, which are maintained independently. Merging the data into a single database requires alignment. Developing bus stop mapping algorithms is challenging due to (i) inaccurate location data, (ii) inconsistent data sources and (iii) the vastly interconnected PT network and services. Due to the inaccuracy in the GTFS stop locations and in the OSM network, pure geometric considerations might lead to multiple candidate solutions to map a stop to the network. The new technique handles all GTFS trips at once and operates under the assumption that PT operators minimize the total distance driven to complete all trips.}

Researchers have developed various algorithms to detect the spatial layout of intersections based on sensor data such as high-definition images/videos, laser point cloud data, and GPS traces, which can recognize intersections and road segments; however, most approaches do not automatically generate Lane-based Intersection Maps (LIMs). The objective of our study is to generate LIMs automatically from crowdsourced big trace data using a multi-hierarchy feature extraction strategy. The LIM automatic generation method proposed in this paper consists of the initial recognition of road intersections, intersection layout detection, and lane-based intersection map-generation. The initial recognition process identifies intersection and non-intersection areas using spatial clustering algorithms based on the similarity of angle and distance. The intersection layout is composed of exit and entry points, obtained by combining trajectory integration algorithms and turn rules at road intersections. The LIM generation step is finally derived from the intersection layout detection results and lane-based road information, based on geometric matching algorithms. The effectiveness of our proposed LIM generation method is demonstrated using crowdsourced vehicle traces. Additional comparisons and analysis are also conducted to confirm recognition results. Experiments show that the proposed method saves time and facilitates LIM refinement from crowdsourced traces more efficiently than methods based on other types of sensor data.}

For this we use data collected from more than 8000 participants over a period of four months, in combination with freely available geographical information. We develop a support vectors machines-based model to infer five transport modes and achieve success rate of 94%. The developed model is applicable across different mobile sensed data, as it is independent on the integration of additional sensors in the device itself. Furthermore, suggested approach is robust, as it strongly relies on pre-processed data, which makes it applicable for big data implementations in (smart) cities and other data-driven mobility platforms.}

These differences require new paradigms for thinking about maps and their objectives generally, and for thinking more specifically about how information is represented and disseminated through cybercartography. In this chapter, the authors examine the nature of TK and the potential of cybercartography for its representation. The authors consider the role of law (defined as explicit and enforceable rules) and normativity (defined as ‘ought’ statements that guide social relations) in shaping relationships between cartographers and the contributors of TK.

This study investigates the motivations of individuals from five marine protected areas (MPAs) in the Dutch Caribbean to (not) participate in different initiatives around lionfish. Following an interpretive approach, semi-structured interviews with seventy-eight informants were conducted and analyzed using thematic network analysis. Approximately 60% (n = 48) of informants indicated that they had participated in citizen science initiatives at the outset of the invasion. From this group, almost half said that they still participated in some type of data collection, but only a few did so within a citizen science context. Many informants were initially motivated to participate in lionfish detection and response initiatives due to concern for the environment. Personal meanings attached to both the data collection experiences and to the data influenced informants’ motivations to sustain or cease data collection and/or sharing. In time, the view of lionfish as a threat changed for many informants as this species’ recreational and/or commercial value increased. Enabling and constraining factors for data collection and sharing were identified at the personal, interpersonal, organizational and technical levels. Our findings have implications for the design of future citizen science initiatives focused on invasive species.}

Geospatial Scientists aim to help in mitigating or managing such hazards by computational modeling of these complex events, while Information Communication Technology (ICT) supports the execution of various models addressing different aspects of disaster management. The execution of natural hazard models using traditional ICT foundations is not possible in a timely manner due to the complex nature of the models, the need for large-scale computational resources as well as intensive data and concurrent-access requirements. Cloud Computing can address these challenges with near-unlimited capacity for computation, storage, and networking, and the ability, to offer natural hazard modeling systems as end services, has now become more realistic than ever. However, researchers face several open challenges in adopting and utilizing Cloud Computing technologies during disasters. As such, this survey paper aggregates all these challenges, reflects on the current research trends and outlines a conceptual Cloud-based solution framework for more effective natural hazards modeling and management systems using Cloud infrastructure in conjunction with other technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT) networks, fog, and edge computing. We draw a clear picture of the current research state in the area and suggest further research directions for future systems.}

Each object shape is described qualitatively by its edges, angles, convexities, and lengths. LogC-QSD describes the shape of composed objects qualitatively adding circuits to describe the connections among the shapes. It also infers new angles and lengths using composition tables. Its main contributions are: (i) describing qualitatively the resulting boundary of connecting N shapes and (ii) its application to solve spatial reasoning tests. LogC-QSD approach has been implemented using Prolog programming language, which is based on Horn clauses and first order logic. The testing framework was SWI-Prolog on the LogC-QSD dataset. The obtained results show that the LogC-QSD approach was able to correctly answer all the questions in the LogC-QSD dataset, which involved compositions up to five shapes. The correct answer for 60% of the questions was obtained in an average time of 2.45·10-4 s by comparing the concavities and right angles of the final QSD composed shape with the possible answers. The rest of the questions required a matching algorithm and they were solved by LogC-QSD in an average time of 19.50·10-4 s. Analysis of the execution times obtained showed that the algorithmic cost of LogC-QSD is lower than O(n2) in the worst case.}

Besides, given the importance of mobile computing, these systems have evolved to consider also the dynamic context of the mobile users (location, time, weather conditions, etc.) to offer them more appropriate suggestions and information while on the move. In this paper, we provide an extensive survey of recent advances towards intelligent mobile Context-Aware Recommender Systems (mobile CARS) from an information management perspective, with an emphasis on mobile computing and AI techniques, along with an analysis of existing research gaps and future research directions. We focus on approaches that go beyond just considering the location of the user and exploit also other context information. In this study, we have identified that deep learning approaches are promising artificial intelligence models for mobile CARS. Additionally, in a near future, we expect a higher prominence of push-based recommendation solutions where at least part of the recommendation engine could be executed in the mobile devices, which could share data and tasks in a distributed way.}

In most of the cases, it seems that the prior experience and skills of the modelers had a dominant effect on the selection of the methods used.

Specifically, both several geo-temporal distance measures and a density-based geo-temporal clustering algorithm are proposed. The approach can be applied to social messages containing an explicit geographic and temporal location. The algorithm usage is exemplified to identify geographic regions where many geotagged Twitter messages about an event of interest have been created, possibly in the same time period in the case of non-periodic events (aperiodic events), or at regular timestamps in the case of periodic events. This allows discovering the spatio-temporal periodic and aperiodic characteristics of events occurring in specific geographic areas, and thus increasing the awareness of decision makers who are in charge of territorial planning. Several case studies are used to illustrate the proposed procedure.}

We have performed both empirical study and experimental analysis to demonstrate feasibility of our proposed approach.

During disasters and other disrupted settings, information spread through informal channels regularly outpaces official information provided by public officials and the press. Social scientists have long examined this kind of informal communication in the rumoring literature, but studying rumoring in disrupted settings has posed numerous methodological challenges. Measuring features of informal communication–timing, content, location–with any degree of precision has historically been extremely challenging in small studies and infeasible at large scales. We address this challenge by using online, informal communication from a popular microblogging website and for which we have precise spatial and temporal metadata. While the online environment provides a new means for observing rumoring, the abundance of data poses challenges for parsing hazard-related rumoring from countless other topics in numerous streams of communication. Rumoring about disaster events is typically temporally and spatially constrained to places where that event is salient. Accordingly, we use spatio and temporal subsampling to increase the resolution of our detection techniques. By filtering out data from known sources of error (per rumor theories), we greatly enhance the signal of disaster-related rumoring activity. We use these spatio-temporal filtering techniques to detect rumoring during a variety of disaster events, from high-casualty events in major population centers to minimally destructive events in remote areas. We consistently find three phases of response: anticipatory excitation where warnings and alerts are issued ahead of an event, primary excitation in and around the impacted area, and secondary excitation which frequently brings a convergence of attention from distant locales onto locations impacted by the event. Our results demonstrate the promise of spatio-temporal filtering techniques for “tuning” measurement of hazard-related rumoring to enable observation of rumoring at scales that have long been infeasible.}

Geographical citizen science-based sighting data, collected from a commercial whale-watch platform during the 2007–2010 migration seasons, were used to examine variations in bay usage and pod composition. Differences in the distribution patterns of mother-calf and non-calf pod sightings were examined using spatial cluster analysis. The impact of sampling bias, introduced through non-specialist volunteer collected data, on spatial cluster detection was simulated. Observation error and spatial sampling bias may affect local spatial cluster detection. Sampling processes with potential to contribute to this bias should be recorded in the survey design of geographical citizen science based data collection programmes. Mother-calf pods showed a significant preference for the shallow waters of Jervis Bay during October and November, indicating the bay may function as a preferred resting location during their southern migration with important marine management implications.}

In this chapter, we discuss the ways in which geospatial reasoning has been applied to open data. We define geospatial reasoning as both reasoning about the location of objects on the earth (e.g., relating to inference of spatial relationships) and reasoning about geospatial data (e.g., relating to the attributes of data that is geospatial in nature). We then present two case studies to illustrate the use of geospatial reasoning with open data: (1) the use of fuzzy reasoning for map buffering and (2) methods for automatically learning nonclassical ontologies from geospatial data (data driven ontologies).}

Using this framework, we then score thirty-one existing collaborative geospatial tools and apply a cluster analysis to create a typology of these tools. We present this typology as a map of the emergent ecosystem and functional niches of collaborative geospatial tools. We identify three primary clusters of tools composed of eight secondary clusters across which divergence is driven by required infrastructure and user involvement. Overall, our results highlight how environmental collaborations have benefitted from the use of these tools and propose key areas of future tool development for continued support of collaborative geospatial efforts.}

abstract = {Factors associated with cycle safety, including international differences in injury and mortality rates, protective equipment and bicycle training, have been subject to increasing academic interest. Environmental variables associated with cycle safety have also been scrutinised, but few studies have focussed on geographical factors at the local level. This paper addresses this research gap by analysing a geo-referenced dataset of road traffic incidents, taken from the UK’s STATS19 dataset (2005–2012). We investigate incidents involving cyclists within West Yorkshire. This is an interesting case study area as it has an historically low cycling rate but very ambitions cycling plans following investment from the Department of Transport. West Yorkshire is found to be an unusually risky area for cyclists, with an estimated 53 deaths and 1372 serious injuries per billion kilometres cycled, based on census commuting statistics. This is roughly double the national average. This riskiness varies spatially and temporally, broadly in line with expectations from the previous literature. An unexpected result was that cycling seems to be disproportionately risky for young people in West Yorkshire compared with young people nationally. The case study raises the issue of potential negative health impacts of promoting cycling amongst vulnerable groups in dangerous areas. We conclude by highlighting opportunities for increasing cycling uptake via measures designed primarily to improve safety. The analysis underlying this research is reproducible, based on code stored at github.com/Robinlovelace/bikeR.}

To date, there has been no systematic evaluation of the extent to which mixed methods in participatory mapping yield valid results when applied to the same research setting and research questions. A mixed methods research design (combined exploratory sequential and convergent parallel) was implemented in a large research project to identify marine and coastal values in the Kimberley region of Australia. Qualitative interviews (n = 167) were completed with stakeholders to identify place-based values using polygon mapping methods and internet-based public participation GIS (PPGIS) methods (n = 578). We defined and operationalized the concepts of concurrent, commensurate, and convergent validity to assess mixed methods research outcomes. We found that qualitative and quantitative methods resulted in moderate to high concurrent validity when assessing the importance of place values in the study area. Convergent validity (spatial) was highly variable by place value, with stronger convergent validity found with mapped aesthetic, recreational fishing, tourism, biodiversity, and Aboriginal culture values, and weakest with existence, therapeutic, and commercial fishing values. Convergent validity was influenced by weak commensurate validity through the use of different geometric features (polygons versus points) for mapping values across a large study area. The utility of mixed methods for planning decision support in a convergent parallel design depends on demonstrating convergence in construct meaning, spatial location, and consistency in values in the sampling populations.}

Our purpose is to conduct a comprehensive and objective research into how the public use of Big Data from web searches has affected research, and furthermore, to discuss the implications of Google Trends in terms of Big Data utilization and application. To this end, we conducted a network analysis on 657 research papers that used Google Trends. We also identified the important nodes of the networks and reviewed the research directions of representative papers. The study reveals that Google Trends is used to analyze various variables in a wide range of areas, including IT, communications, medicine, health, business and economics. In addition, this study shows that research using Google Trends has increased dramatically in the last decade, and in the process, the focus of research has shifted to forecasting changes, whereas in the past the focus had been on merely describing and diagnosing research trends, such as surveillance and monitoring. This study also demonstrates that in recent years, there has been an expansion in analysis in linkage with other social Big Data sources, as researchers attempt to overcome the limitations of using only search information. Our study will provide various insights for researchers who utilize Google Trends as well as researchers who rely on various other sources of Big Data in their efforts to compare research trends and identify new areas for research.}

An alternative approach uses participating mapping methods. This study sought to validate and expand on previous participatory mapping research methods and findings and address spatial scaling by applying these methods to a large urban park system. Key challenges for spatial scaling included ambiguity in park classification and achieving representative sampling for larger and spatially-disbursed urban residents. We designed an internet-based public participation GIS (PPGIS) survey and used household and volunteer sampling to identify the type and locations of urban park benefits. Study participants (n = 816) identified locations of physical activities and other urban park benefits (psychological, social, and environmental) which were analyzed by park type. Consistent with previous suburb-scale research, we found significant associations between urban park type and different urban park benefits. Linear parks were significantly associated with higher intensity physical activities; natural parks were associated with environmental benefits; and community parks were associated with benefits from social interaction. Neighborhood parks emerged as significantly associated with psychological benefits. The diversity of park activities and benefits were positively correlated with park size. Distance analysis confirmed that physical benefits of parks were closest to participant domicile, while social and environmental benefits were more distant. These results validate previous suburb-scale findings despite greater variability in park types and sample populations. Future urban park research using participatory mapping would benefit from greater effort to obtain participation from under-represented populations that can induce nonresponse bias, and analyses to determine whether system-wide results can be disaggregated by suburb or neighborhood to address social inequities in urban park benefits.}

abstract = {Geographic information retrieval (GIR) is nowadays a hot research issue that involves the management of uncertainty and imprecision and the modeling of user preferences and context. Indexing the geographic content of documents implies dealing with the ambiguity, synonymy and homonymy of geographic names in texts. On the other side, the evaluation of queries specifying both content based conditions and spatial conditions on documents’ contents requires representing the vagueness and context dependency of spatial conditions and the personal user's preferences. The spatial condition can be specified linguistically in the query through vague terms such as “close to the North East of Milan’’, whose semantic depends on the user's context and perception of distance. Further, users may want to express queries in which the content condition and the spatial condition have a distinct preference and are combined with a distinct semantics. In this paper, we propose a geographic information retrieval model and a system implementing it that represents both the uncertainty in indexing the geographic documents’ content and the user's context and preferences in evaluating flexible spatial queries. It extracts the geographic content from documents’ text by applying heuristic knowledge coded by bipolar rules which evaluate positive hints and negative hints for the recognition of geographic names in text. Thus, it represents the geographic content of documents by fuzzy footprints, i.e., distinct locations on the earth associated with the text with a distinct degree of significance. Finally, the system allows evaluating two types of queries flexibly combining the content based condition with the spatial condition. The spatial condition is interpreted as the soft constraint “close’’ on the user's perceived distance between the documents’ footprint and query's footprint. For each retrieved document, two relevance scores are computed with respect to the two query conditions that are flexibly combined to generate an overall ranked list of documents. The user can choose the semantic for the combination that can be either an asymmetric “and possibly’’ aggregation between the mandatory content condition and the optional spatial condition, or a compensative “average’’ aggregation, defined as a linear combination of the two conditions; further, a relative preference between the conditions can be specified to achieve personalization and effectiveness. A prototypal geographic information retrieval system, named Geo-Finder, based on this model is described, and its evaluations are discussed.}

I analyze the profound changes that have occurred in contemporary cartographic production, especially those investing the role of the interpreter and those related to the unprecedented social needs that maps are called upon to address. First I will consider the outcomes that Information Technology (IT) has had on mapping in promoting a wide range of new production sites and new professional profiles for cartographers. Then I will survey the social landscape that shows cartography’s involvement in the practices of democratization, both within governance policies or territorial planning and in terms of citizen access to data from public institutions. Finally, I will discuss the issue of participation in the collection of cartographic data and propose a model, pioneered in the field of environmental protection in Africa. I will present a methodology, called SIGAP (Geographic Information Systems for Protected Areas), which takes charge of the entire process of cartographic construction and produces participatory tools based on the use of geographic information systems (GIS). That will lead us to reflect on the semantic consequences of the availability of GIS tools online and, more specifically, to consider interactivity as a participatory potential for web-based cartography. This chapter will therefore provide a reflection on the importance of method for retrieving cartographic data; on the vital role of participation in the construction of maps; and on the potential WebGIS offer to promote such participation. These are essential conditions for rendering landscape in modes that pave the way to a chorography.∗}

In order to manage and query existing indoor spatial models, we rely on the power of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and spatial databases. Moreover, to extract symbolic information from the environment, we have developed a door detection system that fuses 2D laser and vision data. We have integrated these two ideas into an extended Kalman filter localization framework. Our proposal has been implemented and tested through autonomous navigation missions in real-world scenarios. Extensive experimental results are provided, which show robustness and accuracy concerning both door detection and localization.}

This paper presents a new approach for novel sketch map understanding. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive work dealing with this task in an offline way. This paper presents a system for automatic understanding of sketch maps and the underlying algorithms for all steps. Major parts are a region-growing segmentation for sketch map objects, a classification for isolated objects, and a context-aware classification. The context-aware classification uses probabilistic relaxation labeling to integrate dependencies between objects into the recognition. We show how these algorithms can deal with the major problems of sketch map understanding, such as vagueness in interpretation. Our experiments demonstrate the importance of context-aware classification for sketch map understanding. In addition, a new database of annotated sketch maps was developed and is made publicly available. This can be used for training and evaluation of sketch map understanding algorithms.}

Natural environments are known to contribute to human wellbeing, although to date research has largely focused on quantifiable benefits. The less tangible benefits obtained from ecosystems have commonly been referred to as ‘Cultural Ecosystem Services’ (CES). However, challenges persist around the definition and measurement of CES. A qualitative review of literature was conducted to identify key characteristics of CES, challenges to CES research, and lessons for the future of UGS research. The review found that CES have tended to be characterised by intangibility and incommensurability, when perhaps the most distinguishing features are the form and extent of human-environment co-production, and association between CES and held values. Despite ongoing challenges, researchers have applied a range of methods to capture and analyse CES, including non-economic and participatory/deliberative approaches. As urbanisation increases, it is important to understand how CES from UGS affect wellbeing. The review found that attention to date has mainly focused on identifying CES but scope exists to research the effects of UGS attributes, and how the socio-cultural diversity of cities might influence co-production of CES.}

abstract = {Despite highly specialised and capable emergency management systems, ordinary citizens are usually first on the scene in an emergency or disaster, and remain long after official services have ceased. Citizens often play vital roles in helping those affected to respond and recover, and can provide invaluable assistance to official agencies. However, in most developed countries, emergency and disaster management relies largely on a workforce of professionals and, to varying degrees, volunteers affiliated with official agencies. Those who work outside of such systems have tended to be viewed as a nuisance or liability, and their efforts are often undervalued. Given increasing disaster risk worldwide due to population growth, urban development and climate change, it is likely that ‘informal’ volunteers will provide much of the additional surge capacity required to respond to more frequent emergencies and disasters in the future. This paper considers the role of informal volunteers in emergency and disaster management. Definitions of volunteerism are reviewed and it is argued that there is an overemphasis on volunteering within, and for, state and formal organisations. We offer a broader definition of ‘informal volunteerism’ that recognises the many ways ordinary citizens volunteer their time, knowledge, skills and resources to help others in times of crisis. Two broad types of informal volunteerism are identified – emergent and extending – and the implications for emergency and disaster management are considered. Particular attention is given to increasing ‘digital volunteerism’ due to the greater accessibility of sophisticated but simple information and communication technologies. Culture and legal liability are identified as key barriers to greater participation of informal volunteers. We argue that more adaptive and inclusive models of emergency and disaster management are needed to harness the capacities and resilience that exist within and across communities.}

To address the risk of bushfire, policies and practices have promoted and encouraged landowner responsibility for bushfire mitigation actions and behaviours. Using a postal survey, interviews and focus groups, we examine perceptions and actions regarding bushfire preparedness from the viewpoints of individual residents, landowners, and the local fire and environmental authorities on the Lower Eyre Peninsula of South Australia. Respondents living on larger sized allotments were more likely to perceive that their property was vulnerable to bushfire than those living on residential-sized allotments. Larger holdings tend to have more fire-susceptible vegetation than the smaller properties located in fringe suburbs, which seems to confer to those latter residents a sense of greater safety from bushfires. On the other hand, residents on larger blocks reported higher levels of bushfire management knowledge and expressed stronger connections to the place where they live, which influenced their willingness to work to mitigate bushfire risk. Importantly, there is a disconnection between such individual landholder preparedness for bushfire and that of the broader community. Individual actions often do not translate into collective responses, suggesting that a greater sense of shared responsibility will need to develop to enable effective mitigation of regional bushfire risk at a regional scale.}

We describe the language and national distribution of the messages, the relative volume of different types of communications, and the factors that determine the adoption and use of social media by the candidates. We also analyze the dynamics of the volume and content of the communications over the duration of the campaign with reference to both the EU integration dimension of the debate and the prominence of the most visible list-leading candidates. Our findings indicate that the lead candidates and their televised debate had a prominent influence on the volume and content of communications, and that the content and emotional tone of communications more reflects preferences along the EU dimension of political contestation rather than classic national issues relating to left-right differences.}

In this paper, we focus on the 2014–2015 Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic in West Africa, which saw the widespread use of public and commercial satellite-derived data, to investigate how overhead orbital and close-up viewpoints enabled by satellites are shaping attitudes to disease and determining responses to infectious threats. We argue that high-resolution satellite imagery is acting as a spur to a new spatio-temporal targeting of disease that parallels the ever more vertical dimension of contemporary warfare. At the same time, this new visualization of disease is promoting a broader ecological perspective on pathogen emergence. How can these divergent perspectives be reconciled? In addressing this question, we analyze the different uses to which satellite imagery has been put in tracking and mapping Ebola ‘hotspots’ across Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. We also consider the institutional contexts that have enabled the acquisition of this imagery. Given the rapid integration of space technologies in epidemiology and health logistics, there is now a need to examine how and with what consequences remote-sensing and communication technologies may be reconfiguring the practices and scope of global health.}

abstract = {The vastly increasing number of online hotel room bookings is not only intensifying the competition in the travel industry as a whole, but also prompts travel intermediates (i.e. e-companies that aggregate information about different travel products from different travel suppliers) into a fierce competition for the best prices of travel products, i.e. hotel rooms. An important factor that affects revenues is the ability to conclude profitable deals with different travel suppliers. However, the profitability of a contract not only depends on the communication skills of a contract manager. It significantly depends on the objective information obtained about a specific travel supplier and his/her products. While the contract manager usually has a broad knowledge of the travel business in general, collecting and processing specific information about travel suppliers is usually a time and cost expensive task. Our goal is to develop a tool that assists the travel intermediate to acquire the missing strategic information about individual hotels in order to leverage profitable deals. We present a GIS-based decision support system that can both, estimate objective hotel room rates using essential hotel and locational characteristics and predict temporal room rate prices. Information about objective hotel room rates allows for an objective comparison and provides the basis for a realistic computation of the contract's profitability. The temporal prediction of room rates can be used for monitoring past hotel room rates and for adjusting the price of the future contract. This paper makes three major contributions. First, we present a GIS-based decision support system, the first of its kind, for hotel brokers. Second, the DSS can be applied to virtually any part of the world, which makes it a very attractive business tool in real-life situations. Third, it integrates a widely used data mining framework that provides access to dozens of ready to run algorithms to be used by a domain expert and it offers the possibility of adding new algorithms once they are developed. The system has been designed and evaluated in close cooperation with a company that develops travel technology solutions, in particular inventory management and pricing solutions for many well-known websites and travel agencies around the world. This company has also provided us with real, large datasets to evaluate the system. We demonstrate the functionality of the DSS using the hotel data in the area of Barcelona, Spain. The results indicate the potential usefulness of the proposed system.}

This chapter provides an introduction to the role of snow and ice in the hydrosphere by discussing topics including snowpack characteristics, snow observation approaches, the energy balance of snow-covered areas, and modeling of snowmelt. Furthermore, the role of glaciers and glacial mass balances, including modeling glacier discharge, is discussed.

Key to preparation is the recognition that things can and will go awry, necessitating prior consideration of “what if?,” and the formulation of alternative, fallback plans, and “safety nets.” Temporal and spatial scales are fundamental considerations, and proper preparation should result in fieldwork projects that are both meaningful and manageable as components of broader geomorphic research. Important considerations include those revolving around personnel selection and management, equipment needs, institutional and personal support systems, safety, health and fitness, emergency planning, finances, authorization, transportation, accommodation, and prior understanding of and adjustment to both the physical and human environments in which fieldwork occurs.}

By developing the toolkit we seek to contribute not only to the literature about space-time accessibility analysis and activity-based travel demand analysis but also to the dissemination of time geographical concepts to wider audiences. To achieve the latter, we have implemented the toolkit as a stand-alone application that is independent of commercial software and the platform used. Query results can easily be exported to Google™ Earth/Maps as well as conventional GIS software. As an illustrative example, a representative day-to-day rendezvous scenario was set up to demonstrate how meeting possibilities are shaped by various individual spatial and temporal constraints.}

In this paper, I draw on past experience to identify and illustrate the potential for “spatial statistical thinking”, that is, the development of a spatial statistical intuition. Several examples illustrate the potential for a more explicit development of such intuition drawing simultaneously from both spatial analysis and statistics. As a step in this direction, I stress the importance of maintaining a spatial conceptual framework in the application and interpretation of spatial statistical methods, i.e., the importance of spatial interpretation of spatial statistics.}

abstract = {In recent years, advanced geospatial technologies have been playing an increasingly important role in supporting critical decision makings in disaster response. One rising challenge to effectively use the growing volume of geospatial data sets is to rapidly process the data and to extract useful information. Unprocessed data are intangible and non-consumable, and often create the so-called “data-rich-but-information-poor” situation. To address this issue, this study proposed a Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) based information salience framework to prioritize the sequence of the information processing tasks. The proposed model integrates the DEA efficiency score with a linguistic group decision process. For the input variables, computational complexity and intensity are selected to measure the difficulty in information processing. For the outputs, the performance of each processing tasks is evaluated based on the experts’ judgment on how the processing tasks satisfy the needs of decision makers. These needs are characterized by four classic disaster functions. A unique element of our proposed framework is that cone constraints are added to the DEA model based on the experts’ evaluation of the importance of the four disaster functions to model the dynamic information need. The proposed model was validated with a Hurricane Sandy based case study. The results indicate that the proposed framework is capable of prioritizing geospatial data processing tasks in a systematic manner and accelerating information extraction from disaster related geospatial data sets.}

However, scientifically organizing these ICTs toward improving geoscience measurements, data processing, and information services has encountered tremendous challenges. This paper reviews a profound revolution in geoscience that has resulted from the Geospatial Sensor Web (GSW), serving as a new cyber-physical spatio-temporal information infrastructure for geoscience on the World Wide Web (WWW). In contrast to previous experiment-based and sensor-based paradigms, the GSW-based paradigm is able to accomplish the following: (1) achieve integrated and sharable management of diverse sensing resources, (2) obtain real-time or near real-time and spatiotemporal continuous data, (3) conduct interoperable and online geoscience data processing and analysis, and (4) provide focusing services with web-based geoscience information and knowledge. As a benefit of the GSW, increasingly more geoscience disciplines are enjoying the value of real-time data, multi-source monitoring, online processing, and intelligence services. This paper reviews the evolution of geoscience research paradigm to demonstrate the scientific background of GSW. Then, we elaborates on four key methods provided by GSW, namely, integrated management, collaborative observation, scalable processing and fusion, and focusing service web capacity. Furthermore, current GSW prototypes and applications for environmental, hydrological, and natural disaster analysis are also reviewed. Moreover, four challenges to the future GSW in geoscience research are identified and analyzed, including integration with the Model Web initiative for sophisticated geo-processing, integration with humans for pervasive sensing, integration with Internet of Things (IoT) to achieve high-quality performance and data mining, and integration with Artificial Intelligence (AI) to provide smart geoservices. We have concluded that GSW has become an indispensable cyber-physical infrastructure, and will play a greater role in geoscience research and application.}

Such work looks at the processes and discrete moments in development that led to certain knowledges being represented and other knowledges remaining invisible. In this paper I build on these conversations by exploring the knowledge politics of digital humanitarianism. Digital humanitarianism, a technological corollary to the geoweb, is the set of social and institutional networks, technologies, and practices that enable large numbers of remote and on-the-ground individuals to collaborate on humanitarian projects. Specifically, in this paper I offer 4 “moments of closure” when knowledge politics have been negotiated, enacted, and made durable in digital humanitarianism. These moments of closure constellate around the themes of inclusion, categorization, accuracy, and visibility. I then consider the implications of these moments for the kinds of epistemologies digital humanitarianism espouses, and how knowledges come to be represented. I argue that these knowledge politics – the struggles for legitimacy and means of representation – are fluid and contested, yet become more stable when implemented through technology. Through these processes digital humanitarianism, and by extension the geoweb, embodies the social relations that first produced the debates around knowledge representation.}

Resource allocation in transit-based emergency evacuation is studied in this paper. The goal is to find a method for allocation of resources to communities in an evacuation process which is (1) fair, (2) reasonably efficient, and (3) able to dynamically adapt to the changes to the emergency situation. Four variations of the resource allocation problem, namely maximum rate, minimum clearance time, maximum social welfare, and proportional fair resource allocation, are modeled and compared. It is shown that the optimal answer to each problem can be found efficiently. Additionally, a distributed and dynamic algorithm based on the Lagrangian dual approach, called PFD2A, is developed to find the proportional fair allocation of resources. Numerical results for a sample scenario are presented.}

We position open data at a crossroads, with significant concerns of the conflicting motivations driving open data, the shifting role of government as a service provider, and the fragile nature of open data within the government space. We emphasize that the future of open data will be driven by the negotiation of the ethical-economic tension that exists between provisioning governments, citizens, and private sector data users.}

This paper has three main objectives. The first is to provide a clear empirical case study of how race remains relevant to the way people use (or do not use) the internet and internet based services. The second is highlighting the power of new online and interactive mapping technologies and demonstrating how these technologies are differentially adopted. The third and final objective is illustrating how any divide in accessing digital technology is not simply a one time event but a constantly moving target as new devices, software and cultural practices emerge. Thus, in addition to highlighting the racial inequalities in US society in general, Hurricane Katrina provides an important window on the way in which race remains a key factor in the access and use of emerging digital technologies.}

PPGIS was implemented using both an internet application and with hardcopy maps in the field. Our research addressed two fundamental questions for park planning: (1) What is the spatial distribution of visitor activities and location-specific reasons for riding; and (2) What location-specific actions are needed to improve riding experiences? The spatial distributions of riding activities generated in PPGIS showed strong correlation with the GPS tracking results, with riding locations being related to the reasons for track selection. Riders proposed a broad range of management actions to improve riding experiences. PPGIS mapping provides a cost-effective approach to facilitate spatial decision making, allowing park agencies to prioritise future visitor management actions. We discuss the strengths and limitations of these research methods.}

However, such concepts are often referred to by humans and used in various forms of spatial analysis. Hence, the value and usability of topographic databases can greatly be improved by methods that automatically create such higher order phenomena through cartographic pattern recognition techniques, departing from the very detailed, geometry-oriented representations of topographic databases. As many higher order phenomena are only vaguely defined, this paper develops and evaluates a methodology to acquire definitional knowledge about geographic phenomena by participant experiments and use this knowledge to drive the cartographic pattern recognition process. The method is applied to acquire knowledge about British city centres and delineate referents of city centre from topographic data. City centres produced for ten British cities are compared to areas derived from alternative sources. F1-scores between 0.45 and 0.88 are achieved, suggesting that the delineation produced plausible city centre areas. The benefits of our work are better (and user-driven) descriptions of complex geographic phenomena that can form the basis for accurately enriching topographic databases with additional semantics, thus yielding added value for the data producer and the end user.}

However, mapping urban expansion globally is challenging: urban areas have a small footprint compared to other land cover types, their features are small, they are heterogeneous in both material composition and configuration, and the form and rates of new development are often highly variable across locations. Here we demonstrate a methodology for monitoring urban land expansion at continental to global scales using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. The new method focuses on resolving the spectral and temporal ambiguities between urban/non-urban land and stable/changed areas by: (1) spatially constraining the study extent to known locations of urban land; (2) integrating multi-temporal data from multiple satellite data sources to classify c. 2010 urban extent; and (3) mapping newly built areas (2000–2010) within the 2010 urban land extent using a multi-temporal composite change detection approach based on MODIS 250m annual maximum enhanced vegetation index (EVI). We test the method in 15 countries in East–Southeast Asia experiencing different rates and manifestations of urban expansion. A two-tiered accuracy assessment shows that the approach characterizes urban change across a variety of socioeconomic/political and ecological/climatic conditions with good accuracy (70–91% overall accuracy by country, 69–89% by biome). The 250m EVI data not only improve the classification results, but are capable of distinguishing between change and no-change areas in urban areas. Over 80% of the error in the change detection can be related to definitional issues or error propagation, rather than algorithm error. As such, these methods hold great potential for routine monitoring of urban change, as well as for providing a consistent and up-to-date dataset on urban extent and expansion for a rapidly evolving region.}

In this paper I discuss the prospects and problems of Geospatial Big Data (GBD) – broadly defined as data sets with locational information that exceed the capacity of widely available hardware, software, and/or human resources. While the datasets we create today remain within available resources, we nonetheless face the same challenges as many other fields that use and create GBD, especially in apprehensions over data quality and privacy. After reviewing the kinds of archaeological geospatial data currently available I discuss the near future of GBD in writing culture histories, making decisions, and visualizing the past. I use a case study from New Zealand to argue for the value of taking a data quantity-in-use approach to GBD and requiring applications of GBD in archaeology be regularly accompanied by a Standalone Quality Report.}

We study an arc routing problem that aims to regain the connectivity of the road network components by clearing a subset of the blocked roads. In this problem, we maximize the total prize gained by reconnecting disconnected network components within a specified time limit. The solution should determine the coordinated routes of each work troop starting at a depot node such that none of the closed roads can be traversed unless their unblocking/clearing procedure is finished. We develop an exact Mixed Integer Program (MIP) and a matheuristic method. The matheuristic solves single vehicle problems sequentially with updated prizes. To obtain an upper bound, we first relax the timing elements in the exact formulation and then solve its relaxed MIP, which decomposes into single vehicle problems, by Lagrangian Relaxation. We show the effectiveness of the proposed methods computationally on both random Euclidean and Istanbul road network data generated with respect to predicted earthquake scenarios.}

Initiatives such as the Building Information Model (BIM), Industry Founda- tion Classes (IFC), and CityGML are creating the information-theoretic backbone that guides the crucial aspects of quality, exchange, and interoperability of spatial data at the environmental and urban scale. However, due to the inherent scale, com- plexity, and detailed geometric character of building information data, extracting useful semantic and qualitative knowledge for accomplishing high-level analytical tasks is still an extremely complex and error prone process involving data intensive computing. We propose a uniform spatial data access middleware that can provide a combination of high-level, multi-modal, semantic, and quantitative-qualitative spatial data access and analytical capability. We present the core computational capabil- ities for the proposed middleware and present an overview of the high-level spatial model and its compliance with the industry standard IFC. A key theoretical contribution is a framework for investigating the computational complexity of deriving spatial artefacts within the context of building informatics. Additionally, we empirically investigate the feasibility and practicality of the derivation of spatial artefacts by conducting experiments on seven industry-scale IFC models. The experiment results show that, despite having non-linear polynomial increase with respect to time, deriving spatial artefacts is practical with large designs.}

abstract = {Accuracy is an integral component in consumption of land cover and change information. Accuracy characterization in change categorization is more complicated than that in single-date classifications, especially when pursued at a local or per-pixel basis. In this paper, reference sample data consisting of reference class labels at sample locations are referred to as (model) training and validation sample data, respectively, when they are used for building and testing predictive models of local accuracy. They are preferably collocated to verify land cover and change types at the same locations across multiple single-date classifications. With collocated training data, methods devised for local accuracy mapping were usually implemented as direct extensions to those designed for accuracy predictions in single-date land cover maps, given that both response and explanatory variables are defined properly based on change maps. However, alternative methods are required when collocated training sample data are unavailable or sparse but non-collocated data collected at sample units not aligned across time exist or can be made available more conveniently and flexibly. This is typically the case for change-classification accuracy analyses, whereby prior sampling design and sample data may not remain informative in time but can be made adaptive by restructuring and augmentation to better represent strata of transitions as well as persistence. Such adaptability leads to great cost-saving in sampling than undertaking collocated sampling anew each time performing or revising accuracy mapping for a specific change analysis over a particular period. With a coherent review of related research, this paper proposes a geostatistical method for predictive mapping of local accuracies in any land-cover change maps created properly through adaptive use of complexly configured training sample data. This method works on a functional relation between accuracies in change-categorization and single-date classifications whereby temporal correlation (cross-correlation) between bi-temporal classification correctness is accommodated. In this cross-correlation-adjusted product method (named PXCOV), quantification of single-date classification accuracies is based on logistic regression. Cross-correlation is estimated via cross-validation cokriging through exploiting a useful relation between traditional and pseudo cross-variograms in the absence of collocated sample data or calculated more easily on the basis of collocated sample data if available. Studies were undertaken to test this method and compare it with direct logistic-regression-kriging (named LogRK direct), its simpler version, direct logistic regression without kriging (named LogR direct), and the baseline product method (named Product, being a simpler option of PXCOV without accounting for cross-correlation), using GlobeLand30 2000 and 2010 land cover at five sites in China. For each site, eleven training samples of equal sizes but differing configurations and one independent validation sample were collected. Logistic regression was performed on map class occurrence pattern indices quantified in size-optimized moving windows for mapping local accuracies in single-date classifications (as necessary intermediate steps in Product and PXCOV) and bi-temporal change-categorization (LogR direct and LogRK direct). In LogRK direct, geostatistical modeling and kriging were based on standardized residuals after logistic regression (based on change maps directly). In PXCOV, cross-correlation between single-date classification correctness was estimated and accounted for properly, with their non-stationarity in change vs. no-change strata of sample pixels accommodated, after estimating aforementioned single-date local accuracies. Statistical testing of relative performances of alternative methods was undertaken based on validation samples for individual study sites. It was confirmed that the proposed method PXCOV is more accurate than LogR direct and LogRK direct when there are relatively few collocated sample pixels (i.e., the typical scenarios justifying use of PXCOV). PXCOV is generally more accurate than Product and should be pursued when enough collocated data are available for estimating cross-correlation, although Product is sometimes adequate for practical purposes. LogR direct is recommended over LogRK direct because collocated sample data are often sparse due to low sampling intensities as in large-area applications. Therefore, as a method complementing LogR direct and similar methods, PXCOV facilitates adaptive use of training sample data of complex configurations for increased accuracy and efficiency in predictive mapping of local change-categorization accuracies.}
