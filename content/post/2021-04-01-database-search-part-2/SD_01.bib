abstract = {Cultural ecosystem services (CES) are some of the most valuable contributions of ecosystems to human well-being. Nevertheless, these services are often underrepresented in ecosystem service assessments. Defining CES for the purposes of spatial quantification has been challenging because it has been difficult to spatially model CES. However, rapid increases in mobile network connectivity and the use of social media have generated huge amounts of crowdsourced data. This offers an opportunity to define and spatially quantify CES. We inventoried established CES conceptualisations and sources of crowdsourced data to propose a CES definition and typology for spatial quantification. Furthermore, we present the results of three spatial models employing crowdsourced data to measure CES on Texel, a coastal island in the Netherlands. Defining CES as information-flows best enables service quantification. A general typology of eight services is proposed. The spatial models produced distributions consistent with known areas of cultural importance on Texel. However, user representativeness and measurement uncertainties affect our results. Ethical considerations must also be taken into account. Still, crowdsourced data is a valuable source of information to define and model CES due to the level of detail available. This can encourage the representation of CES in ecosystem service assessments.}

In this study, we aimed to develop an effective method to assess the credibility of VGI for time-critical conditions, such as disaster response. We collected datasets from two extreme flood events in 2011 and 2013 from Brisbane, Australia. According to the defined geo-location factors, we built a binary logistic regression with the 2011 event dataset to measure the credibility scores of the VGI instances. At the threshold of 0.917, the overall accuracy of the model in the 2011 training dataset was 90.5%. Next, the performance of this probability model was evaluated by the 2013 testing instances. We found that our model could categorize the credibility classes with 80.4% accuracy. These results suggest great potential for our model to be used by emergency management sectors to sort credibility of VGI for efficient and rapid response, decision-making, and coordination.}

These contributions may be qualitative or quantitative observations and include multimedia content such as videos and photos. With this new data source, new spatial patterns maybe revealed that previously went unnoticed. Specific issues associated to VGI that are particularly interesting to human geographers relate to volunteer's motivation, accuracy, precision, and reliability of the data, questions about whether the data are contributed by a local expert or a remote user, ethical considerations related to data ownership and views that may be privileged over others on new maps generated with VGI.}

As socially constructed data, health VGI reflect the people who perceive issues and choose to report them, and the digital systems that structure the reporting process. We propose a conceptual framework that describes the interlocking effects of socioeconomic, behavioral, geographic, and technological processes on VGI accuracy and credibility. GIS and statistical methods are used to analyze social and geographical biases in health-related VGI through a case study of bed bug complaint data from New York City's 311 system. Reports of bed bug infestation from 311 are mapped and modeled to uncover associations with socioeconomic and built environment characteristics. Factors associated with bed bug report credibility are examined by comparing characteristics of confirmed reports with those for reports in which inspectors found no evidence of infestation (negative reports). A multilevel model of credibility incorporating report-, building-, and tract-level variables reveals strong geographical and socioeconomic biases, with negative reports generated more frequently from high-value residential buildings located in high-income neighborhoods with predominately white, non-Hispanic populations. Using 311 data for all bed bug reports, rather than confirmed reports, obscures the burden of these pests in high poverty neighborhoods and diminishes socioeconomic disparities. Mistaken reporting also has economic costs, as each report triggers an inspection by city inspectors that entails time, monetary, and opportunity costs.}

However, newly available data sources promise extended possibilities for the investigation and understanding of the underlying factors. We validate the rationale for using both opportunistically available crowd-sourced data (i.e., volunteered geographic information or VGI) as well as more established but rarely investigated authoritative data as predictors of subjective cycling risk. We achieve this by correlating indicators of cycling risk extracted from both VGI and authoritative data for two different German cities with participants’ risk estimates assessed in laboratory-based virtual reality experiments. In Case 1, 15 participants (mostly undergraduate students with a mean age of 22 years old; nine of them females) were tested as a sample representing frequent and experienced cyclists, but unfamiliar with the 19 tested locations and less likely to be affected by the virtual reality setup. In Case 2, 24 new participants (mostly undergraduate students; mean age 24 years; 13 of them females) were experienced cyclists and mostly familiar with the 40 test locations located in their city of residence. For both cases, our findings provide evidence that parameters extracted from VGI (e.g., the semantic severity of the contribution and the reception by other citizens) as well as from authoritative data sources (e.g., accident statistics or Space Syntax measures) represent valid indicators for the subjectively perceived risk of cycling at a specific location. On the basis of this validation, future research can use these data sources to investigate the sources of risk perception during urban cycling in greater detail.}

Such an approach has significant advantages but requires access to relatively detailed spatial data. In the absence of official data concerning resources, researchers may benefit from employing increasingly available volunteered geographic information (VGI) as a central source of data or to complement more traditional data sources. This paper describes the development of a map of forest recreational resources in Ireland by combining conventional forest cover data and VGI of recreational trails. As an extension the new map is combined with household survey data to explore respondent's ability to identify local recreational forests and models the impact of the characteristics of the closest forest on their annual visitation. The results suggest that VGI can be a useful resource to researchers in both the identification and characterisation of recreational resources. In addition, this paper finds that the distance to and characteristics of the nearest recreational forest has a significant impact on total annual visitation by members of the public.}

Recently researchers’ attention has focused on using crowds of volunteers to help map the damaged infrastructure and devastation caused by natural disasters, such as those in Haiti and Pakistan. This data is extremely useful, as it is allows us to assess damage and thus aid the distribution of relief, but it tells us little about how the people in such areas will react to the devastation. This paper demonstrates a prototype spatially explicit agent-based model, created using crowdsourced geographic information and other sources of publicly available data, which can be used to study the aftermath of a catastrophic event. The specific case modelled here is the Haiti earthquake of January 2010. Crowdsourced data is used to build the initial populations of people affected by the event, to construct their environment, and to set their needs based on the damage to buildings. We explore how people react to the distribution of aid, as well as how rumours relating to aid availability propagate through the population. Such a model could potentially provide a link between socio-cultural information about the people affected and the relevant humanitarian relief organizations.}

Background is provided that traces the development of the use of geographic information in intelligence gathering and use, introducing the founding of the US National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and its adoption of GEOINT as a key form of intelligence. This strategy transformed the nature of how geospatial technologies were adopted and integrated to provide actionable intelligence to decision makers. As the transition to GEOINT became complete, demands on intelligence changed due to asymmetric warfare, leading to a movement toward the human terrain program and later, the adoption of human geography as an emphasis to understanding complex cultural contexts, such as insurgencies. Most recently, GEOINT has included university collaborations, certification programs, and the emergence of a United States Geospatial Intelligence Foundation. GEOINT is again transforming itself in an era of cyberwarfare, volunteered geographic information, and global climate change and its consequences for both security and new technologies and threats.}

Our objective was to validate Safecast data by comparing Safecast data with authoritative data collected by the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the U. S.

VGI has shifted the ways information is created, shared, used and experienced, with important implications for applications of geospatial data, including emergency management. Detailed interviews with 13 emergency management professionals from eight organisations across five Australian states provided insights into the impacts of VGI on official emergency management. Perceived opportunities presented by VGI included improved communication, acquisition of diverse local information, and increased community engagement in disaster management. Identified challenges included the digital divide, data management, misinformation, and liability concerns. Significantly, VGI disrupts the traditional top-down structure of emergency management and reflects a culture shift away from authoritative control of information. To capitalise on the opportunities of VGI, agencies need to share responsibility and be willing to remain flexible in supporting positive community practises, including VGI. Given the high accountability and inherently responsive nature of decision making in disaster management, it provides a useful lens through which to examine the impacts of VGI on official authoritative systems more broadly. This analysis of the perceptions of emergency management professionals suggests changes to traditional systems that involve decentralisation of power and increased empowerment of citizens, where value is increasingly recognised in both expert and citizen-produced information, initiatives and practises.}

However, relatively few studies within the realm of NBS have reported on experiences in using volunteered information, or their results. This reflects an important gap, not least because of the proliferation of proposals and bids that rely upon or integrate such methods into their approach. We report on experiences with gathering information using a ‘bottom-up’ map-based wiki tool, which effectively sought to crowd-source data, contributed by members of the public and professional stakeholders. As we approach the milestone of ‘10 years on’ from the inception of the website www.daylighting.org.uk, we reflect on our approach, the opportunities presented, constraints encountered, progress made and results delivered. This is contrasted with other resources and data-gathering projects having similar aims for different urban NBS. Findings are presented on the substantive issue of the uptake of deculverting as a particular form of NBS, including land-use contexts, scheme costs and achievement of stated objectives.

The aim of this paper is to investigate the use of data from OpenStreetMap (OSM) to enhance the development of LCZs, complement the existing data sources, and improve the accuracy of the maps. Various features were derived from the OSM database and combined with seasonal LCZ maps. Therefore a methodology was developed and tested for Hamburg, Germany, using a fuzzy approach and then a weighted combination method was applied to combine the inputs from OSM with each of the seasonal LCZ maps. The results showed that improvements can be achieved for certain classes, either in terms of accuracy, e.g. rectifying the misclassification of agricultural areas as heavy industry, or representation on the map, e.g. a more detailed water network. The approach developed is flexible and allows for knowledge about which data sources are more reliable as inputs to the combination and weighting process.}

Remote sensing data, especially the nighttime light images, have been widely used to delineate urbanized areas across the world. Meanwhile, some emerging urban data, such as volunteered geographical information (e.g., OpenStreetMap) and social sensing data (e.g., mobile phone and social media), have also shown great potential in revealing urban boundaries and dynamics. However, consistent and robust methods to quantify urban areas from these multi-source data have remained elusive. Here, we propose a percolation-based method to extract urban areas from these multi-source urban data. We derive the optimal urban/non-urban threshold by considering the critical nature of urban systems with the support of the percolation theory. Furthermore, we apply the method with three open-source datasets – population, road, and nighttime light – to 28 countries. We show that the proposed method captures the similar urban characteristics in terms of urban areas from multi-source data, and Zipf's law holds well in most countries. The accuracy of the derived urban areas by different datasets has been validated with the Landsat-based reference data in 10 cities, and the accuracy can be further improved through data fusion (κ = 0.69–0.85, mean κ = 0.78). Our study not only provides an efficient method to quantify urban areas with open-source data, but also deepens the understanding of urban systems and sheds some light on multi-source data fusion in geographical fields.}

In this paper, we study the integration of VGI in Spatial OLAP (SOLAP) systems, which allow the integration and analysis of large volumes of good quality data. Using a real-world scenario, we highlight some similarities and differences among these two types of systems. We define a conceptual quality-oriented framework for warehousing and OLAPing VGI data. In particular, to address precision and credibility problems related to VGI data, we propose two new ETL operators: aggregation based on the VGI credibility and a filter based on the historical precision. We also define a new spatio-multidimensional model that provides decision makers with a global description of the quality of the aggregated data. To validate our proposal, we extend the classical relational SOLAP architecture using a standard VGI system.}

abstract = {Two dimensional flood inundation models capable of simulating complex spatially and temporally differentiated floodplain flows are routinely used to model and predict flooding. However, advances in modelling techniques have not been matched by improvements in model validation. Validation of flood models remains challenging due to a lack of available spatially-explicit data; traditionally measured data and validation approaches reveal little about the ability of a model to simulate the complex dynamics of floodplain flows, including the pathways, timeline, and impacts of an event. In this paper we propose a novel method for the validation of hydraulic models of flooding using quantitative and qualitative Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI). This method uses VGI data to enhance traditionally measured validation data by reconstructing the observed dynamics of a flood, allowing validation of the temporal and spatial simulation of these dynamics. We illustrate the method using a case study from Corbridge in the northeast of England, using VGI collected through participatory research with people affected by severe flooding in 2015. The results of the study demonstrate that VGI data can be used for the effective reconstruction of flood event dynamics. The results also reveal that the proposed validation approach is able to identify underperformance in the model’s simulation of event dynamics not evaluated by standard global performance measures. Such a lack of evaluation can have adverse consequences where dynamic model outputs are used locally to influence floodplain management. As a result, we propose a new framework for model validation, adopting a pragmatic and flexible approach to examining event dynamics using a diverse range of data.}

In contrast to typical volunteered geographic information applications which rely on the conscious and active contribution of information, most social sensing happens on-the-go, that is, as by-product of human behavior and interaction with technology. Social Sensing has great potential for many applications in urban planning, transportation, crime prevention, health, and so on. In this paper, we focus on a technique called semantic signatures to extract and share high-dimensional data about places. Such semantic signatures reveal how people interact with their environment such as the times they visit places of a certain type (e.g., Winery), how they communicate about such places, and how these places are distributed throughout space. We will provide an overview of signatures, methods to extract them, and highlight examples for their usage from previous work ranging from location privacy and the extraction of regions to reverse geocoding.}

The seven major elements of cybercartography outlined in the first edition have been supplemented by six key ideas, and the definition of cybercartography has been extended and expanded. The new practice of mapping a traditional knowledge (TK) in partnership with indigenous people has led to a new theoretical understanding as well as innovative cybercartographic atlases. The chapter explores the nature of TK as a ‘people’s way of knowing’ and how to best represent this. A cybermap is a physical artifact but also a cognitive and social construct. The chapter considers the relationship between cybercartography and critical cartography, volunteered geographic information and the relationship with the individual user. The holistic nature of cybercartography is explained and important legal and ethical issues are explored. The chapter includes a brief description of key issues reflected in the 22 chapters of the book and concludes that cybercartography meets the challenges posed by Tim Berners-Lee for the Web 3.0 era.}

Volunteered geographical information, in particular OpenStreetMap (OSM), shows great potential in providing the knowledge of human settlements to support humanitarian aid, while the availability and quality of OSM remains a major concern. The majority of existing works in assessing OSM data quality focus on either extrinsic or intrinsic analysis, which is insufficient to fulfill the humanitarian mapping scenario to a certain degree. This paper aims to explore OSM missing built-up areas from an integrative perspective of social sensing and remote sensing. First, applying hierarchical DBSCAN clustering algorithm, the clusters of geo-tagged tweets are generated as proxies of human active regions. Then a deep learning based model fine-tuned on existing OSM data is proposed to further map the missing built-up areas. Hit by Cyclone Idai and Kenneth in 2019, the Republic of Mozambique is selected as the study area to evaluate the proposed method at a national scale. As a result, 13 OSM missing built-up areas are identified and mapped with an over 90% overall accuracy, being competitive compared to state-of-the-art products, which confirms the effectiveness of the proposed method.}

Crowdsourcing modes range from harvesting information passively transmitted by large groups on the web to actively engaging the crowd to generate data by using dedicated mobile apps and web-platforms. The latter, active crowdsourcing projects, were described in more detail by analysing the organizational variables of the twelve projects that were identified. Crowdsourcing has great potential to advance the field of landscape perception & preference research as it enables the in-situ collection of real-time, location-based data. One of the main limitations of reviewed active and passive crowdsourcing modes, lies in the fact that sample selection bias easily occurs and sample representativeness of any target population has been proven hard to achieve. Often crowdsourcing projects are implemented with a strong focus on technical aspects and content, but with insufficient attention for participant engagement. Projects would benefit from more inter- and transdisciplinary approaches and professionalizing campaigns, and thereby bringing participant engagement to the heart of the project. We recommend more attention to be placed towards awareness raising, diversification of formats and activities to reach a larger diversity of participants, structured tracking of performance indicators and learning from participants’ feedback. Such strategies aim at enhancing participation and reducing bias in participant selection, which constrains the usefulness of the results for research, planning and policy.}

abstract = {During the last decade, web technologies and location sensing devices have evolved generating a form of crowdsourcing known as Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI). VGI acted as a platform of spatial data collection, in particular, when a group of public participants are involved in collaborative mapping activities: they work together to collect, share, and use information about geographic features. VGI exploits participants’ local knowledge to produce rich data sources. However, the resulting data inherits problematic data classification. In VGI projects, the challenges of data classification are due to the following: (i) data is likely prone to subjective classification, (ii) remote contributions and flexible contribution mechanisms in most projects, and (iii) the uncertainty of spatial data and non-strict definitions of geographic features. These factors lead to various forms of problematic classification: inconsistent, incomplete, and imprecise data classification. This research addresses classification appropriateness. Whether the classification of an entity is appropriate or inappropriate is related to quantitative and/or qualitative observations. Small differences between observations may be not recognizable particularly for non-expert participants. Hence, in this paper, the problem is tackled by developing a rule-guided classification approach. This approach exploits data mining techniques of Association Classification (AC) to extract descriptive (qualitative) rules of specific geographic features. The rules are extracted based on the investigation of qualitative topological relations between target features and their context. Afterwards, the extracted rules are used to develop a recommendation system able to guide participants to the most appropriate classification. The approach proposes two scenarios to guide participants towards enhancing the quality of data classification. An empirical study is conducted to investigate the classification of grass-related features like forest, garden, park, and meadow. The findings of this study indicate the feasibility of the proposed approach.}

In the case of smartphone apps for fitness tracking, results of this data can be used similar to the growing application of global positioning systems for automotive travel surveying. The authors evaluate data from Travis County, Texas for the purpose of determining where bicyclists ride, primarily for fitness purposes. Ride trip volumes are evaluated with residential and employment density, land use diversity, bicycle facilities and terrain to characterize places chosen for bicycling for health. Though limited to bicycle rides and routes voluntarily logged using the smartphone app, this method provides promise for applications in multi-modal transportation planning and health impact assessment studies.}

abstract = {Developing countries, especially in Africa are faced with a lack of formally registered land. Available limited records are outdated, inaccurate and unreliable, which makes it a challenge to properly administer and manage land and its resources. In the face of such problems, a large proportion of the population in developing countries depends on land and its resources for their sustenance. Developing countries are unable to adopt traditional land administration systems (LAS) due to their lack of capacity and financial constraints. Traditional LAS are characterised by expensive licence fees, procedures, and maintenance structures which are not feasible in developing countries. Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) has the potential to address these challenges by providing timely, affordable, up-to-date, flexible, and fit for purpose (FFP) land information to support the limited current systems. This paper investigates major aspects of developing a conceptual participatory framework for a FFP land administration based on VGI, and conducts a case study in how the system can be applied in local processes, in the context of customary land tenure system in Botswana. The aspects were successfully implemented in the case study area to demonstrate their applicability and roles they could play in ensuring that VGI is reliable and conforms to the legal and institutional regulations of Land Boards. It has further provided an understanding of how VGI can be collected, assessed, and utilized at Land Boards to improve key land transactions on a FFP basis. Furthermore, innovative approaches to Trust and Reputation Modelling (TRM) are presented, minimising the need for ground-truthing of VGI data.}

The proposed PPGIS assesses the age-friendliness of cities through integrating certain criteria weights determined by the elderly with VGI collected by regular citizens. The system was used to create the age-friendliness map of district # 6 of Tehran, Iran. The resulting map shows that the center of the district is more age-friendly than the other areas. Based on the evaluation results, the majority of citizens found the system to be a suitable tool for evaluating the age-friendliness of the city, collecting VGI related to the elderly’s urban environment and helping urban planners improve the age-friendliness of the city. Nonetheless, a rather small percentage of citizens concur that: (i) the PPGIS is a suitable tool for persuading citizens to participate in the city age-friendliness assessment and that (ii) the PPGIS provides a reliable way for assessing the age-friendliness of cities.}

In recent years, with the increasing popularity and use of social media, people have started to express their views, experiences, images, and video evidences through different social media platforms. Consequently, harnessing such crowdsourced information has become an opportunity for authorities to obtain enhanced situation awareness data for efficient disaster management practices. Nonetheless, the current disaster-related Twitter analytics methods are not versatile enough to define disaster impacts levels as interpreted by the local communities. This paper contributes to the existing knowledge by applying and extending a well-established data analysis framework, and identifying highly impacted disaster areas as perceived by the local communities. For this, the study used real-time Twitter data posted during the 2010–2011 South East Queensland Floods. The findings reveal that: (a) Utilising Twitter is a promising approach to reflect citizen knowledge; (b) Tweets could be used to identify the fluctuations of disaster severity over time; (c) The spatial analysis of tweets validates the applicability of geo-located messages to demarcate highly impacted disaster zones.}

The quality indicators represent both the extrinsic quality, depending on the characteristics and reputation of the sources of information; the intrinsic quality, depending on the distinct accuracy and precision of information; and, last but not least, the pragmatic quality, depending on the user needs and intended purposes. In order to assess the pragmatic quality of VGI items, a linguistic decision making approach is defined that allows users to rank and finally filter the VGI items based on the satisfaction of distinct criteria expressed by means of both linguistic terms, defining soft constraints on the distinct quality indicators, and linguistic aggregators, defining fuzzy operators which combine the satisfaction degrees of the soft constraints at distinct hierarchical levels to yield the final satisfaction of the VGI items. Finally, an example of quality assessment in a glaciological citizen science project is discussed.}

The article presents a case study of Reykjavík, Iceland, where a simple ‘emotional mapping’ platform was used to enable cyclists to express their emotional reactions to routes and places. A sample of 100 users identified some 541 features - lines and points - on a map of the city, associated them with either ‘good’ or ‘bad’ emotions and wrote textual comments to elaborate on the reasons for their judgement. The results indicate clearly the importance of the natural environment for cyclists, as well as the negative feeling engendered by cycling close to car traffic or in the street with the cars. These data support the emphases found in the present bicycling plan of Reykjavík city. In general, volunteered geographical information and crowdsourcing has much potential for increasing citizen participation in urban planning. A flexible software platform for participatory mapping, such as the one used in the study, can be a valuable addition to the planner‘s toolbox.}

OSM is known as one of the most extensively used instances of Crowdsourcing Geographic Data (CSGD)/Crowdsourced Geographic Information (CGI), Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI), or the Neogeography paradigm. Economically, OSM development can be beneficial for governments, especially in developing countries such as Iran, where financial support is limited. This paper analyzes the spatial pattern, evolution, density, and diversity of OSM road (OSMr) networks in Iran between 2008 and 2016 and looks to find casual relations between the OSM and census statistics. This is due to the fact that OSMr completeness reflects the importance of OSM data in human life. The diversity of OSM roads further reflects the concerns, requirements, and worthiness of clients about different roads’ information. The results show that the road network in Iran considerably increased from 2008 to 2016, with road length increasing to 489,400 km in 2016 from 4300 km in 2008. In addition, road density grew while road diversity and evenness declined, which could be due to an increase in main roads. These results propose a more considerable need for a more comprehensive approach using VGI to supplement gaps in authoritative data in developing countries.}

Benefits include that data can be collected remotely, relatively simply and at low-cost, it complements other data sources, and can be effective in spatial and temporal analysis of visitation, to assess diverse cultural ecosystem services, evaluate visitor sentiments and assign economic values, with similar results to surveys and/or visitor counts. Limitations include fluctuations in popularity and access to data, that it only represents some visitors, areas and activities, demographic data is often limited, and there are important ethical issues. While more research from more locations is required, overall, social media is likely to be increasingly valuable for research and management of nature-based tourism.}

abstract = {During the last 30years it has become commonplace for epidemiological studies to collect locational attributes of disease data. Although this advancement was driven largely by the introduction of handheld global positioning systems (GPS), and more recently, smartphones and tablets with built-in GPS, the collection of georeferenced disease data has moved beyond the use of handheld GPS devices and there now exist numerous sources of crowdsourced georeferenced disease data such as that available from georeferencing of Google search queries or Twitter messages. In addition, cartography has moved beyond the realm of professionals to crowdsourced mapping projects that play a crucial role in disease control and surveillance of outbreaks such as the 2014 West Africa Ebola epidemic. This paper provides a comprehensive review of a range of innovative sources of spatial animal and human health data including data warehouses, mHealth, Google Earth, volunteered geographic information and mining of internet-based big data sources such as Google and Twitter. We discuss the advantages, limitations and applications of each, and highlight studies where they have been used effectively.}

abstract = {With increasing urbanization, in recent years there has been a growing interest and need in monitoring and analyzing urban flood events. Social media, as a new data source, can provide real-time information for flood monitoring. The social media posts with locations are often referred to as Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI), which can reveal the spatial pattern of such events. Since more images are shared on social media than ever before, recent research focused on the extraction of flood-related posts by analyzing images in addition to texts. Apart from merely classifying posts as flood relevant or not, more detailed information, e.g. the flood severity, can also be extracted based on image interpretation. However, it has been less tackled and has not yet been applied for flood severity mapping. In this paper, we propose a novel three-step process to extract and map flood severity information. First, flood relevant images are retrieved with the help of pre-trained convolutional neural networks as feature extractors. Second, the images containing people are further classified into four severity levels by observing the relationship between body parts and their partial inundation, i.e. images are classified according to the water level with respect to different body parts, namely ankle, knee, hip, and chest. Lastly, locations of the Tweets are used for generating a map of estimated flood extent and severity. This process was applied to an image dataset collected during Hurricane Harvey in 2017, as a proof of concept. The results show that VGI can be used as a supplement to remote sensing observations for flood extent mapping and is beneficial, especially for urban areas, where the infrastructure is often occluding water. Based on the extracted water level information, an integrated overview of flood severity can be provided for the early stages of emergency response.}

Unfortunately, Mexico is one of the countries with the highest unrecorded crime rates worldwide. So, according to different unofficial reports, in 2016, the unrecorded crime rate for common jurisdiction crimes was greater than 90%. Thus, it is not possible to define an efficient decision-making process because the real number of crimes, specially the specific geographic location of these crimes, is not known. In 2016, the official INEGI reported two main factors that contribute with the unrecorded crime rate: corruption and lack of confidence (victim personal information) provided from government security institutions. In recent years, several web and mobile applications have been developed, based on volunteered geographic information scheme to collect criminal anonymous information related to this issue. However, the point to define methodologies that allow us to identify multiple records related to the same crime event is necessary. The main goal of this chapter is to generate public policies and guidelines to improve the administration of justice, taking into consideration certain values of criminal incidence, along with a clear identification of kinds of events presented. Thus, this chapter is oriented to generate statistical data by applying ITC technologies to produce both good and safety policies. In addition to this, a case study focused on the application of artificial intelligence algorithms to analyze and classify crime reports is presented as well.}

Immediate responses by corporations and governments were geared toward building knowledge so that accurate and efficient programs could be devised toward curbing the impacts of the pandemic on society. However, one aspect to this was noted as to the limited availability of data sharing across platforms, systems, and jurisdictions, leading to limited datasets, hence, rendering inaccurate predictions that can be used to contain and limit the virus outbreak. In view of required immediate actions, volunteered geographic information (VGI) and citizen science concept have emerged, where people voluntarily share location and health status data to circumvent data sharing restrictions imposed upon corporations and governments. This is leading to more accurate predictions and supporting an emergence of alternative tools. This chapter explores this dimension and outlines how people, previously aggressively resisting data sharing, do so willingly in times of emergencies.}

In this study, the quality of crowdsourced information from Public Participation GIS (PPGIS) and Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) sources (Flickr, OpenStreetMap (OSM), and Wikipedia) was compared with visitor counts that are presumed to reflect social importance. Using the state of Victoria, Australia as a case study, secondary crowdsourced VGI data, primary crowdsourced (PPGIS data) and visitor statistics were examined for their correspondence and differences, and to identify spatial patterns in park popularity. Data completeness—the percent of protected areas with data—varied between sources, being highest for OSM (90%), followed by Flickr (41%), PPGIS (24%), visitation counts (5%), and Wikipedia articles (4%). Statistically significant correlations were found between all five measures of popularity for protected areas. Using stepwise multiple linear regression, the explained variability in visitor numbers was greater than 70%, with PPGIS, Flickr and OSM having the largest standardized coefficients. The social importance of protected areas varied as a function of accessibility and the types of values (direct or indirect use) expressed for the areas. Crowdsourced data may provide an alternative to visitor counts for assessing protected area social importance and spatial variability of visitation. However, crowdsourced data appears to be an unreliable proxy for the full range of values and importance of protected areas, especially for non-use values such as biological conservation.}

This paper explores the capacity of one increasingly prevalent source of these data, geographically encoded photographs, to capture spatial expressions of place in an urban environment. Geotagged photographs were obtained from the Flickr API to build a geographic database of photographs for the city of Vancouver, Canada from 2001–2012. These data were aggregated to multiple geographic units represented as hexagonal lattices. Spatial patterns of photo aggregation were examined for tessellations that ranged from 0.25ha to 1024ha. Tags associated with each photo were also explored through the notion of ‘tag-space’ at multiple resolutions, or “scales”, of analysis through local log-odds ratios. Results indicate a significant interaction between tag-space semantics and spatial aggregation which suggests that consideration of scale effects should be integral to analysis of this type of tagged VGI for exploring citizens’ sensing of urban environments. The results indicate further that we may have to reconsider the interaction between encoded meaning, the methods used for extracting such meaning from tag-space, and exogenous and endogenous spatial scales of spatial UGC.}

Citizens’ resources in the form of knowledge, skills, as well as their collaboration with authorities have been identified in the governance literature as crucial elements in sustainable development. Technical advancement in internet communication technology (ICT) presents novel opportunities for engaging and leveraging civic knowledge and skills into different levels of governance. These options are still largely unexplored in governance research on urban green infrastructure (UGI). In this paper, we analyse three different digital tools (e-tools) from the perspective of a Scandinavian planning context. We explore how e-tools can support UGI governance and the perceived barriers. The e-tools explored are three digital platforms with a focus on public participation related to UGI. The three e-tools are map-based, i.e., users share information on digital maps: so-called Volunteered Geographic Information. Here, we call them place-based e-tools. We explore and analyse their adoption into UGI governance, the institutional contexts that affect them and also discuss potential of e-tools in place-based governance. Our findings indicate that the analysed tools all facilitate UGI governance in terms of engaging citizens in use, management, and planning of UGI. However, there are challenges to be aware of, such as the digital divide and the importance of clear participatory frameworks. We conclude that place-based e-tools have potential for UGI governance and that there is potential to strengthen links to ‘place’, while continuously testing and challenging new opportunities as technology rapidly develops.}

OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a rich source of openly available, volunteered geographic information that has a high potential to complement these representations. However, identity links between the knowledge graph entities and OSM nodes are still rare. The problem of link discovery in these settings is particularly challenging due to the lack of a strict schema and heterogeneity of the user-defined node representations in OSM. In this article, we propose OSM2KG - a novel link discovery approach to predict identity links between OSM nodes and geographic entities in a knowledge graph. The core of the OSM2KG approach is a novel latent, compact representation of OSM nodes that captures semantic node similarity in an embedding. OSM2KG adopts this latent representation to train a supervised model for link prediction and utilises existing links between OSM and knowledge graphs for training. Our experiments conducted on several OSM datasets, as well as the Wikidata and DBpedia knowledge graphs, demonstrate that OSM2KG can reliably discover identity links. OSM2KG achieves an F1 score of 92.05% on Wikidata and of 94.17% on DBpedia on average, which corresponds to a 21.82 percentage points increase in F1 score on Wikidata compared to the best performing baselines.}

abstract = {Landmarks, objects in the environment used for orientation, navigation and the formation of cognitive maps are often represented in maps as pictograms. In order to support these tasks effectively and efficiently, landmark pictograms also need to be salient, as the map user needs to identify and process them quickly and easily. Two additional relevant characteristics for the usability of landmark pictograms are their meaningfulness and recognition performance. Meaningfulness is required to understand which categories of objects are represented by the pictograms. Ease of recognition prevents the necessity to consult a map repetitively and may support the formation of a cognitive map of the environment. In the present study, we investigated the relation between salience, meaningfulness and recognition performance of OpenStreetMap (OSM) pictograms and the potential effects of the visual complexity of pictograms on these usability characteristics. Salience was measured via eye fixations on specific pictograms, meaningfulness with an explicit continuous scale and recognition performance with a yes/no recognition memory paradigm. Statistical analyses showed that pictograms drew more visual attention if they were visually complex or if their meaning was inapprehensible or ambiguous. Less apprehensible pictograms were also recognized more often. Interestingly, the data indicated that longer fixations could lead to worse recognition performance. Long fixations on a pictogram may increase the likelihood of false recognition in subsequent situations where the pictogram is no longer valid or relevant. Based on the findings, we suggest balancing the meaningfulness and visual complexity of contiguous pictograms to enhance their recognition and to provide an optimal level of salience of single objects.}

In metropolitan areas, more greenways are interconnected, forming a greenway network (GN). A GN is considered to encourage physical activities, but verifying this statement is difficult, as traditional social survey methods do not obtain fine-grain activity geographic data on a large scale. In view of this shortcoming, the volunteered geographic information and the geographic information system techniques were used to describe the distribution of physical activities in a GN, to explore the effects of greenway network features on supporting activities. The 1640-km-long Shenzhen GN was selected as a representative case, and walking, jogging and cycling were chosen as typical activities. The results showed that only a quarter of greenways were with activities. Greenways with dense residences, mixed land-use, advanced street network and large parks yielded positive effects on supporting physical activities, and advanced public transportation further improved activity diversity. Due to the spatial mismatch between the GN distribution and well-developed areas, the GN density showed negative effects on the presence of physical activities; within the greenways in use, the GN density significantly improved activity diversity, indicating the positive effect of network feature on supporting activities. Compared with neighbourhood greenways, city and regional greenways supported more physical activities due to richer natural resources. The findings reveal that GN in green and welldeveloped areas supports physical activities better. Location, green quality and network form are necessary for greenways and should be integrated into GN planning.}

Satellite images also provide important clues to both the past and present surface conditions of other planets, which cannot be validated on the ground. With the volume of satellite imagery continuing to grow, the inadequacy of computerised solutions to manage and process imagery to the required professional standard is of critical concern. Whilst studies find the crowd sourcing approach suitable for the counting of impact craters in single images, images of higher resolution contain a much wider range of features, and the performance of novices in identifying more complex features and detecting change, remains unknown. This paper presents a first step towards understanding whether novices can identify and annotate changes in different geomorphological features. A website was developed to enable visitors to flick between two images of the same location on Mars taken at different times and classify 1) if a surface feature changed and if so, 2) what feature had changed from a pre-defined list of six. Planetary scientists provided “expert” data against which classifications made by novices could be compared when the project subsequently went public. Whilst no significant difference was found in images identified with surface changes by expert and novices, results exhibited differences in consensus within and between experts and novices when asked to classify the type of change. Experts demonstrated higher levels of agreement in classification of changes as dust devil tracks, slope streaks and impact craters than other features, whilst the consensus of novices was consistent across feature types; furthermore, the level of consensus amongst regardless of feature type. These trends are secondary to the low levels of consensus found, regardless of feature type or classifier expertise. These findings demand the attention of researchers who want to use crowd-sourcing for similar scientific purposes, particularly for the supervised training of computer algorithms, and inform the scope and design of future projects.}

Therefore, we compared how mountain bikers, runners and walkers use popular reserves (Daisy Hill Conservation Park, Venman Bushland National Park and Bayview Conservation Area) close to Brisbane, Australia, based on extracted route data from the fitness tracking application MapMyFitness. Routes for all three activity types were displayed and analysed using ArcGIS. Mountain biking was more popular (49% of the 948 routes), than walking (27%) or running (24%) across the three reserves. Route data was effective at predicting the relative popularity of specific trails with significant linear regressions when compared with fixed-point trail counts (R2 = 0.681). Bikers went further, used a greater range of trail combinations and used more reserves per trip than the other two activities. Weekends were popular for all three activities, but more so for biking (57%), than walking (44%), or running (43%). The results highlight how volunteered geographic information complements other trail data allowing urban planners and managers to better assess visitor movements in reserves. A number of specific management challenges were identified, such as bikers using more areas within and across the reserves, and in some cases, the use of private land and unauthorised access points.}

The new practice of mapping a traditional knowledge (TK) in partnership with indigenous people has led to a new theoretical understanding as well as innovative cybercartographic atlases. The chapter explores the nature of TK as a ‘people's way of knowing’ and how to best represent this. A cybermap is a physical artefact but also a cognitive and social construct. The chapter considers the relationship between Cybercartography and critical cartography, volunteered geographic information and the relationship with the individual user. The holistic nature of Cybercartography is explained and important legal and ethical issues are explored.

Volunteered geographic information (VGI) phenomenon offers an alternative mechanism for the acquisition of geospatial information. It has shown its effectiveness in various applications such as disaster management. However VGI suffers from a general lack of metadata quality assurance. This paper proposes an approach that aims to enhance VGI process by evaluating geospatial metadata quality. We introduce a set of indicators for geospatial metadata quality and we propose a method to evaluate them with respect to the context of VGI.}

In the age of Big Data, it is possible to construct gazetteers in a data-driven approach by mining rich volunteered geographic information (VGI) from the Web. In this research, we build a scalable distributed platform and a high-performance geoprocessing workflow based on the Hadoop ecosystem to harvest crowd-sourced gazetteer entries. Using experiments based on geotagged datasets in Flickr, we find that the MapReduce-based workflow running on the spatially enabled Hadoop cluster can reduce the processing time compared with traditional desktop-based operations by an order of magnitude. We demonstrate how to use such a novel spatial-computing infrastructure to facilitate gazetteer research. In addition, we introduce a provenance-based trust model for quality assurance. This work offers new insights on enriching future gazetteers with the use of Hadoop clusters, and makes contributions in connecting GIS to the cloud computing environment for the next frontier of Big Geo-Data analytics.}

The Safecast data are calibrated using observations acquired by the U.S. Department of Energy at the time of the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi power plant nuclear accident. The methodology performs a series of interpolations between the U.S. government and contributed datasets at specific temporal windows and at corresponding spatial locations. The coefficients found for all the different temporal windows are aggregated and interpolated using quadratic regressions to generate a time dependent calibration function. Normal background radiation, decay rates, and missing values are taken into account during the analysis. Results show that the standard Safecast static transformation function overestimates the official measurements because it fails to capture the presence of two different Cesium isotopes and their changing magnitudes with time. A model is created to predict the ratio of the isotopes from the time of the accident through 2020. The proposed time dependent calibration takes into account this Cesium isotopes ratio, and it is shown to reduce the error between U.S. government and contributed data. The proposed calibration is needed through 2020, after which date the errors introduced by ignoring the presence of different isotopes will become negligible.}

With the exponential increase in volunteered geographic information, it is now possible to assess visitation to parks by people using social media. The number of routes posted to MapMyFitness, Strava and Wikiloc were used to assess the relative popularity of 40 national parks in South East Queensland, Australia for mountain biking, walking and running. Then, using generalised linear models, the topographic, geographic, management and environmental variables that best predicted park popularity among users were identified. There were more than 450,000 visits to the parks, with 98% of routes posted on Strava. Distance (road and direct distance) from large urban areas best predicted visitation using routes from MapMyFitness and Strava with three parks within 2 km of urban areas experiencing over 70,000 visits (Strava). For urban parks, recreational trail length best predicted usage, while for more remote parks, the direct distance to urban areas remained the most important factor. In contrast, people using the adventure platform Wikiloc preferred more remote parks with rugged terrain. The results highlight factors affecting park popularity including distance. With the expansion and densification of cities, including in Australia, urban and peri-urban parks are likely to experience increasing levels of use for fitness-based activities while more remote parks may remain attractive among people focused on adventure.}

Challenges include an asymmetric access to technology and GIS skills, as well as the recognition and validation of citizen data. Opportunities, on the other hand, include the possibility for citizens to express their needs to municipalities and the provision of up-to-date, accurate information to urban planners. Due to its bottom-up conceptualization of data collection, VGI could take a leading role in providing spatial information to planning efforts which aim at understanding and improving the realities of informal settlements.}

However, current solutions for land-use discovery based on user-generated data usually rely on an information retrieval mechanism applied on a textual corpus. This causes ad-hoc place labelling with limited semantic meaning. In this line, the present work introduces a novel data-driven methodology that extends existing solutions by means of a classifier based on a pre-defined hierarchy of land categories. Two types of social networks –text-based and venue-based platforms– are utilized to train the classifier, which is then applied to infer the use of the land based on text data in areas where venue data are not available. The approach has been evaluated by using large datasets comprising two large cities, showing an accuracy above 90% in predicting the land-use categories.}

The collection contains local scale imagery covering all parts of Denmark recorded between 1930 and 1990 and thus has the potential to illustrate the changes which took place in the rural landscape as a whole after the Second World War, in ways which are suited for use at local scales. Taking into account that landscape change normally happens at a slow rate relative to the perceptive scale of humans, with fine grained changes taking place continuously in local settings, images of this kind present themselves as a way for the general public to become aware of changes which might otherwise be overlooked. To a still more urbanized population where most people do not have an every-day experience with rural landscape change, the images may be a starting point for a renewed engagement with landscapes, not just perceived as a scenery, but rather as a process of interaction with the environment. In order to inform a wider range of people, in competition with other types of information, the imagery provides a point of reference – a single farm or landscape known to the users – which people without specific training in landscape research can relate to. The use of a crowdsourcing approach in data generation on a webgis application means that the broader public is both involved in the creation of the data and in the discussion about the changes observed, which become visible when comparing old aerial photographs to the present landscape. In combination with the very local nature of the aerial photographs, this opens up the possibility that the images could serve as a communicational bridge between “abstract” scientific knowledge about landscape change (e.g. change in hedgerow density per year) and the local landscapes where people are living. As such, the approach described in this paper may contribute to the objectives set out in the European landscape convention to facilitate an increased understanding of landscape issues among the public through a democratic learning process. The article concludes, that this approach has a huge potential, although some difficulties exist, relating to the challenge of maintaining a focus on the landscape when using a form of communication which is dialogue-based and relatively unstructured compared to approaches embedded within conventional learning environments.}

For coastal and beach managers, it is important to know who visits beaches, when and where they go and what they value. However, as beaches are long linear structures often with multiple access points, collecting this data can be challenging. Using data from the image sharing platform Flickr, we compared temporal and spatial patterns of use between locals, Australian and international tourists along 31 km of beaches in the sixth largest city in Australia, the Gold Coast. Beaches are popular with 9.8% of all images of the Gold Coast on Flickr taken from a beach. Out of the nearly 7,000 images posted by 908 people on, or near, Gold Coast beaches, 2,388 were posted by 124 locals, 964 by other Australians, and 1,444 by 234 international visitors, mainly from the USA, United Kingdom and New Zealand. Australians, including locals, were more likely than international visitors to take images early in the day and on weekends. There were images from almost every section of the beaches along the coast, with locals using more of the beaches, and each group having their own favourite places. Locals used more words to describe the images, and the most common used words were related to geographic location, natural features, time of the day and activities or events. Despite important limitations, including who uses social media platforms such as Flickr and why, data from geolocated social media images can be a low cost, quick and effective way for managers and others to monitor spatiotemporal patterns of use of open spaces in coastal cities, complementing traditional data.}

abstract = {Individualization of tenure through title registration programmes introduced in many African countries after independence with the promise of security of tenure and increased agricultural productivity has, instead, had the opposite effect. Informal land arrangements continue to emerge as a result of the slow pace of land adjudication (formalization) and updating of land information systems. The trend towards computerization of land information systems has only put focus on already existing formal land tenure arrangements, leaving out the informal social tenure arrangements. As a result, there are now many efforts worldwide motivated by the introduction of the Social Tenure Domain Model (STDM), and freely-available and easy-to-use technology tools to identify, document and map land in support of informal land administration arrangements. Actions are made towards the use of community-generated information to support land administration. Using theories from the interplay between formal and informal institutions, this paper discusses the potential outcomes in adopting Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) in land administration in Kenya. Two case studies are presented that demonstrate the complementary-accommodating, versus the substitutive-competing approaches. These are then compared with the formal land adjudication process in Kenya. It is established that because of the direct involvement of the national mapping agency in land adjudication where VGI is utilized, the outcome is a case of formal adoption of VGI, while in the other case, where there is little or no involvement by the national mapping agency, the outcome is more of competition and substitution. The latter is an example in which the VGI is used just like any other information to inform policy making, rather than taking it as the authoritative source. We argue that since informality is – and will always be – part and parcel of land administration in many African countries as a result of ingrained social relations and power structures, adopting crowdsourced land information into existing formal land administration systems should consider the particular land administration process, satisfying innate demands and requirements, thus re-engineered to accommodate VGI.}

abstract = {Research on disaster response frequently uses volunteered geographic information (VGI), due to its capability to provide near real-time information during and after a disaster. It is much less commonly used in spatial planning related to disaster management. However, VGI appears to have considerable potential for use in spatial planning and offers some advantages over traditional methods. For example, VGI can capture residents' preferences in a much faster, more timely, and more comprehensive fashion than is possible with, for example, questionnaires and surveys. This research investigates the usefulness of VGI for planning flood evacuation shelters. Using Jakarta, Indonesia, as a case study, we use VGI to capture the locations of flood evacuation shelters based on residents' preferences during flood periods in 2013–2014 and 2014–2015 and compare these with the locations of official shelters. Floods frequently affect Jakarta and the city administration uses VGI in flood emergency responses. Moreover, Jakarta has been identified as having the largest number of active Twitter users among cities worldwide. Thus, Jakarta is an appropriate place to study the use of VGI for planning evacuation shelters. VGI generated by Twitter users was used to identify the shelter locations preferred by Jakarta residents, and more precisely the flood evacuees. Of 171,046 tweets using keywords relating to flood evacuation, the content of 306 tweets indicated that they had been sent from inside or near evacuation shelters. The spatial pattern showed that those tweets were sent from 215 locations, mostly located near flooded areas. The analysis further showed that 35.6% of these shelter locations preferred by residents intersected with the locations of official evacuation shelters. As a general conclusion, our study demonstrates the advantages of using VGI for spatial planning, which mainly relates to the ease of capturing community preferences over a large area.}

High population density, in conjunction with numerous tourists who visit coastal regions along with wastewater from factories, industrial centers, cities, agricultural activities, especially oil contaminants, are amongst major contributors to pollution in coastal areas. Fortunately, developing countries have recently instigated developmental procedures with the participation of the general public in an effort to protect the environment. Thus, one can perceive the importance of creating an appropriate system, which facilitates public participation in monitoring coastal environments. Such a system would notably provide solutions for many issues of pollution management in coastal regions. The purpose of this study is to design and implement a Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI)-based system through integration of concepts and methods from three areas of Geographic Information System (GIS), coastal pollution management, and public participation in order to monitor coastal pollution. After the implementation phase, Nowshahr port city, Mazandaran Province, Iran, was selected as the study area, wherein tourists, residents, and other present individuals were asked to report observable pollutants at their location. After a 3 day monitoring of coastal regions, 98 reports were registered in the system, indicating high amounts of contamination within the respective coastal area. 86% of the total recorded reports were accounts of accumulation of garbage and other dispersed solid material such as foliage and tree trunks, which were somehow the main source of pollution. 10% and 4% of the remaining reports were related to the wastewater pollution and oil contaminants, respectively. According to survey results, 74% of users were satisfied with ease of use and performance of system (26% voted very good and 48% voted good) amongst whom 67% noted the system as an advantageous and effective tool for monitoring the coastal pollution (31% cases of very good and 36% cases of good).}

Further, knowledge of building usage is necessary to model socio-economic aspects such as the distribution of dwellings and population. In an effort to limit costs and resourcing efforts, users and institutes in research and spatial planning are developing strategies to extract such information from existing geographic base data. Currently, land-use information from official datasets merely distinguishes residential from non-residential building usage, but cannot identify areas of non-residential usage inside residential buildings. Additional data sources are therefore needed to fill this gap. In this paper we propose an approach to process semantic information from user-generated OpenStreetMap (OSM) data to specify non-residential usage in residential buildings. This estimation is based on OSM attributes, so-called tags, which are used to define the extent of non-residential usage. Our objective is to identify the potentials and reveal the limitations of integrating semantic OSM data for the evaluation of building usage. Official statistical data on dwellings and population is used to validate results. Thereby we prove the benefit of integrating OpenStreetMap semantic data to refine the estimation of non-residential floor area in the study area of the German City of Dresden, Saxony.}

An increasing number of volunteers which add value to geospatial data require effective ways of organising and providing access to value-added or newly created data. Metadata records are often unavailable for VGI, making it problematic for users to discover data in the VGI system. This paper discusses potential approaches that can be used to create metadata for VGI. This includes Linked Data, professionally created metadata and metadata created by volunteers. The paper then discusses the shortcomings of these approaches and proposes an unconventional alternative, Geospatial Metadata 2.0. This approach involves VGI users in the creation of metadata, and builds on folksonomies created by them. The paper presents the design and implementation of this idea in a prototype system along with an assessment result. The implementation includes Geospatial Metadata 2.0 add-ons in Geonetwork, and the assessment benefits from the input of metadata experts worldwide. The assessment of the benefits results indicate such an approach of metadata creation is promising and has the potential to be employed in VGI systems.}

abstract = {The recent explosive growth of user-generated geographic information has drawn significant attention from GIS scholars and human geographers. Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) here refers to a key component of such a phenomenon, comprising both a range of practices of geographic information production and dissemination by volunteers as well as new forms of geospatial data produced and curated through various interactive online platforms and mobile devices such as OpenStreetMap (OSM) and Google Maps. VGI constructions have raised questions on spatial knowledge, power, and context. Through a study that examines social constructions of OSM in China, this paper makes two contributions to the existing literature: providing a political economic account of VGI constructions in China and exploring legalities in VGI research. Informed by research in critical GIS, this paper traces political economic transitions in relation to OSM constructions and examines OSM contributors' experiences and how these experiences constitute OSM development and usage. Drawing upon law and society research, this paper investigates how OSM mappers encounter the state's regulatory scheme of online mapping. This legality perspective of spatial data production and usage is a topic rarely explored in VGI studies. With interview data and document analysis, this paper unravels processes of powerful state institutional arrangements to control and invest in VGI simultaneously, entrepreneurs' interest in developing location-based services using VGI data, and experiences from a tech-savvy group in exploring and making VGI. While individual experiences vary, they show efforts of questioning embedded power relations shaping spatial data production in these continuously evolving, contested technoscientific and social landscapes.}

Recent advances in digital communication tools and applications have led to unprecedented advances for VGI. Because official credentials are not required, VGI can include the experiences and perspectives of many people, respond rapidly to local needs, and be more spatially and temporally extensive than traditional approaches. VGI encompasses a wide range of activities, from simple and possibly unintentional actions, such as georeferencing messages or pictures shared on the Internet, to the intentional involvement of volunteers in scientific research. The motivations of volunteers and researchers for these activities are wide and ranging and relate to the products that are generated. This article focuses on intentional efforts by geographers to collect VGI. Two main barriers to adoption of VGI for decision making are concerns about data quality and incomplete representation. Strategies to address these concerns can lead to new discoveries and improved decision making in governance. In this article we introduce VGI, discuss theoretical developments, and relate them to three recent experiences.}

This paper proposes an approach to addressing the technical challenge of propagating updates from timely sources (e.g. OpenStreetMap) to spatial data maintained at separate map scales. The main idea is to establish a multiple representation database (MRDB) for datasets at different scales and time to facilitate incremental update, where linkages between corresponding objects at different datasets are made explicit. First, two ways in which the timely sources can be integrated into official data for incremental update are discussed. To derive the linkages between different datasets, a data matching procedure based on computer vision is presented and fine-tuned to match data in different scale ranges. Furthermore, the generalization history used to produce smaller scale data from the larger ones in official data is inferred based on the linkages, and is then used to guide the update propagation. Finally, a framework for incremental generalization in MRDBs is proposed, where crucial issues like strategies for update propagation, cartographic generalization, and the so-called ‘chain reaction’ are addressed. The framework is implemented as a fully automated process where operators like simplification, enlargement, compression, displacement and typification are incorporated into the incremental update process. By testing the framework against real world data sets (i.e. OpenStreetMap and official data at 1:10k, 1:50k and 1:100k), we show that the updates are integrated consistently into existing data in terms of spatial relations and cartographic quality. Our work suggests that making use of timely sources by official mapping agencies and companies in a continuous or event-driven data update is technically feasible, with further improvement and extensions discussed.}

Most geographic datasets including OpenStreetMap are no exception, as these are affected in terms of a growing location–coordinate mismatch. Current research is aware of this issue but solution strategies have not been fully explored yet. In this manuscript, we discuss how regular systematic updates of coordinate values can be used to address this issue. We explore the recommended frequency to perform such updates for guaranteeing a minimal loss of accuracy after long periods of time. It is further determined how rounding errors impair such systematic updates and in which ways singular and irregular manual updates impede systematic solution strategies. The solution strategies proposed lead to minimal overall errors and thus guarantee to retain high positional accuracy of coordinate pairs within global datasets, even after years of existence.}

We explore the application of this method to a case related to SDG 3 on Health. We document how our approach centered on creating a global academic network designed to engage and empower university students and their faculty mentors to participate in broader efforts to create open, free spatial data on open platforms to inform humanitarian and development objectives outlined by the funding agency, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). This approach expressly links supply and demand for geospatial knowledge by connecting specific needs for geographic information to specific development objectives in targeted places where USAID works to end extreme poverty. We discuss the rationale and context for the methodology as it draws from and builds upon prominent literature of participatory GIS (PGIS) and volunteered geographic information (VGI). We demonstrate how the mapping of building and road infrastructure in Mozambique and Kenya was carried out in order to provide information for an insecticide spray campaign to prevent malaria and protect public health. Throughout these efforts, steps are taken to ensure spatial data quality and to offer opportunities for youth volunteer embeddedness in mapping tasks and themes in places where students otherwise would not engage with real world data or connect with peers from different countries. We reflect on the opportunities and challenges for how this scaled-up “remote participatory sensing” approach to spatial data creation can inform development projects in the context of the SDGs.}

Following a suspected tornadic event, damage surveys are conducted by Environment Canada to determine the extent and severity of damage in order to assign an Enhanced Fujita scale rating. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the process involved in conducting storm damage surveys, and to assess how information gathered during these surveys is used. Primary research for this study involved conducting semi-structured interviews with Environment Canada damage surveyors from various provinces (n=10) and wind engineering researchers from a large public university in Canada (n=2), as well as an onsite observation of a damage survey conducted in Angus, Ontario after a tornado struck on 17 June 2014. The results of this study underscored the subtle but important differences between storm damage surveys conducted in the United States and Canada. It was also found that the majority of damage surveys are now conducted remotely through photos, videos, and telephone interviews with key witnesses. Finally, damage surveys were found to be a critical component of the disaster management cycle by contributing to both risk reduction and preparedness. Introducing sophisticated technologies such as mobile devices and applications, as well as using volunteered geographic information to display damage reports on a web-map, could further improve the damage surveying process in both Canada and abroad.}

While social and environmental justice concerns have been applied to each of these topics individually, this paper addresses VGI, urban forests, and social justice simultaneously. VGI has often been hailed as an empowering and democratic new form of citizen science that allows data collection tasks to be distributed to a large group of people; however, concerns have emerged about whose geographies will be volunteered, and for what purpose. This research addresses these concerns, with an understanding that VGI has the potential to strengthen, rather than dissolve the digital divide. This is accomplished by determining the completeness of coverage of user-generated urban forest mapping on the interactive website PhillyTreeMap (http://www.phillytreemap.org/) by comparing it with high resolution remotely sensed canopy coverage data. These coverage levels are then regressed against Census demographic data at the block group level to determine if there are inequities in the coverage of this urban forest VGI project based upon socioeconomic status. Results indicate that sociodemographic variables influence the likelihood of increased coverage of the VGI urban forest data, presenting equity concerns surrounding the coverage of this VGI urban forest data. The presence of these social and environmental justice concerns indicates the need for expanded research into this new frontier of geographic data. Geographically weighted general linear models show non-stationarity in the relationships between VGI coverage and sociodemographic predictors, demonstrating the importance of incorporating local models.}

Unfortunately, however, social media often lacks geographic metadata or includes geotags that inaccurately reflect the locations of reported events. Toponyms, place names in social media content, provide another source of geographic information yet toponym usage in emergencies remains poorly understood. To address this gap, this study examines toponym usage across 22,343 tweets posted during a severe storm in the Northeastern United States. Tweets were qualitatively coded for nineteen types of storm-related information as well as toponym usage, location reference, and granularity. Findings show that users i) include more geographic information, including toponyms and geotags, in tweets about emergencies than about other topics; ii) report geographically distributed events but tend to include toponyms rather than geotags when reporting local information; and iii) include mostly municipal and regional toponyms in tweets about emergencies but tend to include hyperlocal toponyms and additional municipal or regional markers in reports of infrastructure damage and service disruption. Together these findings offer implications for social sensing applications in emergency response and management. These include more opportunities for course-grained damage assessment than fine-grained situational awareness, and the need for internal and external sources of geographic information to distinguish information about local and remote events. Lastly, findings suggest opportunities for passive and active sensing approaches responsive to the recipient design of social media: users provide additional geographic context that help others distinguish local and remote risks within noisy information spaces that emerge during geographically distributed crises.}

Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) is a process where individuals, supported by enabling technologies, behave like physical sensors to harvest georeferenced content in their surroundings. The value of this, typically heterogeneous, content has been recognized by both researchers and organizations. However, in order to be fruitfully used in various VGI-based types of application reliability and quality of particular VGI content (i.e., Points of Interest) have to be assessed. This evaluation can be based on reputation scores that summarize users’ experiences with the specific content. Following this direction, our contribution provides, primarily, a new comprehensive model and a multi-layer architecture for reputation evaluation aimed to assess quality of VGI content. Secondly, we demonstrate the relevance of adopting such a framework through an applicative scenario for recommending touristic itineraries.}

abstract = {The volunteered geographic information (VGI) gains increasing popularity with the general public and scientific community. However, the optimism about the VGI has been tempered by two critical issues: inequality in data coverage (social justice) and data quality. It therefore requires a better understanding of the mechanism driving VGI contributions and content quality. With a case of China, this paper demonstrates one potential avenue, examining the associations between VGI coverage/quality and local demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. In particular, VGI data are harvested from the OpenStreetMap for 333 cities in China. VGI coverage is measured by the total volume of different geographic features (point, line and polygon); and VGI quality is described from two aspects: completeness and accuracy. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) shows that both demographic and socioeconomic factors have statistically significant influences on VGI coverage and quality. More specifically, densely populous cities with more young, educated and non-agricultural people enjoy higher VGI coverage and quality. Cities with lower VGI coverage and quality are primarily located in the western and southwestern regions where the ethnic minorities concentrate. High VGI coverage and quality are possibly observed in economically developed cities with high marketization degree. Besides, possibility of high VGI coverage and quality occurs in cities with more labor in scientific research and greater percentage of employers in the tertiary industry. The GWR also demonstrates that the strength and nature of the obtained relationships vary across the 333 cities. The spatial non-stationary relationships may partially answer for the controversial empirical conclusions in earlier case studies at different scales. Quantitative analysis (Gini index, Lorenz curve and Moran's I index) further evidences the great inequality in VGI coverage and quality. It can be safely inferred that the differences in engagement and use of VGI, as a new digital divide, can raise troubling concerns on the social justice implications.}

These factors are critical in the process of working with sensitive geographic data in an ethical fashion and ensuring maximum data reliability.

Techniques for collecting, aggregating, and transforming qualitatively mapped data are detailed. Clustering techniques to ready longitudinal recovery metrics for comparison with the participant-derived data are also described.

The datasets are manually labeled for information content and toponym usage. The 22,706 tweet IDs, dehydrated for privacy, are labeled for relevance (storm-related and off-topic) and 19 types of storm-related information organized into six categories: infrastructure damage, service disruption, personal experience, weather updates, weather forecasts, and weather warnings. Data are also labeled for toponym usage (with or without toponyms), location (local, remote, and generic toponyms), and granularity (hyperlocal, municipal, and regional toponyms).

Few studies have explored people's sentiments and perspectives over the process of post-disaster recovery. In this study, a mixed methods approach involving sentiment analysis and Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling is designed for mining sheer volume of tweets about Lombok and Bali, generated by nonlocal Twitter users after a series of earthquakes in the two places in August 2018. The findings mainly suggest that people have generally become less negative about Lombok and Bali over time, despite fluctuations in their sentiment polarities' central tendencies. In addition, dissatisfactions about the housing reconstruction progress, tourism recovery status, and living conditions in the affected areas of Lombok still existed in 2019; contestations have been found with regard to the huge funds for hosting the 2018 Bali IMF-World Bank meeting after the earthquakes. The overall results of this study have proved that the adopted approach can effectively reveal the variations of people's sentiments and perspectives of general and specific issues regarding post-disaster tourism recovery over time.}

abstract = {Integrating both traditional and social media data, this study compares the performance of gravity, neural network, and random forest models of commuting trip distribution in New York City. Trip distribution modeling has primarily employed traditional data sources and classical methods such as the gravity. However, with the emergence of social media during the past decade, the potential for integrating traditional and social media data while utilizing new techniques has been identified. Our findings indicate that the random forest model outperforms the traditional gravity and neural network models. Population, distance, number of Twitter users, and employment were identified as the four most influential predictors of trip distibution by the random forest model. While Twitter flows did not enhance the models' performance, the importance of the number of Twitter users at work destinations implies the potential for using social media data in travel demand modeling to improve the predictive power and accuracy.}

Highly-reliable in-situ location information is critical for rescue efforts during and after disasters, but often such information is not easy or even possible to obtain. The recent technological advancements along with the volunteerism opportunities create the possibility for obtaining the most needed information through citizens via online applications. The paper investigates the role of volunteer crowdsourcing, including its key attributes and relevant technologies, in disaster risk reduction. This study adopts the systematic literature review technique as the methodological approach. The results reveal three major application areas, where the data collection is undertaken through volunteer crowdsourcing—i.e., marketing, communication, disasters. The findings point out to a trend of increasing focus on volunteer crowdsourcing in the disaster risk reduction literature between 2006 and 2018. The study suggests that the adoption of volunteer crowdsourcing systems into practice would assist policymakers and disaster risk managers to make informed decisions before, during and after disasters—hence, could help in reducing risks.}

Unlike Volunteered Geographic Information collection techniques that involve the passive collection of data using location aware devices, the Participatory Geoweb involves the purposeful contribution of location-based information by nonexperts in order to address social and/or environmental issues and to support their inclusion in land related decision-making processes. This growing practice is built on the principles of Participatory Mapping, a well-established methodology that utilizes a range of approaches and techniques including the Participatory Geoweb. Participatory Mapping combines map making with participatory methods to delineate and represent the unique spatial knowledge and lived experiences of local communities. Despite the potential for the Participatory Geoweb to represent a socially or culturally distinct understanding of community spatial knowledge, there remain a number of challenges to both its uptake and efficacy. These challenges include the persistence of the digital divide and the inability of large numbers of people to access the internet with sufficient bandwidth to both view and contribute to the Geoweb; the controversy of data sovereignty and the storage of sometimes sensitive local knowledge in a web-based digital medium; the internet potentially distancing the participants from the immediacy of the issue that the Participatory Geoweb project seeks to address; and the underlying uncertainty and motivations related to the code, algorithms and information displayed on the base maps on which many Participatory Geoweb applications are built.}

The methodology uses publicly available volunteer geographic information, compiled in a spatial database with places (tracks) where these activities occur, in order to measure the use intensity. Results show: (1) the rate of biker and runner compliance with the park's trails, and (2) places where potential conflicts among users are likely to happen. Profiling user's preferences can help managers and decision makers to design proper infrastructure for outdoor activities. Strategic management errors can be avoided by knowing user preferences in urban parks, and by offering improved conditions which meet the expectations and needs of different user groups.
Management implications
This paper presents an efficient method to detect spatial overlaps between different recreational activities which is useful when financial and personnel resources for monitoring visitors in recreational urban green areas are scarce. The dataset comprises Volunteer Geographic Information, publicly available through web sharing services. It constitutes an alternative or a complementary data base compared to direct survey methods. The study revealed the suitability of this methodological approach for the two most popular outdoor recreation activities within urban parks – mountain biking and running.}

These practices are enabled by an array of spatial and digital technologies that also facilitate the growth of the so-called volunteered geographic information (VGI) regarding contributions from users without training in conventional GIS or cartography. In the growing body of work on VGI, however, not much attention has been given to the emergence of such sound maps as part of the VGI constructions. Meanwhile, research in soundscape has not addressed the aspect of crowd-sourcing or user-generated contributions facilitated by new information and communication technologies. This article seeks to bridge this gap. It draws upon important insights from critical GIS research into investigating VGI as visual practices, while it is also informed by three areas of soundscape research including mapping soundscapes, tracing the production of soundscapes and exploring embodied experiences with soundscapes. Through an empirical case in China, this article suggests a two-level analytical framework: investigating in what ways crowd-sourced sound maps emerge and interpreting these sounds on their shared platforms. In so doing, this study calls for more engagement with the multi-modality aspect of visuality in mappings, which in turn may have implications for landscape design and planning. In this way, it seeks to enrich the discussion on critical visualization.}

However, more than a technical feature, VGI has brought to light the political aspects of cartography, when multiple stakeholders have access to mapping tools. This is the case of the collaborative mapping strategies used to map North Korea, one of the most, if not the most, closed countries in the world in terms of diplomatic relations, tourism and its economy. OpenStreetMap (OSM) enables “armchair mappers” to map opaque territories in which local governments control citizens’ access to the internet. In this paper, we discuss the following questions: Who is mapping North Korea in OSM? Which tools and methods do contributors use to gain access to information about the country and to represent it? What are the motivations behind this mapping endeavor? We analyze technical aspects of OSM data for North Korea and structured correspondence exchanged with 889 contributors. We argue that crowdsourced efforts can make good the dearth of knowledge resulting from the physical, cultural and political barriers associated with uncharted territories and that, although the motivations for such efforts vary greatly, they all have their origin in a sense of empathy and the power technology has to penetrate geopolitical barriers.}

This can be provided by Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) which are a low-cost means of collecting updated information about rivers. Another valuable resource is Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) which is a comparatively new means of improving the coverage of monitored areas because it is able to supply supplementary information to the WSN and thus support decision-making in flood risk management. However, there still remains the problem of how to combine WSN data with VGI. In this paper, an attempt is made to investigate AGORA-DS, which is a Spatial Decision Support System (SDSS) that is able to make flood risk management more effective by combining these data sources, i.e. WSN with VGI. This approach is built over a conceptual model that complies with the interoperable standards laid down by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) – e.g. Sensor Observation Service (SOS) and Web Feature Service (WFS) – and seeks to combine and present unified information in a web-based decision support tool. This work was deployed in a real scenario of flood risk management in the town of São Carlos in Brazil. The evidence obtained from this deployment confirmed that interoperable standards can support the integration of data from distinct data sources. In addition, they also show that VGI is able to provide information about areas of the river basin which lack data since there is no appropriate station in the area. Hence it provides a valuable support for the WSN data. It can thus be concluded that AGORA-DS is able to combine information provided by WSN and VGI, and provide useful information for supporting flood risk management.}

Annual census of this species started in 1991. It usually took one observer 1–2 months to complete the census and even then, it was not logistically reasonable to include some areas with very steep slope in the core of the protected area. In order to bypass these constraints, an alternative and ambitious monitoring scheme that would allow estimating the whole species throughout its entire range was proposed in 2007. The new scheme, which complemented and improved previous estimates, consisted in performing a thorough instantaneous census using a distance sampling approach, thus allowing a detailed snapshot of effective occupation, density, habitat preferences and distribution range of the Azores Bullfinch. The Priolo Atlas turned into a volunteered geographic information and citizen science-based ornithological initiative which every 4 years congregates more than 50 well-trained volunteers in the Azores. With the first two editions (2008 and 2012), this initiative has already established itself as a critical tool to monitor the population of this endemic species.}

This analysis uses VGI describing land cover that was captured using a web-based interface, linked to Google Earth. A number of control points, for which the land cover had been determined by experts allowed measures of the reliability of each volunteer in relation to each land cover class to be calculated. Geographically weighted kernels were used to estimate surfaces of volunteered land cover information accuracy and then to develop spatially distributed correspondences between the volunteer land cover class and land cover from 3 contemporary global datasets (GLC-2000, GlobCover and MODIS v.5). Specifically, a geographically weighted approach calculated local confusion matrices (correspondences) at each location in a central African study area and generated spatial distributions of user's, producer's, portmanteau, and partial portmanteau accuracies. These were used to evaluate the global datasets and to infer which of them was ‘best’ at describing Tree cover at each location in the study area. The resulting maps show where specific global datasets are recommended for analyses requiring Tree cover information. The methods presented in this research suggest that some of the concerns about the quality of VGI can be addressed through careful data collection, the use of control points to evaluate volunteer performance and spatially explicit analyses. A research agenda for the use and analysis of VGI about land cover is outlined.}

In this paper, we present the GeoCONAVI (Geographic CONtext Analysis for Volunteered Information) approach and a prototype system, designed to retrieve, process, analyze and evaluate social media content on forest fires, producing relevant, credible and actionable VGI usable for crisis events. The novelty of the approach lies in the enrichment of the content with additional geographic context information, and use of spatio-temporal clustering to support scoring and validation. Thus, the system is focusing on integrating authoritative data sources with VGI. Evaluation in case studies shows that the prototype system can handle large amounts of data with common-off-the-shelf hardware, produces valuable results, and is adaptable to other types of crisis events.}

With recent advances in activity-based land use, transportation, and environment (LUTE) models, such disaggregated land use data become important to allow LUTE models to analyze and simulate a person’s choices of work location and activity destinations and to understand policy impacts on future cities. These data can also be used as alternatives to explore economic activities at the local level, especially as government-published census-based disaggregated employment data have become less available in the recent decade. Our new approach provides opportunities for cities to estimate land use at high resolution with low cost by utilizing VGI while ensuring its quality with a certain accuracy threshold. The automatic classification of POI can also be utilized for other types of analyses on cities.}

abstract = {Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) offers a potentially inexpensive source of reference data for estimating area and assessing map accuracy in the context of remote-sensing based land-cover monitoring. The quality of observations from VGI and the typical lack of an underlying probability sampling design raise concerns regarding use of VGI in widely-applied design-based statistical inference. This article focuses on the fundamental issue of sampling design used to acquire VGI. Design-based inference requires the sample data to be obtained via a probability sampling design. Options for incorporating VGI within design-based inference include: 1) directing volunteers to obtain data for locations selected by a probability sampling design; 2) treating VGI data as a “certainty stratum” and augmenting the VGI with data obtained from a probability sample; and 3) using VGI to create an auxiliary variable that is then used in a model-assisted estimator to reduce the standard error of an estimate produced from a probability sample. The latter two options can be implemented using VGI data that were obtained from a non-probability sampling design, but require additional sample data to be acquired via a probability sampling design. If the only data available are VGI obtained from a non-probability sample, properties of design-based inference that are ensured by probability sampling must be replaced by assumptions that may be difficult to verify. For example, pseudo-estimation weights can be constructed that mimic weights used in stratified sampling estimators. However, accuracy and area estimates produced using these pseudo-weights still require the VGI data to be representative of the full population, a property known as “external validity”. Because design-based inference requires a probability sampling design, directing volunteers to locations specified by a probability sampling design is the most straightforward option for use of VGI in design-based inference. Combining VGI from a non-probability sample with data from a probability sample using the certainty stratum approach or the model-assisted approach are viable alternatives that meet the conditions required for design-based inference and use the VGI data to advantage to reduce standard errors.}

abstract = {Current implementations of gazetteers, geographic directories that associate place names to geographic coordinates, cannot use semantics to answer complex queries (most gazetteers are just thesauri of place names), use domain ontologies for place name disambiguation, make their data sets available in the Semantic Web or support the use of Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI). A new generation of gazetteers has to tackle these problems. In this paper, we present a new architecture for gazetteers that uses VGI and Semantic Web tools, such as ontologies and Linked Open Data to overcome these limitations. We also present a gazetteer, the Semantic Web Interactive Gazetteer (SWI), implemented using this architecture, and show that it can be used to add absent geographic coordinates to biodiversity records. In our tests, we use this gazetteer to correct geographic data from a big sample (around 142,000 occurrence records of Amazonian specimens) from SpeciesLink, a big repository of biodiversity collection records from Brazil. The tests showed that the SWI Gazetteer was able to add geographic coordinates to around 30,000 records, increasing the records with coordinates from 30.29% to 57.5% of the total number of records in the sample (representing an increase of 90%).}
