abstract = {Engaging the community in Early Warning Systems (EWSs) plays an essential role in saving lives, reducing injuries, and limiting environmental damage associated with disaster events. However, EWSs have traditionally focused on technology and infrastructure with the absence of comprehensive engagement with the community across the four EWS elements of risk knowledge, monitoring, dissemination and communication and response capability. Subsequently, past experience shows inappropriate responses by communities during disasters. This study reviews definitions, concepts and evolution of EWSs, and the applicability of Community Engagement (CE) in EWSs. It aims to systematically review how the community is engaged in the four elements of EWSs using evidence from the literature sourced from peer-reviewed articles and grey literature. From a total of 4211 initial documents sourced from 2008 to 2018, 31 documents (15 peer-reviewed journal articles and 16 grey literature from project reports) were finally selected to review after an extensive screening process. Of the 31 documents, most of them were from Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) especially the Asian region, followed by the African region. The findings indicate inadequate CE across the four EWS elements (dominating in the risk knowledge element with a single hazard focus). Identified key issues included challenges for sustainability of CE in EWSs, inadequate integration of local and scientific knowledge into EWS design and operation and insufficient consideration of the full range of vulnerable groups in the system. More systematic and sustained efforts are required to improve CE in all EWS elements in order to achieve more effective disaster response.}

This local elevation in temperatures could potentially impact upon local energy consumption, with residents in the warmer central section of the city using more energy to cool their homes in summer and less energy to warm them in winter. This study uses a combination of Geographical Information System techniques and Remote Sensing data (MODIS LST and NDVI), as a preliminary investigation, to assess the spatial relationship between UHI, urban greenspace, household income and electricity consumption in Birmingham, UK. It provides simple and repeatable steps, based on freely available datasets, for urban planners, industry, human and physical geographers, and non-specialists to reproduce the analyses. The results show that, the present impact of the UHI is limited and instead highlights the dominance of household income over local climate in explaining consumption patterns across Birmingham.}

The perception and behavioral characteristics of people derived from crowdsourced data, such as social media and mobile phone signaling data, can provide information sources for disaster assessment and assist disaster emergency management. This topic has attracted extensive attention from scholars. However, these data types are incomplete and have wide-ranging quality, which makes it difficult to evaluate the disaster. Social media data contain many public descriptions of disasters, but the spatial distribution is uneven. Mobile phone signaling data cover a wide range and are spatiotemporal continuous, but semantic information is lacking. Thus, this paper develops a disaster impact assessment method that integrates social media data and mobile signaling data based on a classification of social media data with a character-level convolutional neural network (Char-CNN), anomaly detection in mobile signaling data, and feature mining of human activity. The result shows that social media and mobile signaling data complement each other well. The proposed method improves the assessment accuracy and provides detailed information on the spatial distribution of disasters. The results of this study provide reference for the combination of different sources of information for disaster response decisions.}

abstract = {The research will analyse various types of land use and occupation within the territory of the Lençóis Maranhenses National Park and the surrounding area. It is a challenging environment, because the region is very low lying and the soil is sandy; further, acceleration in climate change and rising water levels will also have severe impact on the land and the peoples. The population is diverse, and includes many minority groups. At this time, the key subsistence activities of the people include fishing and fruit collecting; some also herd goats and sheep, and grow crops; and others engage in tourism and produce handcrafts for sale. The use of geotechnologies, and the creation of a Cybercartographic Atlas, together with a participatory and interdisciplinary approach to research, can together contribute to a deeper understanding of the nature of land use in this region, and thus contribute profoundly to improving the quality of life of the local people. The main objective of this chapter will be to examine the work and methodology used on the Cybercartographic Atlas for Lençóis Maranhenses National Park, as well as to incorporate and encourage participation not only by the academic-scientific sector but also by land administrators and the local population, particularly those who live within Lençóis Maranhenses and its sphere of influence. In the future, it is expected that this inclusive methodological approach to research can be applied in other regions in Brazil where there are comparable socio-environmental conflicts impacting minority groups; for example, indigenous populations, communities of ‘quilombolas’ (descendants of slaves), ‘caiçaras’ (seashore population) and others.}

Throughout time, environmental researchers have been using different tools and methods to determine and record location/description of observations with all limitations on their use. Lately, more and more common digital methods and new technologies have been gaining interest and popularity within the environmental science community. Among those technologies there are mobile mapping devices and applications which have been gaining audience in recent time. dedicated Handheld devices such as consumer-grade GPS (Global Positioning System) dedicated for tourism purposes have been substituted by smartphones and tablets with integrated GPS receiver so that field mapping became much easier and more readily available to a broader audience. Although the possibility of using mobile devices and dedicated applications for field mapping has an increasing trend, there is very little attention dedicated to them in methodology sections of research works. The purpose of this paper is to bring further awareness about such technologies to environmental researchers as they could benefit from using dedicated software available for mobile devices. Such software could ameliorate their workflow, accuracy and quality of data, which can help to achieve better research results. We briefly present our review result of mobile applications for field mapping as the first global overview within scientific journals. The review includes environmental citizen science apps as a particular example of data collection applications. The comprehensive description of workspace creation for field surveys using ArcGIS Online (Esri, 2019) and Collector for ArcGIS (Esri, 2019a) is presented in this work.

Prior research pointed out that there exist two distinct subpopulations in cities, namely returners and explorers, whose mobility patterns differ in the extent to which their characteristic traveled distance is impacted by their recurrent mobility. However, the potential dependence of the returners and explorers dichotomy on the observation duration has been largely ignored in prior research, which may cause biased understanding of the returners and explorers dichotomy in urban mobility patterns. By analyzing the daily trajectory data of 21,240 individuals in Guangzhou over 111 weekdays, this study evidenced that the returners and explorers dichotomy is significantly dependent on the duration within which individuals’ trajectories are observed. This study further revealed that such dependence could be interpreted by three underlying explanations, which are respectively related to information accumulation, individuals’ spatial exploration behaviors and changes in individuals’ important locations. The findings provide fundamental knowledge for studying urban human mobility patterns for disease prediction, population behavioral modeling, and understanding dynamic human-environment interactions at urban scales.}

In 2014, we conducted a PPGIS study to identify public land values in Victoria, Australia. Over 35,000 landscape value and land use preference locations were mapped by study participants (n = 1905). We analyzed the spatial data for association with public land type, IUCN classification, and an agency level management system. We generated social landscape metrics to quantify values by individual public land units based on value abundance, richness, diversity, and the potential for management conflict. We found statistically significant associations between values and public land type, IUCN protected area classification, and management level of protection. The social landscape metrics indicate that the most highly valued public lands (national parks) have the greatest potential for management conflict, but also reveal several less iconic public lands as having high potential for management conflict. We discuss the strengths and limitations of the PPGIS methods in the study and provide suggestions to improve the process for future assessments of social and cultural values associated with public lands.}

Thus, social media has become a very prominent data source to obtain data and contextual information. Recently, cities are exposed to a variety of challenges such as health care, environment, energy consumption, traffic congestion, housing, education, public safety, budgets, economic development, demographics, diversity, and inclusiveness. So, technological advances bear the promise of addressing many of these challenges. At this point, the feedback from the citizens and city inhabitants is needed to collaborate voluntarily with observations about their surrounding environment. Thus, the technology plays an important role to offer solutions essentially fostering the civic participation. This chapter is focused on examining this particular issue, taking into consideration data from social media that can assist governments and organizations to better understand various phenomena massively and nearly to real time. A framework for urban analysis based on civic participation is proposed, in which social media posts are used to explicitly describe geographic features and events as well as spatial relationships that include time stamps and geolocation data. On the other hand, to highlight the advantage of the framework, a geographic information system–approach is considered, emphasizing aspects related to the data quality, where the diversity of criteria applied by users in the data acquisition is presented. As a case study, Twitter was chosen as the social media for its common use in scientific and commercial data analysis.}

Such financial tools are intended to promote fast payouts in the aftermath of a disastrous event. They leverage on measured hazard parameters, gathered immediately after the event and defined as the trigger(s), which are used to identify such hazardous events and estimate their resulting consequences in terms of physical damage and losses. This paper addresses the first step of such a modeling approach, the detection of a flood event, which plays an important role in the overall methodology, determining its performance in terms of false and missed detections. Different types of triggers for identifying flood events, based on satellite precipitation estimates, are investigated, and the overall model performance is assessed for a case-study country (the Philippines). A statistical procedure for selecting the optimal configuration of model parameters is presented. Such an optimal configuration minimizes the so-called basis risk, defined in this study as the mismatch between modeled and actual events. Finally, the accuracy of the proposed approach in terms of event localization is investigated by subdividing the case-study country into three main areas, corresponding to the coarsest administrative levels, and assessing the model's capability to capture events in each considered area. The results from this study confirm that the proposed SPEED model can be effectively used as an input for parametric insurance products, given its ability to identify hazardous events correctly.}

A dearth of national-scale assessments in the Global South has precluded the ability to explore how political regimes, such as the forced racial segregation in South Africa during and after Apartheid, have influenced the extent of and access to green infrastructure over time. We investigate whether there are disparities in green infrastructure distributions across race and income geographies in urban South Africa. Using open-source satellite imagery and geographic information, along with national census statistics, we find that public and private green infrastructure is more abundant, accessible, greener and more treed in high-income relative to low-income areas, and in areas where previously advantaged racial groups (i.e. White citizens) reside. Areas with White residents report 6-fold higher income, have 11.7% greater tree cover, 8.9% higher vegetation greenness and live 700 m closer to a public park than areas with predominantly Black African, Indian, and Coloured residents. The inequity in neighborhood greenness levels has been maintained (for Indian and Coloured areas) and further entrenched (for Black African areas) since the end of Apartheid in 1994 across the country. We also find that these spatial inequities are mirrored in both private (gardens) and public (street verges, parks, green belts) spaces, hinting at the failure of governance structures to plan for and implement urban greening initiatives. By leveraging open-access satellite data and methods presented here, there is scope for civil society to monitor urban green infrastructure over time and thereby hold governments accountable to addressing environmental justice imperatives in the future.

We examined the art and science of multi-scale citizen science support, focusing on issues of integration and flexibility that arise for data management when programs span multiple spatial, temporal, and social scales across many domains. Our objectives were to: (1) briefly review existing citizen science approaches and data management needs; (2) propose a framework for multi-scale citizen science support; (3) develop a cyber-infrastructure to support citizen science program needs; and (4) describe lessons learned. We find that approaches differ in scope, scale, and activities and that the proposed framework situates programs while guiding cyber-infrastructure system development. We built a cyber-infrastructure support system for citizen science programs (www.citsci.org) and show that carefully designed systems can be adept enough to support programs at multiple spatial and temporal scales across many domains when built with a flexible architecture. The advantage of a flexible, yet controlled, cyber-infrastructure system lies in the ability of users with different levels of permission to easily customize the features themselves, while adhering to controlled vocabularies necessary for cross-discipline comparisons and meta-analyses. Program evaluation tied to this framework and integrated into cyber-infrastructure support systems will improve our ability to track effectiveness. We compare existing systems and discuss the importance of standards for interoperability and the challenges associated with system maintenance and long-term support.

abstract = {Sinkholes are one of the major geohazards in karst areas, causing loss of life and significant economic loss as well. Sinkhole forming mechanism varies depending on the geological environment, and Florida's sinkholes are formed through the process of interaction between groundwater flow and cover soils. The significance of this paper is (1) to identify key sinkhole contributing factors and (2) to quantify the impact of those factors on sinkhole formation. Particularly, this study accounted for geomechanical factors that contribute to sinkhole raveling (due to erosion) and mechanical stability of overburden soils. Identification of key sinkhole contributing factors will allow developing a probabilistic sinkhole prediction model. The study area was focused on East Central Florida, where cover-collapse sinkholes often occur. Uniform-distribution transformation was employed for the quantitative analysis on each factor, and then case studies with specific examples are then presented to validate the results of the quantitative analysis. In conclusion, the identified key factors are hydraulic head difference, soil permeability, thicknesses of aquifer systems, and proximity to karst features (e.g., existing sinkhole). The critical permeability (kcrit) showing a rapid increase of sinkhole occurrence is about 20 cm/h. Thickness and characteristics of cover soils seem a controlling factor of sinkhole types, and the overburden thickness around 40 to 45 m tends to form the collapse type. A multivariate regression analysis indicates that the thickness of the surficial aquifer system is the most significant factor, and then the head difference and the proximity to karst features follow in order.}

In this paper we quantified the temporal dynamics of socio-economic vulnerability, expressed as fatalities over exposed population and losses over exposed GDP, to climate-related hazards between 1980 and 2016. Using a global, spatially explicit framework that integrates population and economic dynamics with one of the most complete natural disaster loss databases we quantified mortality and loss rates across income levels and analyzed their relationship with wealth. Results show a clear decreasing trend in both human and economic vulnerability, with global average mortality and economic loss rates that have dropped by 6.5 and nearly 5 times, respectively, from 1980–1989 to 2007–2016. We further show a clear negative relation between vulnerability and wealth, which is strongest at the lowest income levels. This has led to a convergence in vulnerability between higher and lower income countries. Yet, there is still a considerable climate hazard vulnerability gap between poorer and richer countries.}

Crowdsourcing and social media are widely used in disaster response, yet their primary implementation and application are often via non-governmental agencies and private citizens. A review of the literature suggests that government emergency management agencies in Canada have made little documented progress in adopting crowdsourcing or social media for emergency management. Most of the literature around crowdsourcing and social media for emergency management focus on its use or role outside of Canada (e.g. the USA, Australia, etc.). In order for government agencies in Canada to progress, it is important to identify the Canada-specific barriers and constraints. This study offers a new perspective from Canadian government emergency management agencies to address this gap. Through a series of semi-structured interviews with 15 government officials from 14 agencies, this study identifies the primary challenges and constraints faced by Canadian agencies looking to adopt crisis crowdsourcing. Results indicate that organizational factors, policies, and federal legislation in Canada present barriers to crisis crowdsourcing (including crowdsourcing through social media) adoption within agencies at various levels of government. Based on these results, recommendations are made to support the adoption of crisis crowdsourcing amongst Canadian government agencies.}

abstract = {Urbanization is currently one of the most profound transformations taking place across the globe influencing the flows of people, energy, and matter. The urban form influences and is influenced by these flows and is therefore critical in understanding and how urban areas affect and are affected by form. Nevertheless, there is a lack of uniformity in how urban form is analyzed. Urban form analyzed from a continuum of a simple urban versus non-urban classification to highly detailed representations of land use and land cover. Either end of the representation spectrum limits the ability to analyze within-urban dynamics, to make cross-city comparisons, and to produce generalizable results. In the framework of remote sensing and geospatial analysis, we identify and define six fundamental aspects of urban form, which are organized within three overarching components. Materials, or the physical elements of the urban landscape, consists of three aspects (1) human constructed elements, (2) the soil-plant continuum, and (3) water elements. The second component is configuration, which includes the (4) two- and three-dimensional space and (5) spatial pattern of urban areas. Lastly, because of the dynamics of human activities and biophysical processes, an important final component is the change of urban form over (6) time. We discuss how a this urban form framework integrates into a broader discussion of urbanization.}

In many cases, data used for these purposes have low spatial and temporal resolution, or sample size. Equally, comprehensive analytical approaches suitable for these data may be lacking. We present a statistical method borrowed from wildlife ecology and management called a resource selection function (RSF). We apply it to answer questions relating to the selection of urban green space by university students, using a dataset consisting of smartphone GPS location data volunteered by participants. We ask questions relating to urban greenspace selection by comparing used locations to a set of random locations at multiple spatial extents. We found that participants altered their selection of areas according to the surrounding recreational trail density and whether those areas were classified as green space. These relationships were also influenced by season. Our study also demonstrates how the design of an urban RSF can offer different insights by varying the extent of the domain: (1) to an individual’s core area; or (2) by excluding from the domain areas that are physically unavailable. We emphasize the importance of matching availability to the research question and conclude by reviewing the opportunities presented by using RSFs combined with GPS location data in an urban context. We argue that RSFs have utility beyond wildlife ecology and management, and, given the increasing availability of smartphone GPS data, can successfully be applied to determine the use and selection of spaces by urban residents.}

Disaster evacuation drills are one of the important soft countermeasures to ensure proper response when a real tsunami arrives. With the goal of enhancing the traditional evacuation drill, this study developed a mobile application prototype to be used as an educational tool in a drill exercise. The mobile application retrieves the current location of the user and shows the inundation depth of the 2011 Great East Japan tsunami, together with the map, latitude, and longitude. Experiments were conducted in the town of Matsushima and the city of Iwanuma in Miyagi Prefecture, Japan, to investigate the effect of using the information provided. These locations were affected by the 2011 tsunami. The results revealed a change in the behavior and decision making of the participants, who considered the inundation depth of their evacuation route and the safety of their chosen destination. This application does not require complex techniques; thus, teachers, drill executors, and community leaders can follow this strategy to enhance their tsunami evacuation drills using mobile devices.}

Consequently, for such a case, information about each individual destination on a more detailed spatial level is needed. This information can be gathered manually or, if available, through the classical approach from public authorities. However, these approaches are often time consuming and expensive. An alternative way is to gather the information automatically from open data portals. Open-StreetMap (OSM) is such an open data portal driven by volunteers. The data is publicly available, but as volunteers provide it, the quality of the data is not controlled by a single instance. Therefore, we analyze the potential and risks of using OSM as a data source for microscopic destination choice models. Our analysis took place in the city of Karlsruhe. We analyzed the available information for destinations regarding the education and work activity type. Our analysis is split into two parts. Firstly, we analyzed the trend of the information available on OSM over the last years. Secondly, we compared the currently available information for one area of Karlsruhe. By comparing OSM data with manually gathered data, we show that for the education activity type, OSM data is suitable to determine location attributes, whereas, for the work activity type, OSM data is still lacking and therefore not suitable to determine location attributes.}

However, such areas, due to the high population density, sub-standard housing and lack of essential services are urban risks. The socio-physical development of such settlements has often been neglected due to poor laws and provisions in urban management and policies. One of the primary reasons for negligence has been the unavailability of slum maps to study the evolution of slums and to actively manage and contain them. Various remote sensing techniques have been utilized to answer the problem but have not produced universal solutions. In recent years, Deep Learning (DL) techniques with remote sensing have been found beneficial in comprehending the underlying structure of physical features present in the satellite imageries. This study deals with one of the Deep Learning techniques which use pre-trained convolutional networks for slum detection in Very High Resolution (VHR) and Medium Resolution (MR) satellite imagery. We created a training dataset which comprises of four classes including slums, built, green and water. We further trained the model to detect these classes in the entire city. Classification performance was evaluated for Very high and Medium Resolution imagery with the help of manually delineated slum boundaries gathered from urban local authorities of Mumbai. The Overall accuracy of 94.2 and 90.2 and kappa of 0.70 and 0.55 is obtained from VHR and MR imagery respectively. We provide a comprehensive technique for the detection of informal settlements which can be tailored and applied to any city to detect various landforms.}

Our aims are the following: to provide an overview of existing CES evaluation methods, to classify them, to analyze them, to highlight important challenges and to offer suggestions for future study. This study has reviewed 293 papers and identified 20 evaluation methods. To conclude, we (i) emphasize considering all CES categories. More specifically, consistent classification systems for CES and unambiguous descriptions of each category are needed; (ii) highlight a combination of methods to enable a better evaluation of CES and call for integrating monetary and non-monetary methods, which does not indicate merely adding the different parts but rather focusing on the interactions between these components, especially by means of deliberative, participatory and mapping techniques; (iii) encourage more stated preference methods, such as the Q-method and narratives, to evaluate neglected services; (iv) propose that in-depth study of CES evaluation process is required to improve evaluation accuracy.}

Energy system models need to tackle this issue by improving modelling resolution and scope. To allow for such modelling, more and better input datasets are needed on variable renewable energy potentials and yields. These need to be of global scope, of sufficient spatial and temporal resolution, and generated with transparent, consistent methods. This study develops the methods and applies it to generate these datasets at subnational and hourly resolution. The assessment is carried out for wind and solar technologies with consistent constraints including geographical, social and economic aspects. Features from the OpenStreetMap are converted into land cover and land use datasets and applied. Hourly energy output is simulated using NASA MERRA-2 meteorological datasets, reconciled with resource maps from the Global Wind Atlas and Global Solar Atlas platforms. Capacity supply curves are provided for 731 terrestrial zones and 339 offshore zones worldwide, along with corresponding hourly output profiles over a 10-year simulation period. The proposed energy potentials are relative conservative compared with other studies. The datasets can serve as input for regional or global energy system models when analyzing high variable renewable energy shares.}

We use the Weka and ARIES software to produce two examples of DDM: firewood use in South Africa and biodiversity value in Sicily, respectively. Our South African example demonstrates that DDM (64–91% accuracy) can identify the areas where firewood use is within the top quartile with comparable accuracy as conventional modelling techniques (54–77% accuracy). The Sicilian example highlights how DDM can be made more accessible to decision makers, who show both capacity and willingness to engage with uncertainty information. Uncertainty estimates, produced as part of the DDM process, allow decision makers to determine what level of uncertainty is acceptable to them and to use their own expertise for potentially contentious decisions. We conclude that DDM has a clear role to play when modelling ecosystem services, helping produce interdisciplinary models and holistic solutions to complex socio-ecological issues.}

Hence an advanced tool is required to filter such massive data and mine the valuable information. Recommender systems are among the most excellent tools for such a purpose in which collaborative filtering is widely used. Collaborative filtering (CF) has been extensively utilized to offer personalized recommendations in electronic business and social network websites. In that, matrix factorization is an efficient technique; however, it depends on past transactions of the users. Hence, there will be a data sparsity problem. Another issue with the collaborative filtering method is the cold start issue, which is due to the deficient information about new entities. A novel method is proposed to overcome the data sparsity and the cold start problem in CF. For cold start issue, Recommender System with Linked Open Data (RS-LOD) model is designed and for data sparsity problem, Matrix Factorization model with Linked Open Data is developed (MF-LOD). A LOD knowledge base “DBpedia” is used to find enough information about new entities for a cold start issue, and an improvement is made on the matrix factorization model to handle data sparsity. Experiments were done on Netflix and MovieLens datasets show that our proposed techniques are superior to other existing methods, which mean recommendation accuracy is improved.}

Temporal evolution of social media activities was investigated to track the process of the disaster, and further compared with observed precipitation data. Moreover, major impacts of the disaster were assessed through word frequency analysis of impact-related topics. Finally, place-related information were extracted to map the hotspots of the disaster. The results indicate that temporal variation of social media activities was consistent with the rainstorm process and significant positive correlation was found between social media activities and precipitation intensity. Word frequency analysis of impact-related topics revealed that transportation and daily life were most affected, meanwhile impacts on people's emotion and psychological activities were also notable. For hot spots affected by the disaster, more flooded sites were found in central urban districts, which are generally residential/industrial area or roads and other traffic-related places. This study demonstrated the utility of social media for disaster assessment, however ensuring the accuracy of online information and expanding the application for all phases of disaster management still pose substantial challenges for future research.}

This chapter presents a critical assessment to rethink the impact that peer-to-peer accommodation networks have on place experiences and placemaking, focusing on three themes: (a) the urban ecosystem, (b) place authenticity and “localhood,” and (c) a city’s diversity advantage. As a way to illustrate our argument and to ground it in an empirical case, we introduce firsthand place and tourism experiences from the city of Split in Croatia. We synthesize our argument across the three themes with a view to expand transdisciplinary knowledge into urban studies and smart cities. The chapter concludes with emerging recommendations for placemaking approaches, policy, and regulatory reform as well as industry and platform innovation.}

When LBSN is built using stay points, it presents much more information since GPS logs convey more users' mobility information. However, the main challenge in building LBSN using stay points is to define local-vertices. This problem is known as local-entity resolution. This local-vertices could represent venues with semantic information like parks, restaurants, among others. The most common way to resolve local-entity is by applying clustering algorithms to group nearby stay points into local-vertices. However, in this case, only geographic information is used, which makes it very difficult to separate geographically close venues into distinct local-vertices. This paper addresses this gap and presents a novel approach that uses the coarsening stage of a multilevel optimization scheme to build LBSNs by using stay points. The experimental evaluation carried out indicates that our approach has advantages compared to usual clustering methods to represent real-world features.}

abstract = {Various fields have widely used place emotion extracted from social networking sites (SNS) information in recent years. However, the emotional information may contain biases as users are a particular subset of the whole population. This research studies whether there are significant differences between place emotion extracted from SNS and the place in-situ (a campus of Wuhan University). Two datasets from different sources, Weibo (a platform similar to twitter) and in-situ cameras, are collected over the same time periods in the same geographical range. By utilizing online cognitive services on the photos collected, the diversity of people with a recognizable face in terms of age, gender, and emotions are determined. The results suggest that there are significant differences in place emotion extracted from Weibo and in-situ. Furthermore, the pattern of differences varies among diverse demographic groups. This paper quantitatively contrasts place emotion extracted from SNS and the place in-situ, which can help researchers achieve a more profound understanding of human behavior differences between online and offline place emotion. This research also provides a theoretical basis to calibrate the emotion metrics obtained from SNS facial expressions on future place emotion studies.}

abstract = {Use of Public Participation Geographic Information System (PPGIS) for data collection has been significantly growing over the past few years in different areas of research and practice. With the growing amount of data, there is little doubt that a potentially wider community can benefit from open access to them. Additionally, open data add to the transparency of research and can be considered as an essential feature of science. However, data anonymization is a complex task and the unique characteristics of PPGIS add to this complexity. PPGIS data often include personal spatial and non-spatial information, which essentially require different approaches for anonymization. In this study, we first identify different privacy concerns and then develop a PPGIS data anonymization strategy to overcome them for an open PPGIS data. Specifically, this article introduces a context-sensitive spatial anonymization method to protect individual home locations while maintaining their spatial resolution for mapping purposes. Furthermore, this study empirically evaluates the effects of data anonymization on PPGIS data quality. The results indicate that a satisfactory level of anonymization can be reached using this approach. Moreover, the assessment results indicate that the environmental and home range measurements as well as their intercorrelations are not significantly biased by the anonymization. However, necessary analytical measures such as use of larger spatial units is recommendable when anonymized data is used. In this study, European data protection regulations were used as the legal guidelines. However, adaptation of methods employed in this study may be also relevant to other countries where comparable regulations exist. Although specifically targeted at PPGIS data, what is discussed in this paper can be applicable to other similar spatial datasets as well.}

We compare several pre-processing schemes (PS) for LUCAS data and propose a new PS for a fully automated classification of satellite imagery on the national level. The image data utilizes a high-dimensional Sentinel-2-based image feature space. Key elements of LUCAS data pre-processing include two positioning approaches and three semantic selection approaches. The latter approaches differ in the applied quality measures for identifying valid reference points and by the number of LU/LC classes (7–12). In an iterative training process, the impact of the chosen PS on a Random Forest image classifier is evaluated. The results are compared to LUCAS reference points that are not pre-processed, which act as a benchmark, and the classification quality is evaluated by independent sets of validation points. The classification results show that the positional correction of LUCAS points has an especially positive effect on the overall classification accuracy. On average, this improves the accuracy by 3.7%. This improvement is lowest for the most rigid sample selection approach, PS2, and highest for the benchmark data set, PS0. The highest overall accuracy is 93.1% which is achieved by using the newly developed PS3; all PS achieve overall accuracies of 80% and higher on average. While the difference in overall accuracy between the PS is likely to be influenced by the respective number of LU/LC classes, we conclude that, overall, LUCAS in-situ data is a suitable source for reference information for large scale high resolution LC mapping using Sentinel-2 imagery. Existing sample selection approaches developed for Landsat imagery can be transferred to Sentinel-2 imagery, achieving comparable semantic accuracies while increasing the spatial resolution. The resulting LC classification product that uses the newly developed PS is available for Germany via DOI: https://doi.org/10.15489/1ccmlap3mn39.}

abstract = {The Lesser Sunda Seascape (LSS) is considered one of the regions with the largest mobulid fisheries in Indonesia, although their spatial distribution and habitat preference in the LSS is still largely unknown. The goal of the present study was to describe the habitat preference and distribution of the oceanic manta rays, spinetail devil rays, and Chilean devil rays in the coastal area of LSS. We used multiple data sources of mobulid ray sightings and selected significant environmental predictors to execute the maximum entropy model. The model performed well in predicting mobulid ray habitat in the coastal area of LSS and indicated that sea-surface chlorophyll-a (SSC-a), sea-surface temperature (SST), sea-surface salinity (SSS), distance to the 200-m isobath, distance to the 3000-m isobath, and slope were all significant environmental predictors of their distribution. This study confirms that the habitat preference of mobulid rays were in the areas that close to the 200-m isobath and with higher chlorophyll-a concentration as proxy for their prey density. Combining habitat models with fisheries activity records indicated that the areas where these overlaps may represent key mobulid habitats. This study highlights a critical need for species-specific and populations-level management measures for Indonesian mobulid rays, whereas current MPA design has focused on a broad-scale coastal ecosystem management approach, which may have limited effectiveness in practice. This study provides valuable information for the improvement of MPA design and fisheries management tools, through maximum entropy modeling as a powerful means to describe species’ distributions and habitat preference. We recommend that future efforts focus on documenting and incorporating data from large-scale commercial fisheries to improve our knowledge of habitat preference and distribution models in offshore areas and the high seas, and to assess the preference for coastal versus oceanic habitats.}

abstract = {Irrespective of the magnitude and spatial extend, the consequences of a natural hazard are strongly connected to the vulnerability of elements at risk (e.g. people, buildings and infrastructure). It is, therefore, obvious that an analysis and quantification of vulnerability is required for successful disaster risk reduction. The need for vulnerability assessment is crucial due to the effects of climate change as well as the socio-economic dynamics that may directly impact vulnerabilities and coping capacities of affected communities. Vulnerability is multidimensional (physical, social, economic, etc.), however, the dimension which is mainly related to the direct costs and threat to human lives is the physical one. We focus here on the physical vulnerability of buildings subject to torrential hazards occurring in small and steep mountain catchments. These processes include fluvial sediment transport, debris floods, and debris flows. Furthermore, we included flash flood hazards if these are related to torrential catchments. Physical vulnerability to torrential hazards in mountain areas is a topic that has been under scientific investigation over the last 20 years. Several methods to assess physical vulnerability of buildings towards flash floods, debris flows and hyper-concentrated flows can be found in the literature. The plethora of methods and approaches may be classified under the following three categories: vulnerability matrices, vulnerability curves and vulnerability indices. We provide a short review of these methods which became available over the last decade and which dominate the scientific debate in mountain hazard risk management, giving an emphasis to vulnerability curves. The approaches presented herein are highlighted through case studies from the European Alps and beyond. Furthermore, challenges in vulnerability assessment including data requirements, need for improved event documentation, uncertainties and challenges related to future climate and socio-economic changes are outlined. Finally, a discussion on progress-driving factors such as new technologies (e.g. mobile apps, drones), citizen science and new innovative assessment methods is provided.}

Anticipating when and where both biophysical and cultural ES will be affected by these two types of coastal environmental change is critical for sustainable land-use planning and management. Biophysical (provisioning and regulating) services can be mapped using secondary data. We demonstrate an approach to mapping cultural ES by engaging stakeholders in iterative participatory mapping of personally and communally valuable cultural ES. We identify hotspots where highly valued cultural ES and high values for biophysical ES co-occur and generate spatially-explicit projections of sea level rise and urban expansion through 2060 to quantify impacts of the ‘coastal squeeze’ on ES. We study Johns Island, South Carolina, USA as an example of a vulnerable community in a low-lying region experiencing both rising water levels and a rapid influx of new residents and development. Our projections of environmental change through 2060 indicate that on Johns Island, cultural ES face disproportionately greater risk of decline than biophysical ES, with almost three quarters of the island’s cultural ES affected. We find that hotspots for cultural ES, such as community heritage sites and scenic vistas of oak-lined roads and marshes, rarely co-occur (only 3% area) with biophysical ES such as high values of carbon sequestration and agricultural production. This confirms the importance of engaging with local stakeholders to map cultural ES and puts them on a more level playing field with biophysical ES in decision-making contexts. Projected declines and limited overlap between biophysical and cultural ES highlight the need for tighter coordination between conservation and community planning, and for including locally valued cultural ES in assessments of threats posed by the ‘coastal squeeze’ of sea level rise and urban expansion.}

Building upon the increasing narrative of digital social participation that describes crowdsourcing processes as short ways towards democratisation of public decision-making processes, our research describes the trends and threats associated with the “hyperconnected city” imaginary advanced by (part of) scholarly research and EC policy documents and projects. We show how, while these last describe digital-supported participation processes as (at least potentially) able to bootstrap an open governance agenda, local urban initiatives suggest the need to question this technology-optimistic imaginary. A critical analysis of crowdsourcing for public governance prototyped and piloted in some European cities makes it evident that at local level, alternative imaginaries are emerging. We describe them in this paper as the “receptive city” (often adopted by public institutions and administration), and the “do-it-yourself city” (referring to the critical perspective of (digital) social activists) imaginaries, both emerging from local-based experiences and debates; and clarify their convergence and divergence how these differs from the above-mentioned “hyperconnected city” imaginary prefigured by EC guidelines. The conclusive section further expands the analysis prefiguring future research possibilities promises in terms of local experiences influencing the future internet for society and digital agenda for Europe.}

In existing methods, the computation overheads grow rapidly with data volumes, leading to the incapability of providing real-time visualization for large-scale spatial vector data, even with parallel acceleration technologies. To fill the gap, we present HiVision, a display-driven visualization model for large-scale spatial vector data. Different from traditional data-driven methods, the computing units in HiVision are pixels rather than spatial objects to achieve real-time performance, and efficient spatial-index-based strategies are introduced to estimate the topological relationships between pixels and spatial objects. HiVision can maintain exceedingly good performance regardless of the data volume due to the stable pixel number for display. In addition, an optimized parallel computing architecture is proposed in HiVision to ensure the ability of real-time visualization. Experiments show that our approach outperforms traditional methods in rendering speed and visual effects while dealing with large-scale spatial vector data, and can provide interactive visualization of datasets with billion-scale points/segments/edges in real-time with flexible rendering styles. The HiVision code is open-sourced at https://github.com/MemoryMmy/HiVision with an online demonstration.}

The census and the municipal basemaps and orthophotos were overlaid in a Geographic Information System (GIS) to evaluate their similarities and differences, the reasons for inconsistencies between them. Of the 68 districts with subnormal agglomerates (EDSAs; special enumeration districts for slum areas in the Brazilian demographic census), 59% are in the categories ‘high coincidence’ or ‘partial coincidence’ with the perimeters of favelas (the main type of slum in Brazil) delineated by the Sao Paulo municipal government; the names of the residential area (favela/EDSA) are the same in only 51.5% of the subnormal agglomerates, while 26.5% of the EDSAs include residential areas not considered favelas by the municipality. Many Brazilian researchers state that the underestimation of EDSA census data is accentuated by the exclusion of favelas smaller than 51 dwellings from the census. However, at least in Sao Mateus, the exclusion of small favelas (3.6%) was not the only reason for census underestimation of favelas.}

To improve soil erosion sampling survey methods and accurately and rapidly estimate the actual rates of soil erosion, a Pan-Third Pole region was taken as an example to study a methodology of soil erosion sampling survey based on high-spatial-resolution remote sensing images. The sampling units were designed using a stratified variable probability systematic sampling method. The spatiotemporal characteristics of soil erosion and conservation were taken into account, and finer-resolution freely available and accessible images in Google Earth were used. Through the visual interpretation of the free high-resolution remote sensing images, detailed information on land use and soil conservation measures was obtained. Then, combined with the regional soil erosion factor data products, such as rainfall-runoff erosivity factor (R), soil erodibility factor (K), and slope length and steepness factor (LS), the soil loss rates of some sampling units were calculated. The results show that, based on these high-resolution remote sensing images, the land use and soil conservation measures of the sampling units can be quickly and accurately extracted. The interpretation accuracy in 4 typical cross sections was more than 80%, and sampling accuracy, described by histogram similarity in 11 large sampling sites, show that the landuse of sampling uints can represent the structural characteristics of regional land use. Based on the interpretation of data from the sample survey and the regional soil erosion factor data products, the calculation of the soil erosion rate can be completed quickly. The calculation results can reflect the actual conditions of soil erosion better than the potential soil erosion rates calculated by using the coarse-resolution remote sensing method.}

Usually, detailed ground information about phenological phases is only available as point observations. However, in most application scenarios of spatially interpolated phenological information is required. In this article, we present an approach for modeling and interpolation of crop phenological phases in temperate climates on the example of the total area of Germany using statistical analysis and a Kriging prediction process. The presented model consists of two major parts. First, daily temperature observations are spatially interpolated to retrieve a countrywide temperature data set. Second, this temperature information is linked to the day of year on which a phenological event was observed by a governmental observation network. The accumulated temperature sum between sowing and observed phenological events is calculated. The day on which the temperature sum on any location exceeds a phase-specific critical temperature sum, which indicates the day of entry of the modeled phase, is finally interpolated to retrieve a countrywide data set of a specific phenological phase. The model was applied on the example of eight agricultural species including cereals, maize and root crops and 37 corresponding phases in 2011. The results for most of the tested crops and phases show significantly lower root mean squared errors (RMSE) values and higher goodness of fit (R2) values compared to results computed using Ordinary Kriging (OK) and Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW). The modeling accuracy varies between 2.14days and 11.45days for heading and emergence of winter wheat, respectively. The uncertainty of the majority of the modeled phases is less than a week. The model is universally applicable due to automatic parametrization, but model accuracies depend on the crop type and increase during a growing season. The possibility to enhance the model by additional explaining variables is demonstrated by consideration of soil moisture within an extended model setting.}

Combining biosensing with other techniques allows insights to be generated not only about the intensity of somatic response but also, crucially, the underlying causes of that response. Despite pioneering work in this area, a rigorous, empirically-led analysis of biosensing measures in mixed methods research has hitherto been lacking. We address this lacuna through a case study of urban walking, comparing a field-based study (30 participants) with a virtual exercise undertaken in a lab (25 participants). Combining biosensing with data on environmental stimuli (recorded using video/GPS) and interviews, three analytical modes are examined: biosensing-led; environment-led; and thematic-led. The analysis shows how each dataset can add contextualizing information to significant phenomena observed in the others. We demonstrate, however, that biosensing measures become considerably more difficult to interpret beyond the controlled environment of the lab. The paper concludes that biosensing should be seen as a valuable measure in field studies, but one which requires careful interpretation through other datasets, being of limited usefulness and reliability taken alone.}

abstract = {In the information era, cities are connected by data networks and, therefore, solutions to urban problems have been supported by Information and Communication Technologies, which provide the interaction between government and citizens. Thus, information plays a crucial role in Smart Cities, enabling the smart governance, under the precepts of good governance, highlighting the participation and transparency. In addition, Geoinformation turns the Multipurpose Territorial Cadastre into a decision support informational source that is of great relevance in the context of Smart Governance. Based on this context, the present study investigates the geotechnology scenario applied by the governments of the Brazilian capitals, observing the availability of Multipurpose Territorial Cadastre on the Internet and considering the Geoinformation, Transparency and Collaborative participation aspects. In this sense, this paper proposes an exploratory research, with quantitative and qualitative analyzes. In the first stage, it was identified the cities that offer access to territorial information via the Internet, i.e., quantifying cities with active geoportals. Next, the second step qualifies the geoportals of cities according to their existence and access to certain information. The types of information selected for the survey, considered the evolution of the Cadastre, observing three aspects: (i) cadastral information; (ii) thematic information; and (iii) collaborative interface. The results showed that just over half of the capitals keep active geoportals and almost 1/3 of the capitals make available on the Internet a Multipurpose Territorial Cadastre. In terms of Transparency, it was noted that open access data is still lower than non-available or restricted access data. Moreover, the aspect of Collaborative participation is meaningless. Analyzing the results, it can be noted the need to improve both the availability of data and open access to information regarding the aspects of Multipurpose Territorial Cadastre in the geoportals, mainly the cadastral information. These actions could promote the transparency and collaborative participation that, consequently, will improve the effectiveness of smart governance in the Brazilian capitals.}

abstract = {Group recommendation has attracted researchers’ attention in various domains, specifically such approaches utilizing location-based social networks (LBSNs). However, point of interest (POI) group recommendation faces the challenge of aggregating diverse user preferences, while group members have different influences on the final decision of the group. Besides, the recommendation of spatial items is different from non-spatial items and the unique features of the spatial items such as distance must be considered in the recommendation. In this paper, a POI group recommendation method is proposed to tackle this problem. User influence is modeled fuzzy and taken into account the difference of users’ personality and their preferences when are alone or in a group, by using historical check-in data in LBSNs and in terms of category, distance and time. The proposed method is integrated with the weighted average aggregation to improve the efficiency of the POI group recommendation. Experimental results in a real dataset show improvement in the accuracy of POI group recommendations in varying sizes of groups. The results also get better when the user influence is calculated using the fuzzy approach. Besides, studying user behavior differences to choose the place to visit when alone or in a group shows that i) the flexibility of users in distance is less than time and category. It is also in the category less than time. ii) Time has a greater range of behavioral change than distance and category. iii) Users who actively participate in group decision making have a more significant number of visits in groups than when they are alone.}

Our analysis shows support for the use of geotagged social media to supplement data collected through traditional means (e.g., on-site counts of visitors) as part of visitor use monitoring protocols. However, we did observe notable differences in the amount of variance in reported visitation explained by geotagged social media. Social media posts made within national parks and national forests captured substantially more of the variation in reported visitation relative to posts made within state parks. We attribute this to a variety of factors including the unique types of sites managed within the state park system, lower levels of visitation relative to national parks and forests within the state, and the method by which the state estimates visitation. We use exploratory spatial analyses to investigate spatial patterns of visitation across public lands. The analysis, performed at three different spatial scales (statewide, region, and county) illustrate the diversity of ways in which geotagged social media can inform outdoor recreation and tourism planning efforts and supplement traditional methods of measuring visitation. Our investigation demonstrates how social media can serve as a useful tool to inform proactive planning and management efforts.}

The use of these two separate efforts needs to be harmonized so that geospatial information does not remain an isolated area on the Web. Motivated by several domain use cases, we synthesize a list of provenance questions and analyze gaps between the two models in addressing these questions. Our strategy is to enrich W3C PROV with domain semantics from the ISO 19115 lineage model by suggesting ways to bridge them. A semantic mapping between the ISO lineage model and the W3C PROV model is formalized, and key issues involved are discussed. Use cases illustrate the applicability of the approach.}

Heritage reputation can be strategic for urban and regional planners when analyzing and implementing policies. Crowdsourcing geographic knowledge, web 2.0 and social media play a significant role in today's society because this new source of information can help modeling the evolving human landscape, complementing the existing methods. Indeed, location-based user-generated content can be a relevant source for heritage studies and citizen sensing can be used to model and measure heritage reputation.}

abstract = {The development of 3D property registration systems is indispensable for the spatial determination of property Rights, Restrictions and Responsibilities (RRR), the sustainable operation of property markets and the safeguarding of ownership in the highly urbanized world. Several developments in computer graphics, 3D modelling and rendering techniques have attracted the growing global interest in 3D cadastre. Since 2012, the Land Administration Domain Model (LADM ISO 19152) is adopted as the international standard for 2D and 3D cadastral data modelling. Developed legal procedures and prototype systems for 3D property rights registration provide interesting solutions for data acquisition and visualization but such approaches are time and cost demanding. In parallel, 2D cadastral surveying procedures have progressed significantly in reducing required time and cost, utilizing crowdsourcing methodology and mobile services. This paper presents a technical solution under development, aiming to provide the beginning for a new era in the initial acquisition, registration and representation of 3D crowdsourced cadastral data, appropriate for both the developed and the developing world. The proposed solution consists of two complementary parts, the technical framework and the crowdsourced methodology to be followed. The technical framework consists of two interconnected parts, the server-side and the client-side. The server-side refers to the Database Management System (DBMS) where the collected data are stored. The client-side refers to the data capturing tool, which in this case is the mobile device. For the server-side, a prototype system based on model driven architecture practices and LADM is developed; while for the client-side, an open-source mobile application for the acquisition of 3D crowdsourced cadastral data, 3D modelling and visualization of 3D property units as block models (LoD1) on a mobile’s phone screen in real-time, is developed. This research is focused on investigating technical aspects for capturing and integrating data about legal rights on physical objects. Detailed investigation of legal issues is not within the objectives of this research. Two case-studies for testing the proposed technical solution are made. An assessment of the current stage of development of the technical solution is presented. The main conclusions converge that the proposed technical solution has huge potentials for the fast, economic implementation of 3D cadastral surveys as it can produce an accurate and reliable 3D information model, depending on the accuracy of the available basemaps. The developed application is easy-to-use as users may not have the necessary level of 3D modelling skills in order to contribute to the registration procedure.}

The results showed that hot grids are primarily clustered along the main street through the downtown area during working days, whereas cold grids are often observed at the edge of the city during the weekend. The mixed use (of commercial and life services, restaurants and snack bars, offices, leisure areas and sports complexes) is the most significant contributing factor. A new cold grid emerged near conference venues before the Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa Summit, revealing the strong effects of regulations on population dynamics and its evolving patterns. This study demonstrates that the proposed data-driven framework might offer new insights into urban population dynamics and its driving mechanism in support of sustainable urban development.}

Crowdsourcing is a novel approach to gathering information, encouraging innovation and facilitating group decision-making. Unfortunately, although previous research has explored the utility of crowdsourcing applied to urban planning theoretically, there are still rare real practices or empirical studies using practical data. This study aims to identify the prospects for implementing crowdsourcing in urban planning through a bibliometric analysis on current research. First, database and keyword lists based on peer-reviewed journal articles were developed. Second, semantic analysis is applied to quantify co-occurrence frequencies of various terms in the articles based on the keyword lists, and in turn a semantic network is built. Then, cluster analysis was conducted to identify major and correlated research topics, and bursting key terms were analyzed and explained chronologically. Lastly, future research and practical trends were discussed. The major contribution of this study is identifying crowdsourcing as a novel urban planning method, which can strengthen government capacities by involving public participation, i.e., turning governments into task givers. Regarding future patterns, the application of crowdsourcing in urban planning is expected to expand to transportation, public health and environmental issues. It is also indicated that the use of crowdsourcing requires governments to adjust urban planning mechanisms.}

In the context of course-based mapping activities directed to neighbourhood Sector-level planning officers and action research, this study has employed a two-tier approach (planning officials doing the mapping and eliciting complementary information from the population) to online participatory mapping (Google My Maps) for urban planning purposes in the barrios of Caracas. Our efforts aimed mostly at identifying and mapping public facilities, and planned and under-construction public works. This research aims to show the potential contribution of such tools to planning informal settlements and creating locally-produced spatial information. The outcomes of the mapping courses have already proven to be useful for planning public projects across Sectors and Communes, mutual consideration of their priorities in the preparation of two-year development plans, and for increased awareness of local residents of communal councils.}

The social vulnerability index (SoVI) has equipped extensive efforts to assess social vulnerability over the past two decades. However, only a few studies have paid attention to the intra-city level social vulnerability, and knowledge gaps still exist in understanding the spatial patterns of urban social vulnerability. This paper presents a hierarchical pattern of urban social vulnerability by a SoVI assessment of the 5432 neighborhoods (residential committee, or juwei in Chinese) in Shanghai metropolitan, China. High SoVI occupies the city center; to its outside is a low SoVI belt, which is surrounded by medium–high SoVI in the vast suburbs and low SoVI appears in the local centers of the suburbs. This hierarchical pattern is highly significant for enhancing the understanding of urban social vulnerability. It can also facilitate urban risk management and enhance urban sustainability by identifying socially vulnerable communities and the vulnerable combination of social vulnerability and natural hazards. In this paper, an integration of the SoVI result and a flood scenario reveals vulnerable areas that should be high priorities on the agendas for mitigating flood hazards and social vulnerability.}

PPGIS/PGIS are spatially explicit methods that have evolved over the past decade to identify a range of ecosystem services. Although PPGIS/PGIS methods demonstrate high potential for the identification of ecosystem services, especially cultural services, there has been no review to evaluate the methods to identify best practice. Through examination of peer-reviewed, empirical PPGIS/PGIS studies, we describe the types of ecosystem services mapped, the spatial mapping methods, the sampling approaches and range of participants, the types of spatial analyses performed, and the methodological trade-offs associated with each PPGIS/PGIS mapping approach. We found that multiple methods were implemented in nearly 30 case studies worldwide with the mapping of cultural and provisioning services being most common. There was little evidence that mapped ecosystem data was used for actual decision support in land use planning. Best practice has yet to coalesce in this field that has been dominated by methodological pluralism and case study research. We suggest greater use of experimental design and long-term case studies where the influence of mapped ecosystem services on land use decisions can be assessed.}

The frequency of recent incidents including natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, and hurricanes, and also difficulties caused by the economic downturn has highlighted the vulnerability of human settlements and makes the appropriate consideration of resilience in the planning for future of urban areas of vital significance. Development of an assessment framework for evaluating the extent of resiliency of urban areas can be an effective way of incorporating resiliency-related issues into the urban planning process. For this purpose, it is necessary to clarify the implications of the resilience concept for the sustainability of urban areas. It is also important to identify resilience-related principles and criteria that should be embedded in the framework for assessing the resiliency of urban environments. This study involves an initial review of the literature on resilience and urban sustainability to extract a comprehensive set of criteria that can be used to develop an urban resilience assessment system. Moreover, it tries to design a conceptual framework, illustrative of the inter-relations between these various set of criteria. Criteria for assessment of the resilience of urban areas are divided into several main themes that cover environmental, economic, social, and institutional dimensions of sustainability. These themes would further be broken down into major criteria to account for important relevant areas such as land use, infrastructure, health, etc. The output of this study can be used as the basis for defining a set of precise indicators that will constitute a potential assessment tool for measuring the resilience of urban developments. The resilient assessment process has the capacity to provide decision makers with a clear and comprehensive picture of the resilience of the development proposal and supports them in making better informed decisions.}

abstract = {3D city models are valuable and useful for many experts using this information for a wide array of environmental and sustainable analyses and services. To produce 3D city models, conventional production processes are typically conducted by authoritative mapping agencies, which mostly rely on aerial photogrammetry and laser scanning. Consequently, obtaining public domain 3D city models is challenging and limited, where the majority of open data is collected and mapped by participatory mapping driven communities. These are still limited to 2D data collection proficiencies due to the used mapping infrastructures and technological limitations. Thus, the 3rd (height) dimension is mostly missing from these maps and models, resulting in the fact that public domain 3D city models are still limited, and only scarcely used for environmental applications. Perhaps one of the most important features in 3D city models are the buildings, since they serve as a major geospatial element in many environmental applications. Our objective is to use a single contributed photograph and OpenStreetMap vector data to precisely calculate the photographed building height, and add this data to the OpenStreetMap map to enable the creation of open source Level of Detail 1 (LoD1) city models. To this end, we have developed a Newton's-based method in optimization to accurately calculate building heights from single contributed photographs taken by citizens using smartphones or tablets. An Android app, OpenStreetHeight, is developed to carry out the experiments. Based on the various medium-height buildings that were photographed using the app and processed using the developed algorithms we received accurate building height values. When compared to reliable reference field measurements, the average height mean absolute error was 30cm. Combined with the OpenStreetMap footprint vector data, we were able to produce an average LoD1 volume mean absolute error of less than 5%, satisfying the CityGML standard quality. This research presents a framework for a semi-automatic crowdsourced user-generated content calculation of OpenStreetMap building heights, and the creation of reliable and accurate LoD1 building models, as a first step to enhance the already established 2D OpenStreetMap map infrastructure to the 3D domain. This enables expanding the use of OpenStreetMap as a comprehensive and detailed representation of our urban environment for various environmental and sustainable applications and analyses.}

abstract = {Industrialization and urbanization have led to a remarkable increase of electric power consumption (EPC) during the past decades. To assess the changing patterns of EPC at the global scale, this study utilized nighttime lights in conjunction with population and built-up datasets to map EPC at 1 km resolution. Firstly, the inter-calibrated nighttime light data were enhanced using the V4.0 Gridded Population Density data and the Global Human Settlement Layer. Secondly, linear models were calibrated to relate EPC to the enhanced nighttime light data; these models were then employed to estimate per-pixel EPC in 2000 and 2013. Finally, the spatiotemporal patterns of EPC between the periods were analyzed at the country, continental, and global scales. The evaluation of the EPC estimation shows a reasonable accuracy at the provincial scale with R2 of 0.8429. Over 30% of the human settlements in Asia, Europe, and North America showed apparent EPC growth. At the national scale, moderate and high EPC growth was observed in 45% of the built-up areas in East Asia. The spatial clustering patterns revealed that EPC decreased in Russia and the Western Europe. This study provides fresh insight into the spatial pattern and variations of global electric power consumption.}

With growth in geographic information systems (GIS) in the 1990s, research began to operationalize place concepts using GIS to better inform land use decisions. After two decades, participatory mapping has emerged as an important method to identify place values. This article summarizes lessons from empirical research completed in diverse social and geographic contexts. Specifically, we find that mapped place values: (1) are best understood as relationship values, (2) reflect participant spatial/geographic discounting, (3) are closely related to place attachment and “sense of place” concepts, (4) are correlated with participant attitudes and preferences toward land use, (5) are predictive of land use conflict, (6) are associated with physical landscape features, (7) are generally stable over time, (8) are valid at multiple geographic scales, (9) exhibit greater similarity than differences across geographic areas and populations, and (10) show little evidence of actually influencing land use decisions. Despite research validity and the potential to improve social acceptability of land use decisions, place values will have limited social impact without elevating the importance of broader public participation in current socio-political systems.}

Cities located within Tornado Alley are especially at risk of being affected by tornadic activity and thus have a pressing need for a warning system. The use of strategically-placed outdoor tornado sirens is a common approach to notify residents of approaching severe weather. However, it remains difficult to ensure complete coverage (i.e. every resident within an audible distance of a siren) of such a system within a city. This study uses two distinct GIS-based methodological approaches using U.S. Census population data and siren locations to assess the extent city residents are safeguarded by the existing tornado siren network in Stillwater, Oklahoma. The first approach utilizes spatially unaltered (aggregated) census data whereas the second approach proposes a disaggregation technique incorporating building polygons to improve the spatial detail. The first approach revealed that 26% of city residents are not covered by the siren network, whereas the second approach estimated that 4–14% are not covered. The second approach provided a more precise account of Stillwater's vulnerable population due to its spatially explicit nature.}

abstract = {Abandoned houses (AH) are focal points in urban communities by threatening local security, destroying housing markets, and burdening government finance in the U.S. legacy cities. In particular, individual-level AH detection provides essential information for fine-resolution urban studies, government decision-makers, and private sector practitioners. However, three primary conventional data sources (field data, utility data, and remote sensing data) cannot suffice to collect such fine-resolution data in the large spatial area via a cost-effective approach. To this end, Google Street View (GSV) imagery, which emerges as the mainstream open-access data source with global coverage, provides an opportunity to address this issue. Subsequently, a follow-up challenge confronting the detection of AH arises from the fact that it lacks an effective method that can discern authentic visual features from the redundant noise in GSV images. In this study, we aim to develop an effective method to detect individual-level AH from GSV imagery. Specifically, we developed a new hierarchical deep learning method to leverage both global and local visual features of AH in the detection. The method can be further divided into three steps: (1) Scene-based classification that can extract global visual features of AH was implemented through fine-tuning a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model. (2) We developed a patch-based classification method that can extract specific local features of AH. In this method, patches were generated from GSV images based on auto-detected local features, followed by being labeled as three categories: building patches, vegetation patches, and others. Two deep CNN models were employed to identify deteriorated building façade patches and overgrown vegetation patches, respectively. (3) Individual-level AH were detected by integrating scene classification results and patch classification results in a decision-tree model. Experimental results showed that the F-score of AH was 0.84 in a well-prepared dataset collected from five different Rust Belt cities. The proposed hierarchical deep learning approach effectively improved the accuracy comparing with the traditional scene-based method. In addition, the proposed method was applied to generate an AH map in a new site in Detroit, MI. Our study demonstrated the feasibility of GSV imagery in AH detection and showed great potential to detect AH in a large spatial extent.}

Medical records from a Hospital in Bondowoso Regency were the data source of the snakebite cases. Three spatial statistical summaries were applied to analyze the spatial pattern of snakebite incidents. The comparison between statistical functions and the theoretical model of random distributions shows a significant clustering pattern of the events. The pattern indicates that five subdistricts in Bondowoso have a substantial number of snakebite cases more than other regions. This finding shows the potential application of spatial statistics for the snakebite combating strategy in this area by identifying the priority locations of the snakebite cases.}

This is achieved by performing the task of route computation in a distributed manner. Specifically, the client decomposes the required route into a sequence of shorter routes between intermediate locations. These routes are subsequently requested from independent online route planners with the results being integrated by the client to give the route originally required. Robustness to privacy inferences is a consequence of the fact that, without significant coordination and sharing of information, an individual online route planner cannot infer with high probability the true route source or destination. An evaluation of the proposed method is performed in the context of route planning within the street network of Boston. This evaluation demonstrates that the proposed method offers robustness to privacy inferences while exhibiting a reasonable reduction in quality of service.}

abstract = {Public participation geographic information systems (PPGIS), though proven valuable in ecosystem services (ES) research, is occasionally criticized for being expensive in terms of time, cost and administration efforts in case the post-hoc sophisticated spatial analytics/statistics are targeted. This study, based on the enhancement of the pre-developed PPGIS analytical framework, seeks to address these critiques by introducing an in-expensive effective data collection strategy, while substantially facilitating geo-spatial analytics. The U Minh Thuong National Park (UMTNP) in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam, a world’s renowned Ramsar site, was chosen to demonstrate the framework. The respondents participated in the participatory mapping on paper maps, using color markers to hand-draw (as polygons) their self-perceived areas associated with different categories ES. By collecting 2D data, the post-hoc spatial analyses could have utilized more meaningful statistical methods. In this study, we introduced the uses of three methods: Ordinary least squares (OLS), Geographically weighted regression (GWR) and Moran’s I to assess the spatial autocorrelation of ES across the landscape. In addition to participatory mapping, the respondents were also engaged in completing a semi-structured questionnaire, which was subsequently analyzed using principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis. These two multivariate analyses serve to reveal the structured diversity of the people’s perceptions towards the importance of different ES. It was shown that Provisioning ES was the most highly regarded benefit, followed by Regulating, Supporting and Cultural. Regulating and Supporting ES, the two indirect material services share relatively similar appreciation patterns while Cultural ES was unexpectedly the least credited, a stark contrast lineagainst the government designated eco-tourism and historical functions of UMTNP. Geographically, the core areas of the national park have the most overlaps between Provisioning and Regulating services. Supporting services, on the other hand, were the most associated with Provisioning and Regulating services in peripheral areas. Cultural services were synergized with the other three types of ES in the areas reserved for eco-tourism activities. The revealed spatial synergies can determine the areas where potential conflicts between extractive and non-extractive uses could occur, contributing insights for sustainable management of UMTNP and other protected areas worldwide. In addition, this study also contributes to promoting the PPGIS method in ES research and other human geographical studies, those relying on community participation.}

In this paper, we demonstrate how a recently developed inequality measure—the Kolm-Pollak equally-distributed equivalent (EDE)—could be used to support decision making to foster equity in the built environment. The EDE provides a measure of a distribution that is similar to the average (mean) but includes a penalty based on the inequality of that distribution. The primary advantage of the Kolm-Pollak EDE is that it can be used to evaluate the inequality of both desirable quantities (e.g., amenities) and undesirable quantities (e.g., burdens). This is essential in urban systems as inequities can manifest through, among other things, disparate access to opportunities like public amenities and unequal exposure to burdens, such as pollution and natural hazards. Additionally, the Kolm-Pollak EDE can be calculated for different sociodemographic subgroups, enabling needs-based assessments to promote environmental justice. Thus, the Kolm-Pollak EDE presents numerous opportunities for practitioners, policymakers, and researchers concerned with advancing equity. We demonstrate the approach with a case study of grocery store access in ten cities across the USA and provide a Python package (inequalipy) and R code to enable others to use these inequality metrics.}

Previous studies applied spatial data to evaluate environmental deprivation across various neighborhoods, and the identified deprived areas can be directly used in urban planning as areas that need to be addressed. However, perceptions of oneself regarding the local urban environment can influence sense of wellbeing, mental health, and social behavior of this individual; and any adverse feelings from the subjective environmental status can further influence perceived environmental deprivation. This perceived environmental deprivation can be different from the estimation of “objective” environmental deprivation, and perception itself can vary among subpopulations. Absence of consideration of variation in perceived environmental deprivation can lead to a failure of sustainable planning to support all oppressed people affected by urban development. Therefore, we combined citizens’ perceptions with remote-sensed and administrative data to characterize perceived environmental deprivation among subpopulations, based on a questionnaire with ranks of specific environmental issues under a “city as a whole” concept. Generally, perceived environmental deprivation among subpopulations was driven by different facts. Based on the spatial comparison, self-identified urban residents and people aged>=30 have faced higher environmental deprivation across the whole city than self-identified rural residents and younger ages. Females, lower income population, and indoor workers have faced with higher environmental deprivation across urban areas than males and higher income population and outdoor workers. These implied that perceived environmental deprivation may be driven by social behaviors of individuals because of social inequality, while planning protocols should be targeted to specific populations to provide comprehensive community support and equity.}

The advent of the geospatial big data revolution has created additional opportunities to map population distributions at fine resolutions with high accuracy. A considerable proportion of the geospatial data contains semantic information that indicates different categories of human activities occurring at exact geographic locations. Such information is often lacking in remote sensing data. In addition, the remarkable progress in machine learning provides toolkits for demographers to model complex nonlinear correlations between population and heterogeneous geographic covariates. In this study, a typical type of geospatial big data, points-of-interest (POIs), was combined with multi-source remote sensing data in a random forests model to disaggregate the 2010 county-level census population data to 100 × 100 m grids. Compared with the WorldPop population dataset, our population map showed higher accuracy. The root mean square error for population estimates in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chongqing for this method and WorldPop were 27,829 and 34,193, respectively. The large under-allocation of the population in urban areas and over-allocation in rural areas in the WorldPop dataset was greatly reduced in this new population map. Apart from revealing the effectiveness of POIs in improving population mapping, this study promises the potential of geospatial big data for mapping other socioeconomic parameters in the future.}

Presumably, the willingness-to-pay for landscape amenities should be very different between homeowners and tenants. Thus far, how landscape amenities affect residential rental prices is not well understood. This paper takes advantage of the big data of online housing advertisements to unravel how landscape amenities are capitalized into rental prices across five Chinese megacities (Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Hangzhou and Wuhan). Natural language processing, the latent Dirichlet allocation in particular, is first employed to semantically analyze the geo-textual advertisements. It reveals that ‘landscape amenities’ is a typical topic and ‘park’ is a typical component for housing advertisements in the five megacities. The lexicon-based sentimental analysis further shows that the strength of the sentiments associated with the ‘landscape amenities’ varies with cities. A series of hierarchical hedonic models based on the extracted semantic and sentimental aspects are then established for each megacity after segmenting the rental market into submarkets. The capitalization effect of landscape amenities is significant in Beijing, Hangzhou and Wuhan, while it is not significant in Shanghai and Shenzhen. Finally, variance decomposition analysis and marginal implicit price calculation unveil to what extent landscape amenities contribute to residential rental prices. Based on these findings, we discuss several major implications for urban planning. Our study unsettles the popular presumption that landscape amenities are key determinants of real estate values. It renews our understanding of the economic values of landscape amenities theoretically and methodologically.}

With emerging big data and cloud-based services, there are new opportunities for data collection, influencing both official data collection processes and the operation of the programmes they monitor. This paper uses cases and examples to explore the potential of crowdsourcing and public earth observation (EO) data products for monitoring and tracking the SDGs. This paper suggests that cloud-based services that integrate crowdsourcing and public EO data products provide cost-effective solutions for monitoring and tracking the SDGs, particularly for low-income countries. The paper also discusses the challenges of using cloud services and big data for SDG monitoring. Validation and quality control of public EO data is very important; otherwise, the user will be unable to assess the quality of the data or use it with confidence.}

This paper investigates Twitter activity in the wake of Hurricane Sandy in order to demonstrate the complex relationship between the material world and its digital representations. Through documenting the various spatial patterns of Sandy-related tweeting both within the New York metropolitan region and across the United States, we make a series of broader conceptual and methodological interventions into the nascent geographic literature on big data. Rather than focus on how these massive databases are causing necessary and irreversible shifts in the ways that knowledge is produced, we instead find it more productive to ask how small subsets of big data, especially georeferenced social media information scraped from the internet, can reveal the geographies of a range of social processes and practices. Utilizing both qualitative and quantitative methods, we can uncover broad spatial patterns within this data, as well as understand how this data reflects the lived experiences of the people creating it. We also seek to fill a conceptual lacuna in studies of user-generated geographic information, which have often avoided any explicit theorizing of sociospatial relations, by employing Jessop et al.’s TPSN framework. Through these interventions, we demonstrate that any analysis of user-generated geographic information must take into account the existence of more complex spatialities than the relatively simple spatial ontology implied by latitude and longitude coordinates.}

Over two decades have transpired since the term was introduced and this chapter revisits the emergence of both theory and practice over that time. The chapter begins with a reintroduction of some of the key elements of Cybercartography in two previous volumes (Taylor, 2005; Taylor and Lauriault, 2014) and goes on to discuss new theoretical and applied dimensions leading to a re-definition of the concept. The central elements as outlined in the earlier volumes are still relevant today but have been modified, expanded and refined as a result of the ongoing research, especially that resulting from the application of Cybercartography in an international/Indigenous context and the application of Cartography to language mapping, both of which have led to new theoretical insights. The initial definition of Cybercartography was strongly influenced by practice rather than theory. The central importance of the main product of Cybercartography, the cybercartographic atlas, remains, but recent thinking and experience sees the importance of the process by which such atlases are produced as equally, if not more important, than the product. Over time, storytelling has become increasingly important to Cybercartography. Both mapping and storytelling are basic human instincts and are a central part of the holistic nature of Cybercartography.}

What can be considered a geographic information system has expanded to include web-based technologies like Google Earth/Maps, as well as more recent developments of Microsoft’s Bing Maps and the mobile version of ArcGIS available for the iPhone. In addition to these developments, a discursive shift toward ‘location’ is occurring across the Internet industry. Location has become the new buzzword for social-spatial strategies to target consumers. As reported in 2010, venture capitalists have, since 2009, invested $115million into ‘location start-ups’ – software companies that provide location-based services to mobile computing consumers (Miller and Wortham, 2010). Applications like Foursquare, Loopt, Gowalla, and most recently, Facebook Places allow users to ‘check-in’ at restaurants, bars, gyms, retail outlets, and offices, thereby sharing their location within their social network. These developments enable consumers to (re)discover their proximities to products, while feeding a desire for making known one’s everyday movements. Here, I discuss the development of location-based services as the proliferation of a peculiar form of geographic information: conspicuous mobility. Through discussion of a recent gathering of location-aware software professionals and through analysis of discourses that emerge over a battle between ‘check in’ companies, I sketch an area of study that explores the implications of these emerging geographic information ‘systems’, and new everyday cartographers.}

We used data sets including house structural attributes, house photos, locational amenities, street view images, transportation accessibility, visitor patterns, and socioeconomic attributes of neighborhoods to enrich our understanding of the real estate appreciation and its predictive modeling. As a case study, we investigate more than 20,000 houses in the Greater Boston Area, and discuss the spatial dependency of house price appreciations, influential variables and their relationships. In detail, we extract deep features from street view images and house photos using a deep learning model, merging features from multi-source data and modeling house price appreciation using machine learning models and the geographically weighted regression at two spatial scales: fine-scale point level and aggregated neighborhood level. Results show that the house price appreciation rate can be modeled with high accuracy using the proposed framework (R2=0.74 for gradient boosting machine at neighborhood-scale). We discovered that houses with low house prices and small house areas may have a higher house appreciation potential. Our results provide insights into how multi-source big geo-data can be employed in machine learning frameworks to characterize real estate price trends and help understand human settlements for policy-making.}

Although population distribution has been considered highly correlated with urban facilities, the quantitative relationship between the two has yet to be revealed when considering huge heterogeneity. To address this problem, the present study proposed a novel population mapping method by adopting Luojia 1-01 nighttime light imagery, points of interest (POI), and social media check-in data. A grid-based attraction degree (AD) model was built to quantify the possibility of population concentration in each geographic unit with a comprehensive consideration of the distribution and the popularity of facilities. On the basis of kernel density estimation, 16 attraction indexes were extracted by matching POI and check-in data. Multiple variables were used to train a random forest model, through which fine-scale population mapping was conducted in Zhejiang, China. The comparison between demographic and WorldPop data proved the high accuracy of our approach (R2 = 0.75 and 0.58). To explore the characteristics of the model further, the most appropriate search distance (650 m) and acquisition time (19:00–08:00) of the check-in data were discussed. The contrast experiment revealed that the model could outperform those from previous studies on rural and suburban areas with a few check-in points and low AD; thus, the mapping error caused by heterogeneity considerably decreased. The results indicated the proposed method has great potential in fine-scale population mapping.}

In this regard, it is paramount to design emergency shelters or open spaces in a forward-looking and dynamic manner, especially when the country faces challenges due to extreme events (e.g. earthquake and floods) and large populations. The aim of this paper is to analyze the issues of this field in China while summarizing instructions for future construction based on the experience and expertise of other countries. Specific suggestions include: (1) combining the designs and plans of emergency shelters/open spaces into the construction of a resilient urban system; (2) embedding routine preparedness into disaster risk reduction approaches; (3) optimizing issues in site-selection using spatiotemporal patterns in refuge demand while designing the shelter system into a hierarchical structure; (4) shifting from a top-down approach to a bottom-up approach, which includes the participation of multiple aspects of shelter construction; and (5) designing and establishing emergency shelters/open spaces to fight against different types of disasters.}

abstract = {Despite the rapidly increasing population of the world, the amount of agricultural land remains the same. For this reason, agricultural fields are gradually becoming ‘collective scarce resources’. Many countries have put restrictions on property ownership in order to manage these resources. In addition, most countries are trying to implement agricultural policies by developing various systems pertaining to these areas. The existing cadastral system in Turkey is inadequately equipped to identify the location, amount and quality of agricultural land. Therefore, due to the nature of agricultural land, the restrictions on immovable property cannot be expediently applied. This study aimed to implement registration of agricultural lands under a Land Administration System (LAS). Thus, public restrictions applied to agricultural areas could be represented under the LAS. In this way, implementation of agricultural policies would be utilised even more effectively than under current land management systems. In order to realise this aim, a village in north-eastern Turkey where cadastral work had not been completed was chosen for the study. Firstly, the agricultural classifications of the subparcels in the village were determined. These were then combined into cadastral parcels. Four important findings emerging from the study showed that: 1) agricultural classification and cadastral work could be carried out together, 2) agricultural areas could be registered in the LAS, 3) public restrictions arising from agricultural land usage could be determined, and 4) the ‘land type’ section in the land registry was insufficient in reflecting the features of the immovable property, thus making a more precise class identity necessary. In addition to ‘land type’, the term ‘land class’ was proposed for the land registry. Although the study was conducted for an unplanned rural area, it is recommended that researchers carry out future studies in terms of more precise identity requirements for urban areas.}

Significant reduction of urban energy consumption and CO2 emissions is essential for meeting the ambitious climate stabilization targets. This hinges on having adequate understanding of the patterns and trends of emissions. It is essential to create datasets of cities emissions and utilize mapping techniques to inform planners and decision makers about the dynamics of urban carbon emissions. Due to the openness of cities and issues related to availability and accessibility of urban energy consumption data, this is a challenging task. It is critical to develop consistent methods for mapping emissions. Such methods and frameworks should enable cities to map their emissions with minimum data requirements. They should also be applicable to different cities across the world. As a preliminary effort, this study introduces a framework for synthesizing building and transport energy consumption data with the Local Climate Zones (LCZs) classification system. Drawing on preliminary results from applying the framework to Bangkok, Shanghai, and Tokyo, we explain how this approach can provide opportunities for standardizing urban carbon accounting. The paper concludes with suggestions for improving granularity and accuracy of emissions accounting. The concept of Local Energy Zones (LEZs) is introduced and is suggested to be used as a potentially suitable concept for analysing CO2 emissions dynamics of cities.}

Meanwhile, road network structure has been analyzed from a network science perspective that focuses on nodes and relational links and aims to predictive models. However, limited empirical studies have explored the relationship between road network structure and ride-sharing accessibility through such perspective. This paper utilizes the spatial Durbin model to understand the relationship between road network structure and ride-sharing accessibility, proxied by Uber accessibility, through classical network measures of degree, closeness, and betweenness centrality. Taking the city of Atlanta as a case study, we have found in addition to population density and road network density, larger values of degree centrality and smaller values of closeness centrality of the road network are associated with better accessibility of Uber services. However, the effects of betweenness centrality are not significant. Furthermore, we have revealed heterogeneous effects of degree centrality and closeness centrality on the accessibility of Uber services, as the magnitudes of their effects vary by different time windows (i.e., weekday vs. weekend, rush hour in the morning vs. evening). Network science provides us both conceptual and methodological measures to understand the association between road network structure and ride-sharing accessibility. In this study, we constructed road network structure measures with OpenStreetMap, which is reproducible, replicable, and scalable because of its global coverage and public availability. The study resonates with the notion of cities as the set of interactions across networks, as we have observed time-sensitive heterogeneous effects of road network structure on ride-sharing accessibility.}

abstract = {Public participation geographic information system (PPGIS) is a global research agenda and practice that aims to broaden the access of GIS technologies to socially marginalized groups in order to facilitate informed participation in decision-making. It prioritizes indigenous or experiential knowledge and advocates its integration with public datasets to contest or reshape policies. PPGIS projects range from rural land use, to conservation and natural resource management, to urban planning, to social and environmental activism, to advocacy. PPGIS work has been shaped by integrated theoretical framework derived from social and political theory, science and technology studies, human–computer interaction, organizational theory, and feminist theory. Participation and spatial knowledge production from PPGIS is situated, highly contingent, and shaped by contextual factors such as political, economic, cultural, and organizational contexts.}
