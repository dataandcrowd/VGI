abstract = {The data presented here were originally collected for the article “Frontiers of Urbanization: Identifying and Explaining Urbanization Hot Spots in the South of Mexico City Using Human and Remote Sensing” (Rodriguez et al. 2017) [4]. They were divided into three databases (remote sensing, human sensing, and census information), using a multi-method approach with the goal of analyzing the impact of urbanization on protected areas in southern Mexico City. The remote sensing database was prepared as a result of a semi-automatic classification, dividing the land cover data into urban and non-urban classes. The second data set details an alternative view of the phenomena of urbanization by concentrating on illegal settlements in the conservation zone. It was based on voluntary complaints about environmental and land use offences filed at the Procuraduria Ambiental y del Ordenamiento Territorial del Distrito Federal (PAOT), which is a governmental entity responsible for reviewing and processing grievances on five basic topics: illegal land use, deterioration of green areas, waste, noise/vibrations, and animals. Anyone can file a PAOT complaint by phone, electronically, or in person. The complaint ends with a resolution, act of conciliation, or recommendation for action by other actors, such as the police or health office. The third data about unemployment was extracted from Mexico׳s National Census 2010 database available via public access.}

We further use the geographic references in a thread-based master plan debate for a university campus to simulate this debate in the map-based forum. This allows us to demonstrate how the online map provides an overview of the status and spatial foci of the debate, and how it can help us understand the spatial thought processes of the participants.}

abstract = {Coral reefs provide important ecological services such as biodiversity, climate regulation, and cultural benefits through recreation and tourism. However, many of the world's reefs are declining, with Caribbean reefs suffering a significant decline in living corals over the past half century. This situation emphasizes the need to assess and monitor reef conditions using a variety of methods. In this study, a new method for assessing reef conditions to inform management using participatory mapping by coral reef “experts” in the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI) is described. Occupational SCUBA divers were recruited (n=87) to map coral reef conditions, uses, and threats (stressors) using an internet-based mapping website. The data reveal an uneven geographic distribution of reef conditions in the USVI with the most frequently mapped perceived healthy reef characteristics being: large amount of physical reef structure (n=872 markers); endangered or threatened species present (n=721); and large amount of live coral cover (n=615). The greatest perceived threats were: invasive species (n=606); water pollution (n=234); and unsustainable fishing (n=200). Areas of important reef characteristics, perceived threats to reefs, and perceived recovery potential were plotted to identify areas requiring critical management attention. The authors found that perceptions of healthy reef conditions outnumbered perceptions of reef threats for nine of the ten most familiar coral reefs; the most frequent activity type within the coral reefs was tourism diving; and for the most familiar coral reefs, the divers perceived a high recovery potential. Given the novelty of participatory mapping methods to assess coral reefs, the strengths and weaknesses of the method is evaluated. The authors further propose a management typology for categorizing reef areas to inform their future management. In the absence of primary data, or, as a supplement to underwater surveys and remotely-sensed data on reef condition, participatory mapping can provide a cost-effective means for assessing coral reef conditions while identifying place-specific reef locations requiring management attention.}

Though traditionally there have always been transactional elements between government and citizen, for example payment of taxes in exchange for services, or voting in exchange for representation, the rise of modern smartphone and smart city technologies have further enabled micro-transactions between citizen, government, and information broker. We conceptualize how the modern smart city, as both envisaged and enacted, incorporates the citizen not necessarily as a whole actor, but as a series of micro-transactions encoded on the real-time landscape of the city. This transactional citizen becomes counted by smart city sensors and integrated into smart city decision-making through the use of certain preferred platforms. To approach this shift from traditional forms of citizen/city interaction towards micro-transactions, we conceptualize four broad modes of transaction; type (intentional contribution), tweet (intermediated by third party), tap (convened or requested transaction), and pass (ambient transaction based on movement). These four modes are used to frame critical questions of how citizens interact with government in the emerging age of the smart city, and how these interactions impact the relationship between citizen and government, introducing new avenues for private sector influence.}

To understand the development and trends in this domain, a bibliometric analysis was performed using 1573 related published articles in Web of Science between 1991 and 2019. We found that (1) the number of annual publications and new research institutes in this field grew rapidly but seems to have become saturated in recent years. (2) The main research force is independent universities with limited cooperation, and a knowledge network has not yet been formed in this arena. (3) Research hotspots evolve in the path of “conceptualization - refinement - application”. Due to the three features of social media data, namely, timeliness, subjectivity, and disequilibrium, obstacles still exist in applicable disaster types and population representativeness. We anticipate new scientific advances emerging to overcome some technical difficulties. Knowledge sharing, advanced computer science, and multiorganizational cooperation will benefit this arena. These findings indicate potential directions for the development of and innovation in social media-based disaster research.}

It measures the degree to which the visual landscape as a whole exceeds the set of its overlapping components (landforms and land cover) regarding diversity. We verified the performance of the index within the National Park Peneda-Gerês (Northern Portugal) as a study area with cumulative viewsheds based on Flickr and Panoramio geolocated content. The results demonstrate a scale-dependent, positive relationship between the proposed index of landscape coherence for the categorical models and the landscape values.

At that time, collecting data for this fishery was done with paper logbooks. This made queries and visualization that could inform management decisions towards our objective impossible in a timely manner. To solve this problem, we built successive software prototypes that leveraged location-aware mobile devices, cloud-based computing, and visualization and query of geographic data over the web.

In this paper, we utilize a prospective Poisson space-time scan statistic to detect daily clusters of COVID-19 at the county level in the contiguous 48 U.S. and Washington D.C. As the pandemic progresses, we generally find an increase of smaller clusters of remarkably steady relative risk. Daily tracking of significant space-time clusters can facilitate decision-making and public health resource allocation by evaluating and visualizing the size, relative risk, and locations that are identified as COVID-19 hotspots.}

Globally, over 5 billion people have access to mobile phones, with an increasing proportion having access to smartphones with capabilities such as a camera, microphone, global positioning system (GPS), data storage, and networked data transfer. Scientists can view these devices as embedded sensors with the potential to take measurements of the Earth's surface and processes. To advance the state of Earth observation using MPCDs, scientists need to consider terms and concepts, from a broad range of disciplines including citizen science, image analysis, and computer vision. In this paper, as a result of our literature review, we identify a number of considerations for Earth observation using MPCDs such as methods of field collection, collecting measurements over broad areas, errors and biases, data processing, and accessibility of data. Developing effective frameworks for mobile data collection with public participation and strategies for minimizing bias, in combination with advancements in image processing techniques, will offer opportunities to collect Earth sensing data across a range of scales and perspectives, complimenting airborne and spaceborne remote sensing measurements.}

abstract = {Background
Urban planners frequently neglect the role of subjective risk perception during urban cycling. Several findings suggest a complex relationship between the risk of being involved in a crash and the subjective anticipation of this risk.
Data collection and methods
We investigate the relation of objective risks (operationalized through crashes involving cyclists) and subjective risk perception (operationalized through citizens’ reports in a crowdsourcing project) in a medium-sized German city. Using GIS methods, these datasets are linked to various infrastructure and traffic properties that have been found relevant for cycling safety.
Results
Despite a generally high alignment of objective and subjective risk, our findings highlight that the subjective risk perception at a given location can deviate significantly from the actual crash risk. For example, the subjective perception of high risk on one-way streets with bikeways in opposing direction is not matched by a high level of objective risk. Vice versa, some rather dangerous situations (e.g., tram stops) are not perceived as particularly dangerous.
Conclusions
Understanding why and where cyclists over- or underestimate the actual crash risk may provide a foundation for the design of safer cycling infrastructures, as well as for promoting cycling as a comfortable mode of transportation.}

Such areas often have high exposure to the general public, and receive a large number of visits. As a result, urban AOI can reveal useful information for city planners, transportation analysts, and location-based service providers to plan new business, extend existing infrastructure, and so forth. Urban AOI exist in people's perception and are defined by behaviors. However, such perception was rarely captured until the Social Web information technology revolution. Social media data record the interactions between users and their surrounding environment, and thus have the potential to uncover interesting urban areas and their underlying spatiotemporal dynamics. This paper presents a coherent framework for extracting and understanding urban AOI based on geotagged photos. Six different cities from six different countries have been selected for this study, and Flickr photo data covering these cities in the past ten years (2004–2014) have been retrieved. We identify AOI using DBSCAN clustering algorithm, understand AOI by extracting distinctive textual tags and preferable photos, and discuss the spatiotemporal dynamics as well as some insights derived from the AOI. An interactive prototype has also been implemented as a proof-of-concept. While Flickr data have been used in this study, the presented framework can also be applied to other geotagged photos.}

This study uses geographical ‘big data’ on point of interest density (POID), degree of urban function mixing (MIX), location check-in density (CIQD), housing prices (HP), and population change (POPC) to measure the urban vitality of patches of new development that occurred in Chinese cities from 2005 to 2015. The study uses association rule analysis to explore the relationship between different urban growth patterns on urban vitality, and the results indicate that different forms of urban growth have different effects on urban vitality. Infilling is characterized by high values for point of interest density and location check-in density with low values for urban function mixing and mixed values for population change. Edge-expansion is associated with high values for population change and urban function mixtures. Outlying expansion is associated with several negative values for urban vitality, particularly variables related to interactions between people and the environment around them (CIQD). The results indicate that cities may utilize these different forms of urban growth patterns to achieve different goals; for example, infilling may be more effective for office-style development in areas with existing higher population density and urban function mixtures, and edge-expansion may be effective for rapidly absorbing large populations and hosting urban functions that require larger footprints. As such, Chinese cities currently undergoing early stages of development should pursue high-intensity edge-expansion development. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first attempt to study the relationship between urban expansion types and urban vitality through the use of ‘big data,’ and the results of this study can provide guidance on urban spatial development for government leaders and researchers in the future.}

We evaluate the two approaches using empirical PPGIS data for the Chugach National Forest planning process where both approaches were implemented in spring of 2012. Results from a larger PPGIS survey completed in 1998 were also included in the study for comparison. We examined the spatial concurrence of the data generated by the two approaches (workshop versus survey) on multiple spatial attributes (landscape values) using three analytical methods—subsampling, resampling, and hotspot analysis. We found little to weak spatial association from the two participatory mapping methods on most landscape values. These results may be attributed to less spatial data for the workshops and to differences in measurement and sampling between the two approaches. The empirical results of low spatial concurrence raise important questions about the use of workshop participatory GIS for planning decision support. We discuss the implications and supporting rationale for using participatory mapping in community meetings.}

abstract = {The year 2014 marked the rapid expansion of big data in urban studies and planning practices in China. Big data has advantages of revealing individual characteristics rather than a general feature by traditional statistics, and it is consistent with the idea of people-oriented urbanization and urban–rural planning. The research progress of big data since 2000 in China is reviewed in this paper. Focusing on behavior big data mining and big data application in urban studies and planning practices, the review is proposed from four parts, involving behavior data acquisition & analysis, spatial analysis, plan making & management application and new methodologies with big data. Lastly, some open research issues such as potential challenges and possible directions of development are discussed.}

abstract = {The climate resilience of nations is imperative for a sustainable future. The way that nations respond to climate change needs to adapt from a reactive and backward-focused disaster management approach, to become more proactive and to anticipate what is yet to come. Two key challenges restrict climate resilience. First, the social aspects are relevant to resilience, yet many such aspects are not adequately reflected by available statistics. Second, validating indicators of climate resilience is demanding in terms of data availability and methodology. To overcome these challenges, we develop an Empirical Evidence Resilience Index (EERI) based on the Emergency Event Data Base (EM-DAT) to measure resilience. However, just the measurement of resilience does not provide the explanation necessary to determine planning strategies. Therefore, to understand resilience better, we also use statistics from OpenStreetMap (OSM) to predict the EERI and deduce explanatory elements. This step is achieved with a random forest method. We call the resulting prediction of resilience (EERI) from OSM data the Open Resilience Index (ORI). The used explanatory elements from OSM not only cover the physical characteristics of infrastructures, but also include country-level socio-economic information. The results show the relevance of social cohesion (identity & mobility; religion); human development (leisure & recreation, social fabric); economy (economic status; material supply); sustainable infrastructure (available infrastructure; spatial development); and nature conservation for resilience.}

It is the only farmers market directory that provides the geographical coordinates of market locations and allows the public to download the dataset at no cost. The geographic coordinates of the market locations in the directory were collected through a web-based GIS data collection form. This form allows market managers to navigate, review, and adjust market locations on the web-based map, and to save the coordinates of the market locations into the database. However, market location addresses and descriptions provided by users are in an open-ended format, which did not allow automatic verification of the accuracy of a market location. In using the web-based GIS to capture market coordinates, deficiencies in users' computer literacy skills, attention to details, Internet speed, etc. means spatial errors in market locations coordinates were possible. Hence, the directory data, including market location coordinates, has to be validated before it is delivered to the public. This study developed a method to verify the coordinates of farmers market locations by comparing user-generated market coordinates against the geocoded coordinates from multiple geocoding services based on user-submitted market addresses. Using the USDA 2012 National Farmers Market Directory as a test dataset, three-quarters of the market locations generated by farmers market managers were verified as the ground-truth locations. This study suggests that multiple geocoding services provide a feasible and practical method for validating user-generated farmers market locations.}

Though an effective involvement of users in multidimensional modeling is crucial in these projects, not much has been said about how to establish a fruitful collaboration in projects involving numerous users with different skills, reputations, and degrees of authority. This issue is especially relevant in citizen science projects, where several volunteers can contribute their requirements despite not being formally-trained experts in the application domain. To fill this gap, we propose a framework for collaborative multidimensional modeling that can adapt itself to the profiles and skills of the actors involved. We first classify users depending on their authoritativeness, skills, and engagement in the project. Then, following this classification, we identify four possible methodological scenarios and propose a profile-aware methodology supported by two sets of quality attributes. Finally, we describe a Group Decision Support System that implements our methodological framework and present some experiments carried out on a real case study.}

This paper introduces socio-technical transitions theory and multi-level perspective (MLP) framework in particular as a way to structure potential pathways for cadastral systems. The approach emphasizes the role of institutional rules of the game – the regulative, normative and cognitive institutional elements – in socio-technical transition processes. Using the Finnish cadastral system as a case study, we illustrate the approach by forming three alternative transition pathways: (1) a cadastral system under digital transformation, (2) differentiating urban and rural cadastral systems, and (3) a cadastral system facing new data management challenges. After describing each transition pathway with a narrative storyline, we reflect them in light of previous discourses of the cadastral domain. Thereby, the study provides new insights into discussions about the future of cadastral systems and land administration in general.}

Urban Energy Modeling including spatial parameters of urban forms and settlements can lead to more sustainable approaches in computational simulations. Moreover, scientific policy advice requires that models and data to be transparent and prepared in an unbiased manner. Hence, benchmarking the quality criteria of open source datasets like OpenStreetMap (OSM) data is needed. This contribution introduces UES modelling and its data requirements for different application sectors. Further, it extends and provides a first assessment of OSM data which is used in modeling energy systems in cities. This data was previously used in the context of a UES model developed by the authors. A main conclusion is that although many OSM features are missing and cannot be extracted from OSM, these datasets constitute a great source of open data which can contribute to a more sustainable and transparent modelling.}

abstract = {Identifying the fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure risk for bicycle riders is crucial for promoting the development of theory and technology in transportation-related air pollution assessment as well as urban health planning. Previous studies have employed daily mean PM2.5 concentrations and designed routes to evaluate air pollution exposure risk. However, because the daily mean PM2.5 concentrations cannot fully illustrate the intra-day variations in PM2.5, which are typically higher than daily mean values, the adverse effects of PM2.5 concentrations remain underestimated. Moreover, the quantity and representativeness of monitoring samples make large spatial-scale and multi-temporal-scale analysis challenging. By defining hourly exceedance PM2.5 concentration and sharing bicycle rider data, two novel indicators were proposed in our study: exceedance exposure risk of PM2.5 for sharing bicycle riders (EPSR) and accumulative exceedance exposure risk of PM2.5 for sharing bicycle riders (AEPSR). Standard deviation ellipse analysis was conducted to investigate the multi-temporal variation of ESPR and AEPSR. A geographically weighted regression model was applied to quantify the relationship between city function zones and exceedance PM2.5 exposure risk for sharing bicycle riders. Results revealed that the mean values of EPSR and AEPSR during morning peak periods ranged between 0.109 min μg/m3 and 1.27 min μg/m3 and 6.83 min μg/m3 and 43.41 min μg/m3, respectively, whereas the mean values of EPSR and AEPSR during evening peak periods ranged between 0.19 min μg/m3 and 4.28 min μg/m3 and 14.67 min μg/m3 and 357.66 min μg/m3, respectively. This implied that sharing bicycle riders were exposed to higher PM2.5-related risks during the evening than in the morning. When considering the accumulative effects, the average centers of the AEPSR moved to the north side as compared to the average centers of the EPSR. Expanding areas of EPSR shrunk by 20.25 km2. This indicated that accumulative effects aggregated spatial clusters of exceedance PM2.5 exposure risk for sharing bicycle riders more tightly to the north of the study areas. Spatiotemporal variation of EPSR and AEPSR led us to investigate the mechanism behind this phenomenon. Spatial associations between city function zones and EPSR and AEPSR showed that sharing bicycle riders experienced more severe exceedance PM2.5 exposure risk around financial/corporations and leisure service areas, with R2 values of 0.33 and 0.35, respectively. This spatial association tended to be more significant during the evening peak periods. By developing two novel indicators, the increasing health threats for bicycle riders caused by exceedance PM2.5 were investigated in this study. The mechanism results should be included for developing mitigation strategies to alleviate the adverse effects of air pollution for public rider participators and achieving the goal of eco-health cities.}

There is a need for capacity enhancement for community-based natural resource planning and management in the Territory. A number of frameworks are emerging for addressing change brought on by resource development and building resilience to such change at the community level. Among these include the concept of adaptive capacity. In collaboration with FN community leaders, we explored the use of “collaborative geomatics” tools to foster adaptive capacity. Our action research suggests that collaborative geomatics technologies should enhance the Mushkegowuk First Nations’ adaptive capacity to address environmental and policy change by allowing them to collect and manage data collaboratively (e.g., traditional environmental knowledge, western science) to create opportunities for innovative community development, including natural resource development and management.}

A methodology is developed to organize and visualize the results of visual screening method with a GIS-oriented database system. Throughout the study, the primary rationale behind conducting the field data collection via utilization of spatial processes is to achieve a standardized and efficient data flow in the presence of multiple data collectors on the field, working in coordination. Incorporated in the process are mobile data collection tools with cloud-support, open online spatial databases, and open-source GIS software. The utilization of these tools instead of paper forms would lead to readily available standardized responses via digital forms, avoiding loss and fragmentation of data and ambiguities in classification, where multiple users contribute to the same repository. In addition, the use of digital tools in field data collection eliminates the data transcription process, significantly reducing the time required for it. Hence, the proposed framework has the potential to represent a fast and reliable overview of structural seismic vulnerability as well as seismic priority for strengthening. As a result of this study, the mobile data transmission in the field and the visualization in GIS are highly recommended to be a standard part of the seismic evaluation procedure.}

Both user groups found the concept useful, but its potential impact was less for the pushchair user group. There were mixed views in relation to the ability of the mashup to convey the trustworthiness, credibility and reliability of information necessary for journey planning. The study identified a number of key information-related user requirements which help enable effective design of user contributed web-based resources for travellers with mobility-related issues.}

Remote sensing technologies were used for data collection during disasters. However, due to the large areas affected by major disasters such as Hurricane Matthew, specific data cannot be collected in time such as the location information. Social media can serve as a crowdsourcing platform for citizens’ communication and information sharing during natural disasters and provide the timely data for identifying affected areas to support rapid damage assessment during disasters. Nevertheless, there is very limited existing research on the utility of social media data in damage assessment. Even though some investigation of the relationship between social media activities and damages was conducted, the employment of damage-related social media data in exploring the fore-mentioned relationship remains blank. This paper, for the first time, establishes the index dictionary by semantic analysis for the identification of damage-related tweets posted during Hurricane Matthew in Florida. Meanwhile, the insurance claim data from the publication of Florida Office of Insurance Regulation is used as a representative of real hurricane damage data in Florida. This study performs a correlation analysis and a comparative analysis of the geographic distribution of social media data and damage data at the county level in Florida. We find that employing social media data to identify critical affected areas at the county level during disasters is viable. Damage data has a closer relationship with damage-related tweets than disaster-related tweets.}

The problem of finding a set of travel plans which realizes a set of CDR trajectories and is consistent with a set of link volume counts is rephrased in terms of calibrating a choice model. This enables us to make use of an existing calibration scheme for agent-oriented simulations. We demonstrate our approach by an illustrative scenario with synthetic data.}

abstract = {This study delves into the development of a Geographic Information System (GIS) based vulnerability assessment tool for assessing coastal vulnerability and making prescriptive recommendations on urban planning in coastal regions at a local level. The framework of “exposure-sensitivity-resilience” (ESR) is not only applied, but also improved and refined to take into account a suite of social-ecological indicators. The results demonstrate that vulnerability was not evenly distributed across Haikou's coastal zones, which may be linked to the different stages of ongoing urban planning for coastal Haikou. For the case study areas, vulnerability tends to increase with higher levels of urbanization, but may decrease once the speed of urban expansion is under control. The most vulnerable area is the main city zone where urban residents are concentrated and a developed transportation network exists. Our study contributes to the development of a general methodology to assess vulnerability in rapid urbanization and to apply it to coastal cities around the world.}

In this study, we harness state-of-the-art datasets to model cyclists’ route choice based on a case study of the City of Glasgow, Scotland. First, the social fitness network Strava was used to obtain datasets containing the number of cycling trips on each street intersection for the years 2017 and 2018. Second, we employed a Python toolkit to acquire and analyse the street networks. OSMnx was subsequently employed to quantify several commonly used centrality indices (degree, eigenvector, betweenness and closeness) to measure street layout. Due to the presence of spatial dependence, a spatial error model was used to model route choices. Model results demonstrate that: (1) cyclists’ movement models were consistent for the years 2017 and 2018; (2) the presence of a spillover effect suggests that cyclists tend to cycle in proximity to each other; and (3) cyclists avoid streets with high degree centrality values and prefer streets with high eigenvector centrality, betweenness centrality and closeness centrality. These findings reveal cyclists’ desired street layouts and can be taken into consideration for future interventions.}

abstract = {Rural areas in Poland are inhabited by 39.8 % of the country’s population (GUS (Statistics Poland), 2018a). These areas face various challenges related to the development of efficient and competitive agriculture and forest management, while also strengthening their structures as viable living spaces for rural citizens that enable independent life and varied economic activity. Another important challenge arising in this context is preservation of the cultural landscape and natural environment of these areas. Measures to improve rural development instruments have been pursued in Poland for more than a decade. Rural Development Programme for 2014-2020, setting a framework for the development of rural areas in Poland, highlights the need to activate their residents, and to use endogenic potentials to foster local development. The process of spatial planning within rural areas in Poland requires measures promoting creativity among rural residents and enabling their involvement in joint projects. One of the objectives of current rural development projects is to incorporate citizen perspectives within the process of local development. This research aims to identify potential measures that local governments can implement to develop local identity and the sense of belonging. The emergence of Web 2.0 and the release of public application programming interfaces (APIs) for online mapping tools and sites that enable uploading georeferenced content, along with the introduction of mobile location tagging devices, brought a wide range of new possibilities, challenges, and perspectives for rural development. Crowdsourcing - a type of participative online activity - is one of them. It allows effective targeting of relevant social groups, benefitting from their knowledge of the area, their opinions and ideas, and then involving them in the implementation of the planning works, thus enabling exchange of reflections and views among authorities, experts, and the public (“crowd”). Crowdsourcing entails a combination of top-down, traditional, hierarchical process, and a bottom-up, open process engaging an online community. The analysis of trends observed in European policies (such as Collective Awareness Platforms for Sustainability and Social Innovation [CAPs] projects) has revealed that the mobilization of public engagement in land use planning is both desirable and important. The article presents possibilities to introduce the crowdsourcing concept into rural development programmes in Poland, particularly in planning works related to the implementation of land consolidation. A dedicated application LC-CApp (Land Consolidation-Crowdsourcing Application) was created in the GIS environment specifically for this purpose.}

Spatial information on six landscape values in a biodiversity hotspot, the Camargue Biosphere Reserve (southern France) was collected from 113 participants through surveys, interviews and workshops. This data was geo-located through a SoftGIS methodology to map and quantify the overlap of bivariate hotspots identifying value concurrence. The most frequent values recorded through total number of polygons and surface areas were wilderness and recreation. The least frequently mapped values were economic loss and biodiversity. There was frequent concurrence between biodiversity and aesthetic values especially in wetlands (lagoons, salt flats and sea). There was also frequent concurrence between biodiversity and recreational values with more overlap in sites with easy access (along roads and public areas). Our results show that using an iconic species is an effective way to render explicit spatial variations in the values attributed to a landscape and to identify concurrence of values, thus enabling integration of multiple landscape values in conservation planning.}

However, it extends and differs from purely qualitative research by integrating additional qualitative, quantitative, and multiple methodology techniques to investigate complex scenarios in a natural setting. Naturalistic inquiry provides the human geographer with a paradigm and context within which to conduct research in natural settings involving complex interactions between humans, society, and their environment. The naturalistic methodology assumes specific philosophical approaches that inform and guide its implementation. These include multiple constructed realities that can only be studied holistically, and the researcher and the subject of inquiry influence one another. Due to these limitations, the inquiry aims to develop a case-based, idiographic body of knowledge in the form of a collection of data or a working hypothesis. This approach explicitly acknowledges that all inquiry, including the biases and power relations of the researcher in framing the questions, the theory, paradigms, and approach behind the research, is value-laden. Naturalistic inquiry provides the human geographer with a paradigm and context within which to conduct research in natural settings involving complex interactions among humans, society, and their environment. It fits within the recent debates about practicing geography, the ethics of doing research, and a framework for establishing and clarifying whom the research is on, by, for, or with. Naturalistic Inquiry is becoming more salient to human geography, as it affords a methodology to understand how different and diverse groups share familiar places and spaces. The research operates in an iterative process to establish credibility, transferability, and dependability.}

However, methodological frameworks for informing urban regeneration at a fine-grain neighborhood scale through LBSNs is still by and large an unchartered territory, which this research seeks to address. This research bridges the knowledge gap by proposing a method to identify urban opportunity spaces for urban regeneration that involves pre-processing, analyzing and interpreting single and overlapped LBSN data. A two-fold perspective—people-based and place-based—is adopted. Data from four LBSNs—Foursquare, Twitter, Google Places and Airbnb—represent the people-based approach as it offers an insight into individual preferences, use and activities. The place-based approach is provided by an illustrative case study. Local unexpected nuances were gathered by the interlinking of data from different LBSNs, and opportunity places for urban regeneration have been recognized, as well as potential itineraries to boost urban liveliness and connectivity at both intra and inter- neighborhood scales. Findings show that overlapping data from various LBSNs enriches the analysis that would previously have relied on a single source.}

The aim is to compare different methods, both quantitative and qualitative, and to assess which are more cost effective rather than detail the process of recovery after particular events. The paper also discusses how resilience relates to recovery. The methods trialled are all capable of measuring the speed, and to some extent the quality, of recovery, but the merits of each depends on the resources available and the level of detail or precision required. The recommended approach is to use the methods in combination. Specifically satellite imagery analysis can be combined with ground survey, social audit and published data to develop a spatial-temporal geo-database that can be used to monitor recovery. To date, however, it would appear to be challenging to measure resilience. An approach might be to attempt to isolate the factors underlying resilience and focus on measuring these. This might be achieved by analysing recovery after a wide variety of events and building models of resilience based on these factors. These predictions of resiliencey for a wide range of countries at risk might then be compared with the speed and quality recovery after future events.}

This article aims to propose a formal modeling approach helps facilitate decision making about navigation pathways. The proposed data model is based on an objective orientation idea. City features, such as street features, buildings and environmental areas, are organized as a series of function objects that meet the various needs of the blind. They are linked by paths with obstacles and irregular surface objects. A complex function object is composed of several inner function objects and paths; thus, it can reflect the spatial layout at various levels. Detailed semantic content can be added into the objects as an extension that enhances the representation and facilitates spatial learning. The geometric shapes of the proposed objects and their topological information are also recorded for local navigation and comprehensive path planning. To examine the usability of the data model, a prototype system was developed using the Chinese university of Hong Kong as a study area, and test cases are illustrated for a typical designed scenario.}

The open data movement promises to address this gap by offering alternative sources for information and free or low cost analytical platforms. However, in order to use open data effectively, urban managers and planners need guidance to navigate these new data sources, software, and server platforms, as well as acquire the necessary skills. In this paper, we begin to address these issues by developing a framework that organizes the sprawling and rapidly evolving world of open urban data. Our framework includes three broad categories (1) inputs and resources, (2) activities and outputs, and (3) outcomes. We then identify and describe the key subcomponents under each, and list the prominent products and resources available to urban managers and planners. For example, under inputs and resources, we discuss open urban data sources such as Open Street Maps, cyberinfrastructure for web hosting, application deployment, and data processing, and open source software that can be used to analyze and visualize collected or derived data. We also identify the key resources available to planners for training and discuss the complementary opportunities presented by conventional datasets such as census and open urban data. Finally, using examples from ongoing activities in Mumbai, we show how open data resources can be useful for understanding urbanization and better integrating informal settlements into formal urban management and planning processes. We suggest that urban managers and planners working in informal settlements should take greater advantage of open data resources in order to both better address current challenges as well as for shaping a better future for the communities they serve.}

Haptics is increasingly important to human geography, for its power to represent information, connect people separated by distance, and improve the quality of interaction and immersion with media used to represent geographic information. Haptics refers to touch in the widest sense, including the sensing of information from the skin as well as the movement and position of joints, limbs, and fingers. Touch can be regarded as a mechanism for gaining knowledge about the environment from the things we are able to touch directly, and through models and representations of geographic space that are designed to be experienced and interacted with through touch. Objects that are physically, tangibly sensed via touching would include tactile maps, three-dimensional models, and touch-based representations in virtual reconstructions. Virtual reality simulations are manipulated and interacted with through touch and through force feedback in haptic-based virtual reality. Manipulating objects leads to the acquisition and development of the abilities to learn geographic space, and is a precursor to complex understanding of spatial arrangements. Although there are limitations to any sense, touch provides a critical embodied relationship between an individual and his/her proximal environment. The central nature of touch to our sensory relationship with the world means that touch is so intuitive as to go unnoticed. Our bodies are touched and being touched by the immediacy of our surroundings. The chair that we sit in, the feel of the ground underfoot, and the reciprocal sensing of a road as we drive a car, all provide evidence that touch is the most central and essential of all our senses. To paraphrase the philosopher Bertrand Russell, touch gives us our sense of “reality,” our whole conception of what exists outside us is based upon the sense of touch.}

Our responses to graffiti range from recognition of artistry, to interpreting it as a sign of urban decay and disorder. Major cities respond to tax-payers with this latter response by providing graffiti abatement programs, often at substantial cost; thus, understanding and mitigating the causes of graffiti has tangible value. Using spatial analysis, we explore the combined causes of graffiti creation and the subsequent reporting of graffiti for removal in San Francisco, CA, USA. Using a combination of census data and city data, we identify five factors that have significant correlation to graffiti reports, and use them to build a regression model. We show that graffiti is created in areas with high densities of young males, and that commercial zones have the highest rate of graffiti reports. We show that a Geographically Weighted Regression model of these five factors explains over two-thirds of the variation in graffiti reports in San Francisco. Further, our findings are consistent with the dual hypotheses of graffiti as a form of communication or advertising aimed at a target market of other young males, along with the broken window thesis of graffiti interpreted as a sign of social disorder.}

These early attempts provide us with only narrow visibility of multidimensional well-being but prove to us that mart well-being measurement systems are possible—and useful—to build.

abstract = {The recent explosive publications of big data studies have well documented the rise of big data and its ongoing prevalence. Different types of “big data” have emerged and have greatly enriched spatial information sciences and related fields in terms of breadth and granularity. Studies that were difficult to conduct in the past time due to data availability can now be carried out. However, big data brings lots of “big errors” in data quality and data usage, which cannot be used as a substitute for sound research design and solid theories. We indicated and summarized the problems faced by current big data studies with regard to data collection, processing and analysis: inauthentic data collection, information incompleteness and noise of big data, unrepresentativeness, consistency and reliability, and ethical issues. Cases of empirical studies are provided as evidences for each problem. We propose that big data research should closely follow good scientific practice to provide reliable and scientific “stories”, as well as explore and develop techniques and methods to mitigate or rectify those ‘big-errors’ brought by big data.}

abstract = {Computational human geography refers to the use of computational methods and techniques to solve problems in human geography research and applications. The approach goes back to the beginnings of the quantitative revolution in geography and is philosophically related though methodologically distinct from it. Geographic information systems (GIS) and science are a big part of computational human geography, but the latter notion is considerably broader, encompassing spatial process modeling and simulation, the modeling of spatial decision and behavior, visualization techniques, spatial analysis, and an increasing number of new research areas and methods enabled by the most recent technological developments. The latter are discussed under the rubrics of The Data Revolution, Urban (Spatial) Informatics, and Ambient Computing. Two major thrusts have persisted throughout the years: the use of numerical techniques to solve large, complex quantitative problems; the development of models of complex spatial processes expressed directly in computational terms. Both have evolved with the times and continue to be central to computational human geography. Critiques originate from both within the field and from the humanities and social theory perspectives. These address epistemological and methodological problems as well as issues of ontology and representation.}

Of special interest is the need to ensure that indigenous and traditional knowledge is effectively integrated into spatial data infrastructures and that northern peoples have the infrastructure to take full advantage of the power of geographic information management. This chapter will also consider other challenges for Cybercartography such as the growing individualization of mapping technologies that have design, and legal and ethical implications, the need to preserve cultural heritage, and the need to scale up Cybercartography in the era of big data.}

To discern emerging patterns in citizen science-based studies on topics with relevance for sustainable agriculture and reveal salient challenges and opportunities for conducting such studies, we conducted a literature review of 27 articles from the period 2004–2019 of 250 publications screened from Google Scholar. These articles were thematically grouped under the topics: Soil health, climate adaptation, pest/pathogen monitoring, invasive species, inputs and outputs and pollination. Participants’ characteristics, motivations, study design and project outcomes in the reviewed articles were summarized and discussed. Both observational and experimental studies were represented in the articles, while emerging trends point towards field experimentation and ‘Large-N′ trials by lay farmers. Crowdsourcing lends itself to projects where the main role of the public is local visual observations and reporting, such as in pest/pathogen monitoring. Challenges included methodological issues such as validation procedures, but above all motivation, recruitment, and retention of volunteers. Despite the importance of participatory approaches for deeper citizen involvement for sustainability transitions and for the quality of knowledge outcomes, the role of citizens was overall restricted to data collection. Several of the methodologies proposed would be difficult to implement in low-income countries, and relatively few studies pertained to agricultural concerns of the global South. To lend value to farmers' time, we recommend projects relevant to livelihoods, health issues or local farming problems, accompanied by well-structured data feedback protocols, routing study results back to farmers.}

abstract = {Regarding suburbanisation, land policies in many countries have undergone profound changes over the past 20 years. While experiencing high growth rates of urban land, policies were reconsidered and adapted with the goal of limiting land consumption in favour of a more sustainable urban development. These changes aim at a higher effectiveness in steering urbanisation processes to limit environmental impacts, but also are criticized regarding possible effects on a sufficient supply of housing. To this regard, also German urban planning policies show considerable dynamics. After several urban containment policies were introduced, the question arises on how to empirically assess their effects. Therefore, monitoring approaches with a regional perspective become more and more relevant, as polycentric, suburban settlement structures constitute the spatial but also institutional context of urban containment policies. Considering suburbanisation as a global phenomenon, we develop a monitoring approach, which allows for a quantitative and qualitative assessment within suburban settlement structures. We propose a set of indicators that integrates urban structure, regional accessibility and usage by population. As data is scarce for a city-regional perspective, we combine geospatial methods for an automatic identification of building types from topographic data and maps, for measuring multi-modal accessibility and for small scale demographic analysis. The approach is applied to the case of a German city-region with splintered planning institutions. The results of the small-scale, but also comprehensive regional analysis allow for a detailed discussion of effects of policy changes on the settlement structure.}

However, these data come with specific challenges and one of the major concerns is maintaining the privacy of data subjects. One widely used approach to anonymise the data is to apply binning. Recently, data from activity-tracking applications like Strava has been utilised to study and analyse active travel. Due to privacy concerns, Strava has started providing data in a discretised format from July 2018. In this study, we aim to analyse the impact of the binning criteria on the utility of the crowdsourced data by using Strava data from 2013 to 2016 for the city of Glasgow. We applied the Strava binning criteria on the original dataset at three different temporal aggregations (i.e., Hourly, Daily and Monthly) and conducted different analyses to examine its impacts. First, we compared manual cycling counts with original and binned cycling counts from Strava data. Second, net-errors were calculated by comparing original and binned cycling counts from Strava data. Third, we estimated spatial autocorrelation statistics based on original and binned Strava counts and investigated the extent to which research outcomes change because of the binning approach. Our results confirmed significant amount of information loss. Worryingly, we also show that conclusions reached by previous studies could have been reversed if the new specification of the data had been used. We outline here what precautions researchers and planners should take when working with the binned data.}

Previous studies have relied on low-throughput surveys and limited data sources, which have difficulty in measuring the human perception of a large-scale urban region at flexible spatial resolutions. In this work, a data-driven machine learning approach is proposed to measure how people perceive a place in a large-scale urban region. Specifically, a deep learning model, which has been trained on millions of human ratings of street-level imagery, was used to predict human perceptions of a street view image. The model achieved a high accuracy rate in predicting six human perceptual indicators, namely, safe, lively, beautiful, wealthy, depressing, and boring. This model can help to map the distribution of the city-wide human perception for a new urban region. Furthermore, a series of statistical analyses was conducted to determine the visual elements that may cause a place to be perceived as different perceptions. From the 150 object categories segmented from the street view images, various objects were identified as being positively or negatively correlated with each of the six perceptual indicators. The results take researchers and urban planners one step toward understanding the interactions of the place sentiments and semantics.}

The largest tracts of ecologically most valuable roadless areas refer to large unfragmented forests regions, both in the tropics and the boreal zone (Amazon, Congo basin, East and Southeast Asia). Among all terrestrial ecosystems, roadless forests are the single most important strongholds of regulating ecosystem services: among others, soil protection, water retention, buffering of the local and regional climate and mitigation of global climate change via capturing of atmospheric carbon. But roadless areas also comprise much demanded natural resource assets, such as timber, often also minerals and space for agricultural development. There is a substantial conflict between diverse short-term economic interests and the long-term conservation of roadless areas. Large roadless areas can serve as a measurable surrogate for the most pristine and functional ecosystems. Roadlessness is a property of areas, which are not impacted by roads; it can be used as a proxy for assessing ecosystem integrity and the absence of many anthropogenic disturbances. We recommend that policy-makers give roadless areas conservation priority over areas that have already been fragmented. It is essential to establish roadlessness as a criterion for the planning of ecosystem-based, cost-effective sustainable development. In parallel with measures to protect roadlessness, we recommend alternative approaches to mobility that can work under roadless conditions, e.g., related to railroads, blimps and other low-energy technologies with low infrastructure requirements. Even if “climate-friendly” renewable energy was available for road transport on a large scale, the construction, existence and operation of roads would continue to severely impair ecosystem functionality.}

Online tools can facilitate this and overcome barriers to landholder engagement in collaborative management. However, collaborative online tools need to be designed and tailored to users' needs and values, and landholder participation in the development process is critical to ensuring uptake and long-term use. This article presents a case study from the Central Tablelands region of New South Wales, Australia, where landholders have been involved in participatory development of a new online collaboration tool. The case study results highlight the significance of issues such as internet access, privacy, technical proficiency and differing stakeholder objectives. A landholder survey identified mapping and the uploading of monitoring data as important functions for the online tool, but these were not rated as highly as functions relating to data security, sharing settings and key term searches. Consequently, we recommend that a future online collaboration tool for the region is not framed specifically as a mapping or citizen science tool, but rather as an adaptive collaboration and communication tool that can incorporate a variety of data types and formats and be modified over time in line with changing landholder needs.}

Different from the ordinary 3D objects in computer graphics, polygons in 3D city objects are usually correlated e.g. parallel to each other or nearly located in the same plane. Therefore, PCA can reduce the data volume efficiently. According to the experimental results, the proposed method can compress the 3D city models by 95% while preserving the overall similarity between the simplified and original models.}

An empirical approach to map apparent temperature at the neighborhood scale, which relies on publicly available weather station observations and spatial data layers combined in a random forest regression model, was demonstrated for greater Vancouver, Canada. Model errors were acceptable (cross-validated RMSE=2.04°C) and the resulting map of apparent temperature, calibrated for a typical hot summer day, corresponded well with past temperature research in the area. A comparison with field measurements as well as similar maps of skin temperature and air temperature revealed that skin temperature was poorly correlated with both air temperature (R2=0.38) and apparent temperature (R2=0.39). While the latter two were more similar (R2=0.87), apparent temperature was predicted to exceed air temperature by more than 5°C in several urban areas as well as around the confluence of the Pitt and Fraser rivers. We conclude that skin temperature is not a suitable proxy for human heat exposure, and that spatial epidemiology studies could benefit from mapping apparent temperature, using an approach similar to the one reported here, to better quantify differences in heat exposure that exist across an urban landscape.}

Remote sensing imagery with largescale coverage and accurate target descriptions, has been regarded as an ideal solution for monitoring the urban environment. However, due to the heterogeneity of remote sensing images, it is difficult to access their geographical content at the object level, let alone understanding urban scenes at the block level. Recently, deep learning-based strategies have been applied to interpret urban scenes with remarkable accuracies. However, the deep neural networks require a substantial number of training samples which are hard to satisfy, especially for high-resolution images. Meanwhile, the crowed-sourced Open Street Map (OSM) data provides rich annotation information about the urban targets but may encounter the problem of insufficient sampling (limited by the places where people can go). As a result, the combination of OSM and remote sensing images for efficient urban scene recognition is urgently needed. In this paper, we present a novel strategy to transfer existing OSM data to high-resolution images for semantic element determination and urban scene understanding. To be specific, the object-based convolutional neural network (OCNN) can be utilized for geographical object detection by feeding it rich semantic elements derived from OSM data. Then, geographical objects are further delineated into their functional labels by integrating points of interest (POIs), which contain rich semantic terms, such as commercial or educational labels. Lastly, the categories of urban scenes are easily acquired from the semantic objects inside. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method has an ability to classify complex urban scenes. The classification accuracies of the Beijing dataset are as high as 91% at the object-level and 88% at the scene level. Additionally, we are probably the first to investigate the object level semantic mapping by incorporating high-resolution images and OSM data of urban areas. Consequently, the method presented is effective in delineating urban scenes that could further boost urban environment monitoring and planning with high-resolution images.}

abstract = {This paper presents the case of Cartagena de Indias, a well-known international touristic destination in Colombia, which experiences serious problems of traffic congestion and accessibility to the city center. Promoting pedestrian mobility is one of the public administration’s main goals, by enhancing and re-designing different pedestrian paths. Designing pedestrian zones is a context-specific multifaceted problem that involves multiple stakeholders and multiple criteria. A participatory multicriteria approach based on the Analytic Network Process (ANP) has been used to understand the most important characteristics affecting pedestrian mobility in Cartagena de Indias, thus deriving a useful decision-support tool for planning and designing pedestrian paths. In this respect, in this paper a set of streets in the city center has been evaluated, by combining the results of ANP with spatial data using Geographic Information Systems (GIS), producing thematic maps and an index of pedestrian priority to derive a priority of intervention. Some streets have been redesigned with the aim to increase their walking attractiveness. Results put the basis for discussion with local administration and stakeholders to validate them and propose further applications of the methodology.}

abstract = {Maritime Spatial Planning (MSP) is an effective tool for conciliating human activities and environmental values, building on spatial data and geoinformation technologies. However, socio-economic information is distinctly underrepresented in the rapidly growing supply of spatial information. The spatial distribution of current and future activities and opinions has traditionally been the silent information of scientists, local actors and the public. Moreover, future projections and policies exist in qualitative, non-spatial formats, incompatible with quantitative biophysical spatial data layers. This article aims at promoting the generation and application of spatial socio-economic information for the purposes of MSP. We examine one workflow of converting the socio-economic knowledge of individual experts to spatial data, and further to refined spatial knowledge. We illustrate how participatory mapping, data interpretation and core geocomputing methods may be used to generate data, and discuss the main issues related to their generation and use. The results suggest that participatory mapping can provide valuable data for the MSP process, helping in filling the gap of missing socio-economic information. The process is highly subjective: the presentation of background information, the framing of the questions and the interpretation of the spatial data may have notable influence on the generated information. Furthermore, both the technology of the data collection and applied analysis methods have distinct effects on spatial information and its validity.}

Many people prefer to bike on facilities separated from motor vehicles, such as multiuse trails. However, due to underreporting, cities lack data on bike collisions, especially along greenways and multiuse paths. We used a crowdsourced cycling incident dataset (2005–2016) from BikeMaps.org for the Capital Regional District (CRD), BC, Canada. Our goal was to identify design characteristics associated with unsafe intersections between multiuse trails and roads. 92.8% of mapped incidents occurred between 2014 and 2016. We extracted both collision and near miss incidents at intersections from BikeMaps.org. We conducted site observations at 32 intersections where a major multiuse trail intersected with roads. We compared attributes of reported incidents at multiuse trail-road intersections to those at road-road intersections. We then used negative binomial regression to model the relationship between the number of incidents and the infrastructure characteristics at multiuse trail-road intersections. We found a higher proportion of collisions (38%, or 17/45 total reports) at multiuse trail-road intersections compared to road-road intersections (23%, or 62/268 total reports). A higher proportion of incidents resulted in an injury at multiuse trail-road intersections compared to road-road intersections (33% versus 15%). Cycling volumes, vehicle volumes, and trail sight distance were all associated with incident frequency at multiuse trail–road intersections. Supplementing traditional crash records with crowdsourced cycling incident data provides valuable evidence on cycling safety at intersections between multiuse trails and roads, and more generally, when conflicts occur between diverse transportation modes.}

To identify the key issues and research priorities in PPGIS, two researchers that have designed and implemented more than 40 empirical studies spanning both environmental and urban applications present their views about the present and future of PPGIS for land use planning and management. This paper is intended to be a synthesis, but not necessarily a consensus of the key issues and research priorities. We have organized the paper into six general key issues and four priority research topics. The key issues are: (1) conceptual and theoretical foundations, (2) the diversity of definitions and approaches to participatory mapping, (3) the spatial attributes measured in participatory mapping, (4) sampling, participation, and data quality, (5) relationships between participatory mapped attributes and physical places, and (6) the integration of PPGIS data into planning decision support. Our top research priorities include: (1) understanding and increasing participation rates, (2) identifying and controlling threats to spatial data quality, (3) improving the “PP” or public participation in PPGIS, and (4) evaluating the effectiveness of PPGIS. Our purpose for presenting a research agenda is to stimulate discourse among PPGIS researchers and practitioners about future research needs and to provide support for the mobilization of resources to undertake future empirical research.}

The contributions of the presented research are two-fold. First, a comprehensive literature review was completed spanning the domains of Criminology/Crime Analysis and GIScience/Cartography to establish the current state of science on spatiotemporal crime analysis. This background review then was complemented with a set of interviews with personnel from seven intermediate- to large-size law enforcement agencies in the United States in order to establish the current state of practice of spatiotemporal crime analysis. The comparison of science and practice revealed a variety of insights into the current practice of spatiotemporal crime analysis as well as identified four broad, currently unmet needs: (1) improve access to externally maintained government datasets and allow for flexible and dynamic combination of these datasets; (2) place an emphasis on user interface design in order to improve the usability of crime mapping and analysis tools, (3) integrate geographic and temporal representations and analyses methods to better unlock insight into spatiotemporal criminal activity, and (4) improve support for strategic crime analysis and, ultimately, public safety policymaking and administration. The results of the interview study ultimately were used to inform the design and development of a spatiotemporal crime mapping application called GeoVISTA CrimeViz.}

On-going crowdsourcing initiatives in agriculture were analysed and categorised according to their crowdsourcing component. We identified eight types of agricultural data and information that can be generated from crowdsourcing initiatives. Subsequently we described existing methods of quality control of the crowdsourced data. We analysed the profiles of potential contributors in crowdsourcing initiatives in agriculture, suggested ways for increasing farmers’ participation, and discussed the on-going initiatives in the light of their target beneficiaries. While crowdsourcing is reported to be an efficient way of collecting observations relevant to environmental monitoring and contributing to science in general, we pointed out that crowdsourcing applications in agriculture may be hampered by privacy issues and other barriers to participation. Close connections with the farming sector, including extension services and farm advisory companies, could leverage the potential of crowdsourcing for both agricultural research and farming applications. This paper coins the term of farmsourcing asa professional crowdsourcing strategy in farming activities and provides a source of recommendations and inspirations for future collaborative actions in agricultural crowdsourcing.}

The seasonal and daily variation of the population-weighted exposure level (PWEL) in 2014 was estimated and compared. The results show that the population exposure to ambient air pollution differs significantly in the four seasons, and the exposure levels in winter and spring are notably higher than the other seasons; the exposure level changes greatly from North to South, and each sub-district maintains similarity to neighboring sub-districts.}

They are likely to be perceived due to their salience and they can be used as spatial reference points to memorize the locations of other spatial elements. In maps, landmarks are often represented as pictograms. Similar to real world objects, their likelihood to be perceived and used as spatial reference points depends on salience characteristics. In this paper, we investigate the structural salience of landmark pictograms in maps, based on their location relative to a task-relevant object. Using eye tracking, we aimed to identify distance parameters that predict the structural salience of landmark pictograms in an object location memory task. Additionally, we investigated whether the availability of structurally salient landmark pictograms improves object location memory. Our results show that landmark pictograms close to a to-be-learned object and the cardinal axes of the to-be-learned object were fixated more often. However, only the distance to the to-be-learned object was found to be related to object location memory performance. An increased location memory performance was observed when landmark pictograms were available close to the to-be-learned object. We argue that proximity of a landmark pictogram to a task-relevant object location and its cardinal axes can be used as parameters for its structural salience. We also found some first evidence that the availability of structurally salient landmark pictograms may improve object location memory performance.}

abstract = {Public transport in urban and suburban areas is not always able to meet population's need of accessibility to jobs, education, health and other opportunities in terms of routes and frequencies; therefore, those who do not own a private vehicle, or who cannot afford individual public transport (e.g. taxis), are often in a condition of social exclusion. Taking advantages of new ICT tools and facilities, Demand Responsive Shared Transport (DRST) services can provide “on demand” transport gathering ride bookings of different users and routing a fleet of vehicles to satisfy passengers' needs while minimizing the cost for the operator. In this paper, different DRST service configurations are compared to taxi services to investigate their economic attractiveness and sustainability. This is done by using an agent-based simulation model applied to the case of Ragusa (Italy), a city with poor public transport supply, where an innovative DRST service has already been experimented. A set of 50 different scenarios has been simulated, by varying the numbers of vehicles and seat capacity, and considering different demand rates and route choice strategies of the vehicles. Results are analyzed according to different key performance indicators, mainly showing that the DRST system is more advantageous than taxis when dealing with higher demand rates. On the other hand, the efficiency of the DRST system is rather limited compared to taxis in the case of low transport demand and fleets with a small number of vehicles. Between high and low demand there is a balance between the taxi and the DRST systems, where one should deepen the analysis to identify optimal operational parameters. These results pave the way for further analyses to help the planning and design of intermediate transport services like DRST, which are able to bridge the gap between collective and individual transport in urban and suburban areas.}

They are used not only to communicate, share, inform, educate, convince, and control, but also to collect data about their users, to sell ads and services, and to orient using the physical world as well as in the digital one. There are four main families of online atlases: national atlases, world atlases, road atlases, and community atlases.}

abstract = {Estimating health outcomes at a neighborhood scale is important for promoting urban health, yet costly and time-consuming. In this paper, we present a machine-learning-enabled approach to predicting the prevalence of six common non-communicable chronic diseases at the census tract level. We apply our approach to the City of Austin and show that our method can yield fairly accurate predictions. In searching for the best predictive models, we experiment with eight different machine learning algorithms and 60 predictor variables that characterize the social environment, the physical environment, and the aspects and degrees of neighborhood disorder. Our analysis suggests that (a) the sociodemographic and socioeconomic variables are the strongest predictors for tract-level health outcomes and (b) the historical records of 311 service requests can be a useful complementary data source as the information distilled from the 311 data often helps improve the models' performance. The machine learning models yielded from this study can help the public and city officials evaluate future scenarios and understand how changes in the neighborhood conditions can lead to changes in the health outcomes. By analyzing where the most significant discrepancies between the predicted and the actual values are, we will also be ready to identify areas of best practice and areas in need of greater investment or policy intervention.}

abstract = {On May 31st, 2019, a tornado hit the city of Talcahuano, Chile, generating significant damage to structures and leaving one person dead. The objective of the present paper is to report on damage to structures in Talcahuano. A preliminary survey was performed by the Municipality of Talcahuano and covered the entire affected area with a cellphone web application used to report the severity and distribution of damage. A more comprehensive damage survey was conducted in the Brisa del Sol neighborhood in the Medio Camino area by the UCSC team to assess the damage distribution within an area with well-defined and homogeneous building typologies. The results of the field surveys showed that the tornado behaved as a skipping tornado and that most damage to houses consisted of wall opening damage, roof sheathing failure, and wall cover removal (EF0), followed by partial roof removal (EF1). It was noticeable that self-built systems (house additions) were more damaged than original houses, which may be explained by the fact that such structures do not always meet minimum building standards. It is recommended that field surveys conducted by municipalities and the Ministry of Social Development consider typical damage types rather than just categories such as minor, moderate, or major. Finally, it is recommended that the feasibility of implementing mitigation measures such as stricter wind load provisions and dual-objective tornado design philosophy in the Concepción-Talcahuano area be analyzed.}

abstract = {As Chapter 2 illustrated, maps describe a wide variety of themes and employ many different visualization techniques to display them. While they have historically been drawn by hand, maps are often created today using a modern geographic contribution, geographic information systems (GIS). This field of study includes a broad collection of tools, techniques, and ways of thinking about spatial data and how it can be analyzed and displayed. Technicians collect field data with a GPS unit, analysts use desktop computers to make sense of spatial data, cartographers use GIS technology to visualize information, and policy-makers base decisions on map service providers engaged in the practice of GIS. With GIS, we can not only visualize spatial data, we can also analyze it for patterns to gain a better understanding of the natural and human world. Remote sensing (RS) is an overlapping field that centers on the use of raster imagery for monitoring and analyzing the world. Remotely sensed data are often used as a component of a GIS analysis. It is imperative that librarians be familiar with geospatial analysis and RS to assist clients in finding geospatial resources and creating instructional services for online mapping programs. This chapter defines and describes GIS and RS and how they can be used to study, monitor, and manage both natural and cultural factors in the world.}

abstract = {Smart cities are increasingly part of urban sustainability discourses. There is a growing interest in understanding how citizen engagement, connected technology, and data analytics can support sustainable development. Evidence has also repeatedly shown that green infrastructure such as urban forests address diverse urban challenges and are critical components of urban sustainability and resilience. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether green space and urban forest management are gaining significant traction in smart city planning. It is thus timely to consider whether and to what extent urban forests and other green spaces can be effectively integrated into smart city planning, to maximize green benefits for all city dwellers. We address this gap by exploring current and emerging smart city trends and technologies, and highlight practical applications for urban forest and green space management. Current “smart urban forest” projects reveal a focus on novel monitoring techniques using sensors and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, as well as open data and citizen engagement, particularly through the use of mobile devices, applications (“apps”), and open-source mapping platforms. We propose a definition and promising approach to “smart urban forest management”, emphasizing both the potential of digital infrastructure to enhance forest benefits and the facilitation of citizen stewardship and empowerment in green space planning. Cities are getting faster and smarter – can (and should) the trees, and their managers, do the same?}

It provides theoretical foundations for Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and the rational for research and development of GIS in mainstream ICT. Building on Masters level education we argue that more coordinated and structured education and training is required at the doctoral level. We developed a formalized doctoral education and research training programme in GIScience at the University of Salzburg, by integrating students in three focused, interconnected, interdisciplinary research clusters. We illustrate how this programme seeks to acknowledge spatial principles, to explore scientific and educational uses of geographic information in order to elucidate the complex relationships that individuals and society have with GIS. It provides a framework for „education through research’ programme.}

abstract = {Risk communication is a mutual process of understanding the risk among stakeholders and represents a measure to integrate lay knowledge into measures to prevent, mitigate, and deal with risk. Flood crisis communication, which takes place in the face of incoming danger, needs a practical and operative approach to cope with potentially destructive, large-scale natural disasters. Since floods are one of the most predictable georisks, communication is an efficient means to reduce risk, especially by reducing people's exposure. Many authors discussed the nature of risk communication. Regarding flood risk, most works are devoted to long-term communication plans, but more practical indications on how to communicate during - or shortly before - an (expected) emergency are lacking. Therefore, we present here a framework providing recommendations on what should be the information conveyed in a flood warning message and with what communication medium it should be issued, depending on the criticality level of the expected flood, on the resources of the institution in charge for the warning and on the specific advantages of each medium. Therefore, the framework shown in this paper provides an easy to employ handbook for civil protection operators to define the suitable content, shape and medium for warning messages toward the population. This framework addresses common issues such as the possibility of false alarms or the lack of personnel in charge of risk communication, as well as the role of social media (and their limits), that in many cases is still not well understood.}
