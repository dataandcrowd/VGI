# Welcome to the Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) Blog!

Thanks for visiting our repository :bowtie:. 

This blog is mainly contributed by the [Geographic Data Science Lab members](https://vgi.rbind.io/people/) at the University of Glasgow :umbrella:.


If you are new to VGI, please have a read through our webpage [link here](https://vgi.rbind.io/). <br>
If you have knowledge about VGI and want to know more about our activities, please stay tuned to our new blog posts. We will upload lots of useful information related to VGI but also how we experiment various data for our day-to day life. Our lab members enjoy trimming and displaying the data as a way of communicating with the world, and we strongly believe that we can make fresh discoveries through our activities. 


If you have any enquiries, please let us know by sending an email(ana.barisi@glasgow.ac.uk) or a DM via twitter(@AnahidBasiri)
