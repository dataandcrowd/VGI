<h1>Motivation for a Systematic Review</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Several papers have investigated possible factors that hinder the participation in crowdsourced mapping in their VGI projects</p></li>
<li><p>Most empirical studies have extensive questions which can be less generalisable</p></li>
<li><p>To our knowledge, none of the published reviews identified or analysed the available evidence from a strict systematic approach</p></li>

<div id="advantages-of-a-systematic-review" class="section level1">
<h1>Advantages of a Systematic Review</h1>
<ul>
<li>To improve decision that are maximally informed and minimally biased</li>
<li>The transparency of the selection criteria is a safe bet with academic markers and journal peer reviewers ⇒ “how and why were the studies included or excluded?”</li>
<li>Far less stressful and far more manageable</li>
